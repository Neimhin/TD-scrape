#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion whereby the subject of motion No. 20 is being referred to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food for discussion. It concerns the transfer of the abattoir licensing functions from the Department of Agriculture and Food to local authorities with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland providing an overall co-ordinating role. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has reached an agreement with county managers and local authority veterinarians on the transfer arrangement. It is proposed to take this item without debate; No. 2 is a motion relating to the Commission on Electronic Voting. The commission had considered that its first report could also be its final report and that it would, as set out in the legislation, be dissolved after the expiry of two months from its report unless the Government, by order, requested it to make further reports. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 provides for such an order to be so made. On 24 June, the Government asked the commission to make any necessary further reports about the work it envisaged in the recommendations of its first report on 30 April. The Government also asked the commission to include in such reports a comparative assessment of the current paper-based system for voting at elections and referendums. It will be considered without debate; No. 3, Water Services Bill 2003 — Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 7 p.m.; and No. 4, Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 7 p.m. and to conclude not later than 9 p.m. with spokespersons having 12 minutes and other Senators having eight minutes, and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the debate.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2	As we enter the last two weeks of the session, I appeal to the Leader of the House to do everything in her power to ensure the Opposition is informed at all stages of the Government's intentions in respect of proposed legislation. It always happens, as we reach the end of sessions, that Bills are rushed through and Departments put pressure on the House to accept all kinds of amendments at the last minute. We all understand that such behaviour has happened under various Governments over the years. I ask the Leader to work with the Opposition in the next two weeks to ensure all matters are properly debated.I wish to express my party's opposition to No. 4, the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004. We will oppose the Bill on Second Stage because we do not think there is any need for it. In effect, the legislation will provide another election slush fund for various Ministers in the run-up to the next general election. When the Minister for Finance first proposed the fund, he had the good grace to appoint an independent board to determine the charitable causes and good community projects that were to benefit from it. The Government has decided to take the money back under its control, to be used for its pet projects in certain constituencies.Fine Gael will oppose the Bill because it is contrary to the spirit of the initial recommendation that emerged from the Committee of Public Accounts. Even at this late stage, I ask the Government to reconsider this retrograde step, rather than rushing the legislation through the House in the final two weeks of the session. My comments are not intended as a reflection on the Leader, but as a criticism of the Government's determination to drive the Bill home. Its actions are contrary to its recommendations, specifically those of the Minister for Finance.Regarding No. 12, the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, the Leader is aware the House had an extensive and good debate on the matter two months ago, in the presence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The establishment of an independent ombudsman, who will assume the power of the Garda Complaints Authority and investigate independently all aspects of complaints made against the members of the force, is central to the Bill. Last week the authority produced its report, which shows again the inadequacies of the system. Why has it taken two months to bring the Bill to where it is today? Although we have had time to debate it, it has remained on the Order Paper. Arrangements for the Committee Stage debate should have been made by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Why has there been a delay in the appointment of an independent ombudsman to ensure proper accountability of policing? I ask the Leader to respond.Will the Leader make a statement in the House at some stage today about the Government's intentions in respect of banning children from public houses after a certain hour? I call for such a statement in light of the recent comments of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. A raft of legislation in this area has been passed by the Oireachtas in recent years. If the Government plans to rethink this issue, surely it will have to do so before Friday of next week. Can a change be made by order? I ask the Leader to clarify the Government's plans for a U-turn in this regard.

We should recognise the advances made by Fianna Fáil in proving in the Wexford area that the pen is mightier than the canvass and that it has restored the ancient art of letter writing to its rightful position.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	6	We will watch with interest to see how that will develop through the party. I will say no more about that because it is not my business.I do not object to No. 2 being taken without debate but on at least four occasions in the past two years I have raised the implications of the Abattoirs Act and the importance of certain aspects of it in terms of traceability of meat. When the joint committee has concluded its business on the Act I would like the House to have a debate on the impact of local involvement in the approval of abattoirs, which I regard as a positive step. The more localised beef production is the better. The fact that it would come off the land to the local abattoir and be sold in the local butchers is something we should support. I would like to hear a report on that when it comes back from committee.On several occasions here recently we asked that the Minister for Education and Science be invited to the House to explain a number of issues. I am sure people will have heard the media comment over the past two or three weeks on the cutbacks to The Ark in Dublin. The Ark is one of the most progressive developments in inner city and arts education in many years. It is a place where children are exposed to the arts, arts education is developed and teachers are developed in the arts. In particular, it is a place disadvantaged schools from throughout the inner city area visit to get exposure to the arts and to meet with teachers seconded to it to raise their level of appreciation and awareness. We are talking about a small amount of money in terms of this cutback and it is quite atrocious. Ten years ago, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, decided to bring forward a Green Paper on education which did not include any aspect of arts but there was outrage and uproar and it was changed immediately. This is a similar step backward. It is a blow to teacher education, arts appreciation, arts education, disadvantage in the inner city and to support for one of the major successes in the Temple Bar area. The most successful initiative in Temple Bar has been The Ark and I ask the Minister to come to the House and explain the reasons he is cutting back on this extraordinarily progressive aspect of education.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Yesterday in Iraq, sovereignty was handed back to an interim Iraqi Government, and Paul Bremer has now left that country. In that context, will President Bush and Prime Minister Blair now apologise to the people of Iraq and the international community for waging an illegal war since the start of last year against the wishes of many in the international community and the fundamental ethos of the United Nations? It is abhorrent that those two men can get away with what they perpetrated in that country over the past year.In that context also, during President Bush's visit to this country last weekend the protests in Shannon and elsewhere were peaceful and democratic. I realise there was much hype surrounding the visit and an expected level of violence in some quarters and it is good for democracy that that uglier element of protest did not prevail last weekend. It was good to see a forum in which people could protest peacefully.Some weeks ago there was a call for a debate on the controls in regard to the registers of electors. In the aftermath of an election many calls are made in that regard and then forgotten but this is an important issue. People's names were removed from electoral registers throughout the country, in many cases for political motives. That casts serious aspersions on the current system, which is wide open to abuse. An independent commission should be appointed to examine and overhaul the system. Such a commission should have absolute authority in deciding people's eligibility to vote and who should be on the register.Senator O'Toole commented in a humorous fashion on a very serious canvassing incident in County Wexford during the recent local elections. When the Taoiseach's signature is forged, serious questions must be raised about the abuses that take place in the highly charged atmosphere of an election. There are secondary issues that take the gloss off this incident, such as the abuse of Oireachtas envelopes. The largest victim is the body politic. I ask the Leader to ensure that Oireachtas committees recognise that such abuses and the forging of officeholders' signatures should be severely punished.

Traveller community leaders have condemned anti-social behaviour by their members. However, just as racist sentiments are avoided, anti-Traveller sentiment should not be cultivated. Anti-social behaviour in the settled community is treated as an aberration and the whole community is not condemned for it. A spokesperson for Pavee Point made the balanced suggestion that a reconciliation forum be established. This would be helpful and necessary before the issue gets out of hand. The Seanad could play an important role in having a debate, observed by the Traveller community leadership, on how to arrive at such a reconciliation. Every Member can point to Traveller families that have fought valiantly to adapt their position to a changing world. Many Travellers have made valuable contributions to society, such as in Irish traditional music for which the Traveller community's contribution is well noted. I ask the Leader to have a debate on this issue before the summer recess.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On a previous occasion I raised the issue of Travellers' convoys and recent incidents in Wexford and Ballyhaunis. I agree with Senator Ó Murchú that many Traveller families have integrated well in the community, such as in Rathkeale and Newcastle West. However, it is unfortunate that several bands of Travellers, moving between different locations during the summer months, bring disrepute to the whole Traveller community. I have asked that this be addressed through legislation. It is not satisfactory for authorities to use the Roads Acts to move on these groups. Strengthening legislation must be introduced to stop large groups of people coming together in different communities and causing mayhem. Inevitably, in these communities most of the businesses close due to fear. It is wrong that this is still allowed to happen. These groups must see how their activities are debasing the wider Traveller community. One always hears about rights but Travellers must recognise that the settled community also has rights. Their influx during the summer months into certain communities tells the settled community that its rights are debased.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I join Senator O'Toole in calling for a debate on the Abattoirs Act following discussion in the joint committee. The traceability of beef is an important matter. However, Members should welcome the announcement this week by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, on the labelling of beef from outside the EU, particularly from Argentina and Brazil.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Hear, hear.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It relates to beef sold through restaurants and catering establishments. Up to now the consumer could not distinguish from where the meat came. This is a great development for consumers and is important for farmers and Irish beef producers who have had particular difficulty in marketing their product against a sub-standard item produced largely in areas where growth promoters, hormones and antibiotics are still administered to cattle right up to the production of beef. The Minister has made an important move towards levelling the playing pitch for beef producers and increasing consumer confidence in Irish food.I join Senator McCarthy in congratulating Clare people on how they went about their business during the demonstration. One must also recognise the great work done by the Taoiseach and Romano Prodi in their meeting with President Bush at the EU-US summit. The Garda and Army also performed exceptionally well and did the country proud.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I agree with most of the sentiments expressed by Senator McCarthy and Senator Dooley. The protest was dignified and it was a great credit to the nation that everything passed off without any great difficulty.Newspapers have reported that the Government expressed regret about a very fine interview given by President Bush to a rather finer questioner, Carole Coleman. I would hate to think that, as has been reported by some newspapers, the Government apologised to President Bush for the attitude taken in the interview. This was a very probing interview but we should not take orders from the Americans on how our interviewers conduct themselves on air. Could the Leader tell us if the Government has expressed regret about this interview? I would prefer to hear that the Government was supportive of our broadcasters on this issue rather than President Bush. We are due a reply on this question because the matter is ambiguous and the freedom of the press is more important than the dictatorship of some President from the United States of America.Many months ago the House was given a promise that an auctioneering commission would be set up. It has not yet been established. We need an urgent response on this matter before the summer recess. I ask the Leader to comment on it.I understand there is a question as to whether the State Airports Bill will shortly come before this House or languish in the Lower House until after the summer recess. The House is due a full debate on the Bill and needs to know if it will come before it.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I support Senator Ó Murchú's call for a debate on the Traveller community before the summer recess. I am afraid that racism might arise. Two very good Traveller friends of mine live a very difficult life, one which I could not endure. An editorial in The Irish Times today said that if local authorities have not addressed the housing issue of Travellers who want to be settled, it should be given to another authority.I was very proud at the weekend of the summit backdrop formed by Dromoland Castle. The front page of yesterday's edition of The New York Times had a picture of the Taoiseach leading us very proudly there. I am also proud of the protestors and of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the civil servants and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.Last night I woke up wondering why anyone would worry about President Bush being seen in his vest at the window of his hotel when 850 Americans have been killed in Iraq along with 17,000 Iraqis, while 23,000 US members of the military have been sent home. Why should we worry about President Bush in his vest at the hotel window?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	15	That is not a matter for the Order of Business. We must have order as there are time constraints.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Last week a well known and reputable company in Dublin issued a letter to its employees stating it was no longer in a position to honour its commitment to a pension plan for them and that it would be winding it up. I have raised the pensions issue in the House on a number of occasions but it is reaching a new level when a company, which is doing well and whose directors paid themselves millions of euro in the past year by way of bonuses, is now winding up its pension plan and leaving its employees in a very worried state. In June 2003, we were told that no company had yet wound up its pension plan in this fashion. While I am aware of this matter because I was approached in regard to it, I do not know if other people are in the same position.We hear much about pensions and the pension time bomb from the Government, but this is the type of time bomb about which I am concerned. It explains why so many people are not taking out pension plans or PRSAs but instead are investing their money wisely in the private housing market. The pension industry needs to be examined.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I congratulate the Taoiseach on his role as President of the EU for the past six months, which is coming to an end this week. It included welcoming the accession countries on 1 May and bringing the draft treaty to a grand finale. I was proud of the role played by the Taoiseach, backup staff, including senior civil servants and the gardaí, during the EU-US summit last weekend. It was a delightful scene. I was proud to be Irish and to have the Taoiseach leading us, which was welcomed by everyone.In regard to a debate on the Traveller issue, I can speak at length on this matter because I was in the thick of it three years ago as a member of South Dublin County Council. I am very aware of the rights and responsibilities on both sides. I would welcome a debate on the issue regardless of whether it takes place prior to the summer recess. It is important to have a debate on the issue to differentiate between the good type of Travellers and the blackguards who have been causing problems in recent weeks. It would be timely to have a debate prior to the summer recess because these groups can again take over in various parts of the country.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Like other speakers, I am pleased the visit of President Bush last week went so well and I congratulate all those involved. Some people appear to have difficulty with what the Taoiseach says, but I normally find him a model of clarity. I was concerned, however, when he was asked about the transport of prisoners through Shannon Airport to Guantanamo Bay. He said UN Resolution 1546 states that member states should help the coalition forces in Iraq in whatever way they could. I read the resolution and I could see nothing about the transport of untried and unsentenced people. I would be very grateful if the Leader of the House could find out whether the Taoiseach meant "Yes" or "No".

As someone who believes in the glass being half full rather than half empty, this island has been transformed over the past decade. There has been a sea change in politics on the island. We are now entering the next crucial phase in the ongoing debate on the future of Northern Ireland and the Government will be involved in discussions with the British Government and the various parties in Northern Ireland. While it is at times useful for us to remain silent, it might be appropriate, if possible, to hold a debate next week on current issues regarding the peace process. Issues have remained outstanding since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement which must be finalised. The Agreement was accepted by the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, North and South, and it might be helpful if we reiterated some of the keystones of the Agreement in the Oireachtas. It is part of the ongoing need for dialogue between all sides.We must welcome the fact that an interim authority has been established in Iraq. While it is not perfect, it is the first time that the people of Iraq have had any small semblance of representational government. It is the first of many steps which will have to be taken and I welcome it as a move in the right direction.

It is important we exercise our freedom of expression and I thought the Garda presence there was unnecessarily high.With regard to freedom of expression, I was very proud of my former RTE colleague, Ms Carole Coleman, in her interview with President Bush last week.

We have often criticised the United States on its excesses and abuses but should today look towards a brighter future for Iraq.I agree with Senator Ross and most others that the interview with President Bush was carried out in a courteous and professional manner. However, I query that a Government spokesperson stated it showed a lack of respect to the Office of the President of the United States. The Government is at odds with the genuine beliefs of the majority of the Irish people, who believe it was courteous and professional. I have a difficulty with the fact an informal complaint was made to the Irish embassy. What is the difference between an informal complaint and a complaint? This House must protect the free press and interviewers.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	29	There was a great deal of praise in the House last week and today for the Irish handling of the EU Presidency and I do not take from that in the slightest way. However, I and others are disappointed the Government did not avail of the opportunity during its Presidency to enhance the status of the Irish language within the EU. Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party, has for years promised it would enhance our culture and heritage yet it has done nothing. Ireland is one of the few EU countries that does not have its language as an official language of the Union. It is important we debate this subject with regard to achieving similar status for the Irish language as other EU languages.

I am aware of a couple who were taken off the register without receiving written notification. They were very unimpressed when they went to vote on election day.I also ask that the Minister for Education and Science come to the House to explain why his Department left it until the eleventh hour to notify schools of the special needs allocation. It had the information for almost a year, but it left it until the day of the holidays to provide it to principals and schools. This should not be tolerated. One would imagine that the Department of Education and Science would be the smartest Department of all, but it certainly is not in this case.The issue of Travellers was raised. The main difficulty people have is with so-called commercial traders, who arrive in the summer and take over land. They sell couches, for example, at knock-down prices, take away the buyers' old couches and dump them on the land when they leave, costing the local authority thousands of euro. This should not be tolerated. The Criminal Assets Bureau should have a role in this area.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, asked me to ensure that no legislation would be rushed through in the final two weeks of the session. Last Thursday I listed the Bills we would be taking in the House, which subsequently appeared on the Order Paper. However, I take the Senator's point. Throughout this term we have tried to put clear lines between Second, Committee and Report Stages, sometimes leading to gaps when there are not enough people present to take Committee or Report Stages. Having provided time for such debate, I would expect there to be plenty of takers. Last week, in answer to Senator Tuffy, who asked me about a certain Bill, I stated that the Bill would not be rushed through the House. I will refer to that Bill shortly because Senator Ross asked a question about it.I was asked about the delay with the Garda Síochána Bill. I am not sure the mechanism being put in place by the Minister consists of an ombudsman, but I will inquire about the reason for the delay. I will also ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism about children in pubs and if there is to be an amendment to the relevant Bill. If so, we have not heard about it. I remain convinced that nobody wants to have a drink in a pub with children running around their legs, but that is another day's discussion.Senator Joe O'Toole praised the ancient art of letter-writing. I am a great letter-writer myself, but it is of a more sober kind, I am afraid.

He also mentioned the Ark children's centre in Dublin. This is an innovative project and young people and teachers have taken to it with great gusto. I will ask the Minister for Education and Science about the cutbacks, but perhaps someone could put the matter down for discussion on the Adjournment because it would be a suitable subject.Senator McCarthy mentioned the protests that took place at the visit of the American President, Mr. Bush, which were peaceful and, it appeared, democratic and happy. He also asked about the register of electors. This matter was mentioned last week by Senator Browne, who raised it again today. Every person in this House has examples of people being taken off the register. When we discussed this before, we took several examples of people who had been removed from the register and traced the process of their removal. There should be a more structured way of dealing with the problem, however. The Senator also mentioned forged signatures. This is a serious matter and should be the subject of further investigation.Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú mentioned the tension among Travelling communities and sought to use this Chamber as a reconciliation forum. He cited Travellers' love for traditional music and mentioned all they have done for it. There is an all-party committee on Travellers, of which I am a member, which is doing very good work. The Senator may join it if he wishes. I take the Senator's point regarding reconciliation. Senator Michael Finucane raised the issue of large numbers of people driving around the countryside and deciding to go into an area and cause trouble. There are rights all around which must be observed.Senator Dooley asked for a debate on the motion regarding abattoirs. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has made it mandatory that the country of origin of beef be declared. I am sure the Argentineans have their opinions about their beef but those who eat beef believe beef of Irish origin is better.Senator Ross agreed with the comments made by Senators McCarthy and Dooley. He raised the matter of the young woman who conducted an interview with the President of the United States. I thought she was stunning and proper and professional. Clearly the man is not used to being asked a question because every time the interviewer asked a question she was knocked back and treated almost as if she were a little girl. I thought she was very professional and stunning in doing her job.Regarding the Aer Rianta Bill, we cannot deal with it until we get it. I have been asked whether it will be lodged in the doldrums of the Lower House. It is still being debated there. We have been approached about it, but we do not have firm dates. We have a wad of legislation for this week and next week which has already been put to us and to which we have agreed. It is anticipated that the Dáil will adjourn for the summer recess on 8 July and that the Seanad will adjourn on the following day, given that we have kept more or less to the same schedule as the Dáil. I gave an assurance to Senator Tuffy that that Bill, no less than any other Bill, will not be rushed through this House.Senator White raised the issue of Travellers. She mentioned that she has friends within the Travelling community, which is good. The Senator also congratulated the Taoiseach, Ministers and senior civil servants who conducted their business so well during the visit of President Bush. She mentioned what President Bush was wearing. However, that is President Bush's own business. I cannot understand why people got upset about it.Senator Terry referred to the proposals of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Coughlan, regarding pensions. The Senator has raised the issue on about six occasions. Each week we have asked for the Minister to attend but we have not been able to fit this in. Perhaps we will be able to make time available next week to deal with this. I congratulate the Senator on her initiative within her party regarding forthcoming legislation. I was delighted to read about it last Friday.Senator Ormonde joined in congratulating everybody involved in the six-month Irish Presidency of the European Union. She also raised the Traveller issue.Senator Henry wanted to know whether I could ascertain the true meaning of the UN stipulation regarding the transport of untried prisoners through Shannon. She was unclear what the Taoiseach said in answer to a question about that. We will endeavour to find out.Senator Bradford referred to the tenth anniversary of the 1994 IRA ceasefire and suggested that we should debate the outstanding issues. He also mentioned Iraq. We have done enough giving out on the matter here. We welcome the setting up of an interim government and will be watching it carefully.Senator O'Meara raised the issue of the protests. She said she was the only one here who was on the other side.

I congratulate the Senator for going. She said she thought the Garda presence was high. However, if something happened we would be saying it was not high enough and asking where were the gardaí and why were they not doing their job. They did very well and it was good-natured. The piquancy of what he was doing at the window in his vest and the interview with Carole Coleman all lent to the whole scene. The Senator congratulated her ex-colleague.Senator Feighan welcomed the new Iraqi Government but disagreed with an Irish Government spokesperson's claim that Carole Coleman's interview showed a lack of respect to the office of the President of the United States. I doubt that happened. We have all been used to trenchant interviews. I cannot understand how the man has got to where he is without doing a decent interview. I will find out if that message was conveyed.Senator Bannon wants to enhance the status of the Irish language. We signed an all-party motion in this House on that matter, but the Senator wondered what the Government was doing about it. Senator Browne spoke about the register of electors. He has consistently raised that since the election. He has some bones to pick and we feel the same way on this side of the House about names being taken off the register. He asked about special needs teaching. They will be allocated this week when the schools have closed. Principals stay back to do that kind of work, but I know many parents are anxiously awaiting to find out whether their child will get one.Senator Ross raised the issue of auctioneering. Membership of the working group has been finalised and the first meeting of the group will be held in the first week in July.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Amendment No. 75 replaces the existing section 43 with an expanded version incorporating drains and distribution systems in addition to service connections and also providing for taking in charge such connections. It arises in the light of the revised definitions of "drain", "distribution system" and "service connection" in section 2. The purpose of expanding the scope of the existing provision to provide for its application to drains and distribution systems is to avoid the frustration of the section's application in particular instances, for example, with complex piping layouts in some industrial estates where there might be some doubt about whether a specific pipe comes under the legal definition of a service connection as distinct from a drain or distribution system. Existing powers to take in charge sewers, water mains or drains under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 apply only in the context of housing estate development and are for the purpose of compelling a planning authority to take in charge sewers, water mains, drains, roads and other open spaces when requested by the majority of relevant qualified electors. Section 43 of this Bill, as amended, will not affect the application of those provisions.Subsection (13) enables a water services authority to take such pipes in charge of its own volition and will, therefore, complement the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. In addition, it enables a water services authority, at its discretion, to take in charge any drain, distribution system or service connection, for example, on an industrial estate. Provision is included for appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction regarding a proposal by a water services authority to take in charge a connection to ensure that the rights of all parties involved are protected. However, it is anticipated that in many instances use of such powers will be at the prior request of the occupant, for example, where a householder agrees with the water services authority to take in charge a service connection for the purpose of its subsequent renewal and maintenance.I understand we are taking amendments Nos. 75 and 76 together. Perhaps I might give my view regarding amendment No. 76.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Certainly.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Senator Bannon is correct in his observation that the original wording of subsection (3), while providing some examples of the purpose for which the obligation to keep pipes in good order and repair should apply, failed to make reference to water conservation. We have re-examined that provision in the course of the overall review of the section and, on reflection, it is considered best to make the obligation absolute in the first instance. Any attempt to list the purposes for which the obligation to keep the pipes in good order and repair applies only renders the provision vulnerable to being undermined in its intent by claims that some slightly different circumstances apply in a given instance. The revised subsection (3) as set out in the Government amendment accordingly provides that those responsible for the repair and renewal of a connection have an absolute obligation in that regard. In those circumstances, I ask Senator Bannon to agree to the revised approach proposed. It is consequently a matter for him to withdraw the amendment. We have taken his views into consideration and incorporated them.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I am a little confused by the Minister's reply. For a moment I thought he was taking the amendment on board regarding the conservation of water, which should be in subsections (3) and (4). Regarding amendment No. 75, the Minister referred to the water services authority, as he proposes to call the new body. It will be cut off from the local authority in the event of the privatisation of the water supply and its management in future years. This issue concerns me greatly because it appears to be a lever with which to privatise the entire water supply. We are going in the same direction as the UK in this matter. Instead of thrashing the issues out properly at an earlier Stage, the Minister of State is now presenting a significant number of Government amendments, which concerns me greatly. It is an attempt to pull the wool over our eyes and those of the public in terms of the privatisation of the water supply throughout the country. The manner and approach of the Government in attempting to achieve that end will concern the public. The Minister of State is trying to lay the groundwork for privatisation within the next few years.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I am concerned by Senator Bannon's comments on privatisation as it is not my understanding. My constituency has one of the greatest numbers of group and other water schemes in the country. There are many EU regulations regarding water quality and the feedback indicates the EU is very insistent that local authorities provide water to group water schemes. We are moving away from the idea of small private schemes which use perhaps a river or a well as a source and it is wrong to contend we are now on a privatisation route. More local authorities are taking over group water schemes which is good because the trustees of these schemes cannot go on forever, nor would they wish to. The Minister of State's amendment stipulates that local authorities are responsible for the maintenance, renewal and upkeep of water schemes, which I welcome. I thank the Minister of State for his definition of what we mean by a "connection" and for the other definitions he has included in his amendment.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Senator Bannon is correct that I originally indicated my acceptance of amendment No. 76 but my amendment No. 75 offers an alternative approach to achieve the same purpose.Regarding privatisation, the water services authority is not a new body, rather it is a new name for the existing sanitary authorities. I had expected some Members to allude to privatisation, as was the case during the previous debate, but nothing in this Bill paves the way for privatisation. I am glad to have the opportunity to confirm the Government's position that the privatisation of water services is not contemplated. Those involved in the provision of water to rural areas through what we traditionally know as the group water schemes, which have been provided with State aid through the local authorities over the years, have provided an essential service for which they should be complimented.References to privatisation and to public private partnerships do not spell out a nationwide privatisation of the water supply. The design, build and operate provisions I refer to are all standard current arrangements. A new capital water services fund has been provided by my Department and design, build and operate provisions are operating prior to the enactment of this legislation. The public private partnerships will operate either on the basis of a contract between a water services authority and a private operator or a joint water services authority in arrangement with the private sector to provide the service. It is important to note that the norm is that the design, build and operate scheme will be for about 20 years. It is also important to note that the assets never become the property of the private partnership.Senator Bannon also made reference to the number of amendments. There are a substantial number of Government amendments. It must be recalled that the Bill was published last December. It was the first time there was an opportunity to embark on a consultation process. Many stakeholders are involved. There was an opportunity then, when the Bill was in the public arena, to consult with the local authorities. Many amendments have evolved as a result of that. When finalised, the Bill will be a much better legislation, not in the interests, necessarily, of the Minister and the Department, but of the people we represent. We have consulted with all of the local authorities, with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and with IBEC. Senators know the important role the rural water monitoring committee plays in the provision of water to rural areas. I hope I have made it clear there is no question of privatisation. It is not on the agenda.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Over the years we understood that local authorities were responsible for some eight to ten programmes, namely housing, roads, environmental issues etc. However, following its establishment, the National Roads Authority took a great deal of the powers away from the local authorities in respect of national primary and secondary routes. Now we are setting up the water services authority. This will be an umbrella for the local authority. It will be easy for a future government to cut off the water services authority from the local authority. It is opening an avenue for privatisation in the future. The Minister of State cannot disagree with me on that. Why not leave it in the remit of local authorities which are doing a fine job? My local authority, Longford County Council, has provided water to 95% of the population in the county by way of group water schemes etc. We have some of the best reservoirs in the country in Longford, giving an adequate supply of clean water. A big problem in our county, however, which is similar to that in other counties, is the lack of proper sewerage facilities in the towns and villages. There is a major shortfall in funding for sewerage schemes, which is causing contamination to the water supplies. In the last ten years enormous development has taken place in many villages and they are not able to cope because of the lack of properly constructed sewerage schemes. This is having an impact on ground water supplies. Perhaps the Minister could grant funding to applicant schemes from the different local authorities to construct sewerage schemes. That would be one way of cleaning up water supplies. The amount of raw sewage running into many of our waterways and water courses is disgraceful. It needs to be tackled if there is to be a guaranteed supply of clean water throughout the land.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Amendments Nos. 78 and 79 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I should explain the background to these amendments. Section 44 enables water services authorities, on request, to carry out repairs to service connections to which the owner does not have ready access because they cross neighbouring land. At present scope is confined to repairing connections. In certain circumstances, therefore, it may be open to being interpreted as not providing for replacing them. Unlikely as this may seem it is possible, for example, that someone might seek to draw such a distinction in an attempt to frustrate the operation of the section in the course of a dispute between neighbours in order to prevent the resolution of a problem with the service connection running under neighbouring land. In the circumstances it is considered prudent to provide specifically for the renewal of service connections in addition to their repair — and to remove any doubt as to the intention of section 44 in that regard. The amendment to section 44(1)(a) provides, accordingly, that service connections may be both repaired and renewed. In addition it corrects a syntax error in the original test. The amendment to section 44(1)(b) arises from amendment No. 78.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Over the years when small group water schemes were constructed by local committees to keep down the costs and to counteract the risk of major disruption to country roads, wayleaves were signed crossing lands etc., by the land owners. People had a right to cross those lands. If they needed to cross them to carry out repairs permission was given by means of the wayleave. Are these agreements now obsolete because of this section being included in the Bill? Perhaps the Minister of State could elaborate.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I welcome what the Minister of State has said. In my experience over the years, many disputes have arisen, particularly with small group water schemes, as regards the lack of rights of the owner of the land. There was a time when a land owner on whose field a spring or well was found, was entitled to free water. That was disputed and the cases would end up in the courts on some occasions. There were many such cases that John B. Keane could have written about as regards the ownership of lands or springs. They caused major problems for small schemes. I know of two water schemes where it was not possible to repair pipes that had broken down, as access was not forthcoming to the reservoir. I am glad the Minister of State has clarified that necessary repairs or renewal of a service connection will be dealt with on the lands in question. I hope we can agree to this section as it is important.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The Bill contains provisions on way-leaves. Amendments Nos. 78 and 79 to this section are somewhat different. There is no change to existing way-leaves. We want to ensure that in addition to repair work, renewal of service connections can be carried out. Previous legislation provides for repair of service connections only. However, there is a clear distinction between repair and renewal. While such an issue has never before arisen, a person who raised such an issue would be legally able to prevent the carrying out of renewal of services sited on his or her land. The new provision will overcome such problems. The consultation which took place on the Bill since published and the amendments now tabled will ensure the legislation is better than when first circulated.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	55	Amendment No. 81 is an alternative to Government amendment No. 80 and both may be discussed together by agreement.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	56	This amendment is necessary to broaden the application of section 45. Its effects will be to ensure that liability for damage to a pipe will apply whether caused directly or indirectly. Under the provision, as currently worded, it may not be possible to successfully prosecute a person who was engaged in construction work in the vicinity of a pipe owned by a water services authority and whose work, while not directly damaging a pipe, weakened the area around it leading to its damage at a later stage. The legislation as currently drafted could, in such circumstances, allow the person who indirectly caused the damage to escape liability.Such a restriction is not considered just or appropriate and was not intended, hence the substitution of "causes any damage" for the word "damages". In addition, the amendment updates the references to water pipe to include water mains and distribution systems. This aspect of the amendment arises from the series of amendments to section 2 to streamline and clarify the distinction between drains, sewers, water mains, distribution systems and service connections.As the amendment covers the same ground as amendment No. 81, perhaps the Senator would consider withdrawing his amendment. Amendment No. 80 is tantamount to the Senator's amendment and covers the same principle.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Minister of State is jumping the gun when he states the two amendments cover the same ground. Perhaps he will clarify who is responsible for damage caused to a mains. Will it be those working in the vicinity of such mains? Will the owners of the scheme, be it a local authority or private group sewerage or water scheme, be responsible for repairs even though they were not directly involved in the damage caused to the mains? Such liability can impose considerable burdens on group water schemes, all of which are voluntary. Local authority mains will be the responsibility of local authorities.Many of the people who set up group water schemes and group sewerage schemes in the 1960s and 1970s have moved on. There may not now be many personnel involved in ensuring such schemes are properly constructed and repaired. Perhaps the Minister of State will say if responsibility will automatically fall to the particular local authority to repair any damage caused by way of excavation, construction and so on.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The person or company who causes the damage shall be responsible for the repairs. Senator Bannon is correct when he states that many of the group water schemes were established some years ago. Where trustees pass on or retire, new trustees can be appointed. In short, the person responsible for the damage shall be the person or company who causes it.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I have been involved in a number of group water schemes down through the years and many of those with whom I worked on such schemes have now passed on. It is difficult to get people to put their names forward as trustees of a scheme given the implications involved. We need to introduce regulations in this area. Once a service is set up, nobody is willing to take on responsibility for its continuance. The Government needs to consider this issue in the context of those who take on the job of trustee when another passes on.Many schemes currently have only one trustee; in some instances there is no trustee attached to a scheme. Trustees are responsible for the spending of funds in banks, building societies, post offices and so on in regard to such schemes. This issue needs to be considered in the not too distant future.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The Bill makes provision for the replacement of trustees. We are all aware, having spent time on local authorities, that many group water schemes were anxious for various councils to take over such schemes. Many councils took over group water schemes which met the required standards. I realise it is difficult to find people willing to do the work and that this, in turn, is somewhat unfair to trustees. However, my experience has been that most trustees are professional and ensure necessary repair works are carried out.I would encourage individuals to take part in group water schemes which have played an important role in the provision of water as an essential service to many parts of rural Ireland in particular. While an issue arises in the context of who will undertake such responsibility, I believe it is possible to replace trustees. It does not necessarily follow that if one is a trustee one is in a position to carry out repairs. One is in a position to administer a scheme and to make the necessary arrangements for it. Group water schemes have served us well and I encourage people to continue to take part in them.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I move amendment No. 83:
In page 49, lines 7 and 8, to delete "Unless otherwise provided for in this Act or in any other enactment, no" and substitute "No".Legislation is supposed to bring clarity to certain matters. Section 46, as drafted, does not do so. It states on the one hand that the section means one thing and, on the other, states that it means something else. It goes without saying that other legislation might state something different on this issue. There is no need to muddy the waters with such a statement. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Section 46 updates sections 281 and 282 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878 which requires, inter alia, sanitary authorities to obtain prior approval from public authorities before undertaking work in their functional areas. To avoid disturbing the status quo between water services authorities, now sanitary authorities, and other public authorities, the Bill accordingly provides that nothing in this Bill shall be construed so as to set aside a requirement in other legislation for a water services authority to consult with or obtain the agreement of another public authority before undertaking work affecting a premises in which the public authority has an interest. For example, the approval of a harbour authority would be necessary before undertaking work in the harbour area.I cannot accept the amendment that has been proposed, which purports to remove any possibility that another provision might provide for a change in the status quo at any stage in this or another enactment. It would prevent alternative consultation requirements from applying. It is considered reasonable to acknowledge that such a change could occur. The tightening of the proposed provision could and would be over-ruled at any stage by a future Act of the Oireachtas. In such circumstances, a danger of conflict between section 46 and the relevant new provision would arise, necessitating a specific amendment to section 46. It is considered to be an unnecessary administrative exercise.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	63	In this amendment, I ask the Minister of State to delete the words "Unless otherwise provided for in this Act or in any other enactment". It is a conditional statement. There is no great clarity in this section as it stands. Perhaps the Minister will consider examining it again.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The amendment is considered unnecessary because the administrative exercise in question is unnecessary.

In page 49, subsection (2), line 26, after "Act" to insert "but not for the purpose of imposing a charge on an end user".The amendment allows for meters to be used to measure water usage. I do not want section 47 to be a vehicle for the introduction of water charges. When we debated the Bill previously, I stated that I thought it would be used for that purpose.

In page 50, lines 11 and 12, to delete all words from and including "that" in line 11 down to and including "functions" in line 12.Section 48 provides for ministerial discretion, which I would have considered to be imperative in every power. Why does this section expressly provide for ministerial discretion? Should I presume that the Minister's other powers under this Bill will not be exercised at his discretion? Will the Minister elaborate on the matter?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	68	As it is currently worded, section 48 requires the Minister to consult "any Minister of the Government" that he or she considers to be relevant before he or she makes regulations "requiring water services authorities or other persons prescribed" to undertake specified consultation in the course of the exercise of their functions. If I accept the amendment, the section will require the Minister to consult "any Minister of the Government" prior to agreeing any regulations. There is a potential ambiguity. If the amendment is accepted, the word "any" may be interpreted as relating to one or all Ministers. Such ambiguity could lead to difficulty in interpreting the section. A requirement for the Minister to consult all members of the Government before making regulations is not necessary and would place an unnecessary administrative burden on all concerned. I regret that I am unable to accept the amendment for the reasons I mentioned.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Section 50 enables a water services authority to enter into an agreement with any person to provide water services, subject to planning permission requirements. Such an agreement can be reached with a view to the subsequent transfer of ownership of the infrastructure from the person in question to the water services authority. The amendment proposes to restrict the requirement to take planning permissions into account to relevant planning permissions only. It will avoid any confusion about the intention of the Bill in this respect. It is considered that the Bill's requirement to take into account planning permissions, as currently drafted, is too broad. It could lead to difficulty in the application of the provision, or to vexatious actions designed to frustrate its application.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I move amendment No. 90:
In page 50, subsection (1), line 34, after "agreement" to insert "in relation to the discharge of its functions under this Act".We need to limit the scope of the agreements into which a water services authority can enter. I propose that an authority may enter into agreements only if they relate to the discharge of its functions under the Act. Perhaps the Minister of State will accept this important amendment. It should be accepted.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Section 50 enables a water services authority to enter into an agreement with any person to provide water service infrastructure, with a view to that person subsequently transferring ownership to the authority. Therefore, the agreement to which Senator Bannon referred does not relate directly to the discharge of its functions per se by a water services authority. On the other hand, the specific purpose of the agreement has already been set out in detail in sections 50(2) and 50(3). In the circumstances, I believe that the amendment is unnecessary. It could conflict with the provisions of the subsections I mentioned.

In page 50, subsection (2), line 36 after "person" to insert ", for a fixed charge".We are all familiar with the spiralling costs of the large and small contracts into which the Government has entered, at the expense of the taxpayer. Perhaps fewer contracts will be entered into now that there have been such changes in local authority personnel. We will scrutinise such contracts in greater detail.

We know from our experience of cronyism that contracts that were agreed went three times beyond what the agreement was on the day. That is something we have to guard against and I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I support the thrust of the amendment. The local authority I was a member of was controlled by Fianna Gael and Labour. Sadly, that is no longer the case as it is now controlled by Fine Gael.There is an issue in terms of transparency of contracts and the whole tender process. I can recall at divisional and full meetings, officials, as they are required, opening the tenders in the presence of the members, rattling off the figures in those tenders and then leaving. The power to make a decision as to who was awarded a contract was not a reserved function, therefore the input of members was minimal. The process whereby officials opened tenders at meetings during which many issues were discussed, and members were not involved in the decision-making process to decide who got a contract, was just a visual exercise. There is an important point in regard to that process and I appeal to the Minister to look favourably on this amendment.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The insertion of a provision restricting agreements under this section to fixed charge agreements is unnecessarily restrictive and pre-empts any ongoing development in public procurement policy. The purpose of this section is to enable a water services authority to enter into an agreement with a person to provide water services infrastructure with a view to that person subsequently transferring ownership of it to the water services authority.While I understand Senators Bannon and McCarthy's concerns about control of costs, such control is best exercised within the framework of current public procurement policy. Inclusion of a requirement for fixed cost agreements in subsection (2) may lead ultimately to a lack of synchronisation between this provision and public procurement policy. Fixed cost agreements may not necessarily be the best solution in all cases and it is best that water services authorities be guided by ongoing public procurement policy rather than be restricted to a particular course of action by this Bill.Members will be aware there are strict rules governing public procurement, including EU requirements. If there are to be fixed costs it may be that we would not have the element of competition. Having fixed costs does not necessarily mean the taxpayer may benefit. Supply and demand will dictate things. Members may be aware it is not necessarily the lowest costs but, all things being equal, the lowest tender that will get the contract. The regulations on contract documents have to be in order and I am a great believer in the provision of public procurement policy.As for vigilance, one does not necessarily have to have a Government in power to be vigilant. All the tenders are there for members to see, and members witness the opening of tenders to ensure nothing is slipped into the box subsequently. I do not appreciate, therefore, the reference to cronyism. I have spent 25 years in public life and I do not believe I have ever come across a situation whereby a tender was selected on any basis other than on that which was best for the local authority, the water services or the taxpayers' interest. If we were to introduce fixed charges we might find many contractors would not be interested or that only a small group would be interested, which could lead to an escalation rather than a reduction of costs.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	83	With regard to what the Minister said, it is important that some mechanism be devised whereby the list of tenders for a particular job is published in the county manager's orders. As Senator McCarthy said, there should be a tenders committee and the three or four members on that committee should initial the outside of the envelope and the documents, which would then be passed on. That would be the last the members would see of those contracts. The names of those who tender should appear in the county manager's orders to highlight full transparency in regard to the particular job. Nobody, including the contractors, could be aggrieved about that. One often hears someone complain afterwards that they were within X euro of achieving a contract or that they were lower than what the contractor was taking etc. If they had an agreement they could dispute it if they had the figures and reasons could be given as to why the contract was not taken. That would bring greater transparency to the area of local government and the various authorities established by Government. It would be an open and transparent process.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Section 51 provides for the powers of a water services provider to temporarily interrupt services for maintenance purposes or where there is a risk to human health or the environment. The first of these amendments removes the seven day, prior notice stipulation from subsection (3) in regard to planned interruption of water services. It is not considered appropriate on a practical, operational level to prescribe a specific time period for notification of the interruption of services.Shortened interruptions, often late at night and of minimal duration, are routinely necessary to allow technical adjustments of calibration to take place and to facilitate checking for leakage. Such interruptions take place overnight and the consumer would generally be unaware of their occurrence. It would neither be practical nor reasonable to give seven days' notice of such actions. A similar approach is taken in other jurisdictions.Removal of the seven day notice requirement is complemented by the second amendment which enables the Minister to issue guidance as to what reasonably could be regarded as an appropriate alternative supply of drinking water for domestic purposes for the purposes of the fulfilment by a water services provider of its obligations under subsection (4)(b) to provide such a supply. It further provides that the exercise by a water services provider of its authority under this section to temporarily interrupt a water supply shall be subject to compliance with any such guidance. Amendment No. 94 ensures the interests of consumers continue to be protected.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the powers under section 52 to recover sums due can be duly assigned to any person performing a function under the Act. Section 52 provides generally that a county or city council acting in its capacity as a water services authority or its agent may recover any sum due to the authority either through the courts or by deduction from any other moneys owed by the council to the debtor or, as appropriate, by registering a charge on a premises owned by a debtor.Subsection (6) enables the Minister, by regulations, to assign the powers to recover moneys under this section to other persons. As currently worded, however, this could be interpreted as only applying to the recovery of moneys owed to a water services authority whereas it is intended the regulations could specify other persons to whom a sum is due under the Act, and it could use the powers available under section 52 to effect that recovery.

However, I detect in his contribution that this may be a channel to reintroduce water charges. Does a water service cover the supply of water or the connection to a mains? Will that involve a group taking responsibility? Will the Minister of State elaborate if this is really a water charge?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I am referring to any debt that would be due to a county or city council acting in its capacity as a water services authority. Section 52(6) enables the Minister to assign his powers to others, such as a group water scheme or contractors, to recover debts over and above the water services authority. This amendment provides the mechanism — nothing more, nothing less — for them to do so.

I am delighted to confirm that there are no domestic water charges and the Government does not intend introducing them, whether Senator Bannon welcomes this or not. The Bill does not contain any provisions for the introduction of water charges. Instead, primary legislation would be required to introduce them. Nor does the Bill empower the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, by way of regulation or otherwise, to introduce water charges.

In page 52, subsection (1)(c), line 20, after “authority” to insert “to a material extent”.Section 53 prohibits the waste of or unauthorised use of a connection to a water supply. However, this section is overly bureaucratic as it can be construed that wasting a glass of water is an equal offence to wasting 1,000 gallons.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	102	In considering this amendment, I regarded the extent to which it would bring clarity to the intended meaning of the section. However, nothing sufficient will be gained by the addition of the term "to a material extent" to warrant its inclusion in the text.Ultimately, it will be a matter for the courts to decide whether an action of an accused person amounts to wilful waste of water. In doing so, the courts will view each case on its individual merits. It is reasonable to expect that no court will entertain any perverse prosecution based on the waste of negligible amounts of water, just as it is reasonable to expect that such a prosecution would not be brought in the first instance.Insertion of a reference to "material extent" implies that if the level of wastage was immaterial, a prosecution might well be brought. Such a prosecution is not tenable and prosecuting authorities do not act in such a manner. If any did, a judge would rightly throw the case out.Should clarification be required as to the circumstances in which a water services authority might undertake action leading to prosecution under this section, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is provided with sufficient powers under section 30(4)(i) to issue any necessary directions. I hope Senator McCarthy will appreciate I am not in a position to accept his amendment.

In page 52, subsection (1), line 28, after "shall" to insert "take such steps as are reasonably within his or her control to".My highly-skilled parliamentary team informed me that the Bill takes a too bureaucratic line, which this amendment proposes to address. Occupiers can do little to ensure that the water on their premises meets prescribed quality standards. I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment in the context of good and comprehensible legislation. Legislation and Departments should be more user-friendly. There has been a concerted effort in recent years by Departments to reduce mumbo-jumbo terminology that some may find too bureaucratic. Relaxing the overall element of bureaucracy in the Bill will make it more comprehensible. I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The vicinities of chip shops and others are covered under the environmental protection Acts. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect the proprietors of busy pubs and restaurants to take responsibility for their premises. This amendment goes too far as the section already puts the onus on the proprietors.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The intention of these amendments is similar to the earlier proposal to amend section 53 by inserting a reference to wastage of water to a material extent. It can be reasonably expected that in considering whether an offence has been committed under section 54(1) and (2), a court will not find against the owner of a premises in circumstances where the event for which they have been prosecuted happened because of circumstances beyond his or her control, such as damage by a third party or an act of God.The main objective of the section is to ensure that subsequent to the discovery of a problem with a distribution system in a particular premises, sufficient powers are available to ensure that remedial action is taken. An owner is, therefore, obliged to carry out necessary remedial works as directed by a water services authority, unless the authority decides to carry it out itself, regardless of whether the owner can be blamed for the cause of the inadequacy in the system in the first instance. Qualification of this by the insertion of reference to steps that are reasonably within the control of the owner could undermine the effectiveness of this provision. An owner might argue, for example, that because he or she could not undertake the necessary remedial works, that obligation could not be applied to him or her. As currently provided for in the Bill, the duties ofcare in subsections (1) and (2) are stated in absolute terms. The intention behind this approach is to leave it to the wisdom of the court to decide whether they can reasonably be applied in given circumstances. This is a reasonable approach.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Amendment No. 99 has already been discussed with amendment No. 57. The reference to subsection (3) in the amendment should be to subsection (1).

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	109	This amendment incorporates a series of changes and updates to section 55 to expand its scope and synchronise it with similar provisions to section 61 with regard to connection to waste water services. The entire section as revised is reproduced as one amendment to facilitate a clearer understanding of the effects of the various changes to the existing text. Section 55 prohibits unauthorised connection to water supplies and enables a water services authority to require that pipes be opened for inspection prior to connection to its water supply or that of its agent.The amendment expands the scope of the original section 55 to include, in addition to prohibiting the unauthorised connection of a premises to a supply, an explicit prohibition on taking a supply without permission. The additional provision will, for example, prohibit the unauthorised connection of hoses and standpipes to public water mains during the course of building works. The amendment also synchronises section 55 with the revised definition of service connection in section 2 and ensures that any related pipes and fittings are also included within the scope of the section. Good defence clauses are introduced to ensure synchronisation with the similar provision in section 61 regarding connection to waste water services. The new wording is couched in terms of connection to a water supply rather than a specific water supply pipe so it is not confined to the actual point of connection of a pipe to a water main, but can be applied to any connection made to a water supply network at any point.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	110	This amendment arises from a series of amendments to section 2 to streamline and clarify the distinction between water mains, distribution system and service connections. The insertion of reference to a service connection in line 1 will ensure that the prohibition on pollution of water supplies applies from the moment the water enters the pipe in the water works to its point of delivery to the consumer.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I would like clarity regarding service connection. From time to time throughout the country service connections are made on a temporary basis to provide a supply to a new house, for example, until such time as a mains passes the house, a group water scheme is established or the local authority mains supply is extended. Service connection is something that is fairly loosely applied in many areas. If one has one's own independent water supply one can bring service connections to various parts of a farm, for example. In bygone days substandard piping was used. Anyone can make a service connection to a building site. Bringing it to such a site or to a landfill site, for example, tends to cause contamination of the water supply. The Minister of State might elaborate a little further.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	112	We should clear up any ambiguity in this area and explain what is a service connection. Senator Bannon may have been misinformed if he is thinking of a service connection as providing a water service to works in progress on a building site. The service connection I refer to in this respect is in essence the pipe which runs between the outer boundary of a premises and the sewer or water mains as the case may be. The issue of responsibility for the maintenance of service connections has been raised with the Department and specifically by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to individual complaints. That office has expressed the view that existing legislation is potentially unfair in requiring owners or occupiers to bear the cost of repairs to service connections in all cases. A service connection is the point where the connection is made and not what I or others may have interpreted as providing a service to an ongoing building site.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	113	There are three aspects to this amendment. The first is the expansion of the scope of the section from sewers to include waste water works. Another aspect is the simplification of the terminology and the third is the application of the maintenance obligations under the section to all providers of water services regardless of whether they are under contract.Under section 60 as currently drafted, all services providers are required to keep their sewers in good order. This is intended to apply to all elements of the waste water collection and treatment process. However, in the light of the revised definitions of sewer and waste water works in section 2, the use of the word "sewer" confines the scope of this section to a narrow field of application incorporating only the actual sewer pipes through which effluent is collected. Substitution of the term "waste water works" ensures that the maintenance obligations apply to all elements of a water service provider's waste water collection and treatment infrastructure.The second aspect relates to the simplification of the terminology. Replacement of the detailed statement of obligation for waste water works to be cleansed, emptied, covered and properly constructed with a simpler requirement for them to be maintained is intended to avoid possible loopholes arising from over-defining the obligation, resulting in a consequential restriction on its scope. It is envisaged that the requirement to maintain the infrastructure which amounts to the same as that being replaced will be capable of a flexible reasoned interpretation to accommodate the commonly understood meaning of the term "at the discretion of the courts". The original wording of subsection (1) places the obligations under the section on water services authorities, their public-private partnership partners and authorised providers of water services. The amendment expands this obligation to include persons operating with, or on behalf of, authorised water services providers under contract. It is part of a series of similar amendments to the text of the Bill to ensure relevant powers and duties under the Bill apply also to that category of water services provider. It is considered appropriate and equitable that such an obligation exists for a water services authority and an authorised provider for water services. While these obligations have been extended to the PPP partner of a water services authority, they should also be extended to the PPP partner of the authorised water services provider.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I am pleased the Government is taking full responsibility for this matter under paragraph (a) where there is likely to be a risk to human health. In the past, asbestos piping was used to distribute water along public roads, and the Government is taking full responsibility for the asbestos piping throughout the country. It is important for the Minister of State to carry out an audit of the areas throughout the country where asbestos piping was used. This should be rectified by way of upgrading and updating group schemes and regional schemes. It has been brought to my notice on many occasions that asbestos was used. The Government is taking full responsibility for this in the amendment and it will be held accountable for any health risks that may occur from poor quality or asbestos piping in water mains throughout the country.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I want to clarify the position in regard to public schemes expenditure. The Government has not been found wanting in regard to increases in public schemes expenditure. In the period 1997-2003, Exchequer expenditure on water infrastructure increased by128%, from €207 million to €471 million. The Government has a commitment to water infrastructure under the current national development plan, which is reflected in the €4.4 billion being made available for the period 2002-06. The purpose of this is to deliver a first class water service to the people. The spend is three times greater than that invested in the previous national plan.On the rural water programme, in 2004 the Government allocated €100 million, four times that allocated in 1997. The Government is taking seriously its responsibility and providing substantial funds to upgrade and provide new schemes throughout the country.

Will the Minister of State give a guarantee that the mains water piping installed in the past throughout the country will not pose a risk to human health? I would like clarity on the issue because communities are concerned that some mains which were put in place in the 1960s and early 1970s included asbestos piping which can cause serious damage to people's health. There is an onus on the Minister of State and the Government to ensure anything that might pose a health risk is removed forthwith, no matter what the cost. There is an onus on the Government to ensure the use of asbestos piping to distribute water throughout the country, including our towns and villages, is discontinued.

I would be alarmed to learn that drinking water is running through asbestos piping. Obviously Senator Bannon is thinking of a specific scheme. I would like if he could bring details of any such scheme to me and I will pursue the matter with the relevant local authority. As far as I am aware, there are no schemes where asbestos piping is currently being used, but if there are, I will be pleased to receive details from the Senator and pursue the matter with the relevant local authority. The €4.4 billion commitment over the period 2002-06 is ample proof of the Government's commitment to providing top quality water throughout the country.

Arising from the series of amendments to section 2 to streamline and clarify the distinction between drains, sewers and service connections, many of the provisions in section 62 in regard to drains have been incorporated into the revised section 43 and are now redundant. Amendment No. 75 refers to drains and subsections (1), (2) and (3) are being deleted accordingly. Subsections (4), (5) and (6) are also being updated in light of the amendments to section 2 so as to incorporate reference to service connections, thus ensuring all drainage connecting premises to a sewer is provided for.The provisions in question enable the water services authority, where it considers that a premises, regardless of whether its drainage is defective or neglected, is not drained satisfactorily, to issue a notice under section 42, requiring the owner of the premises to connect to a sewer. Such notice could issue, for instance, where a premises was found under examination to be drained to a sceptic tank and the water services authorities wanted it to be connected to a nearby sewerage scheme. In addition to the normal procedure, subsections 42(4) and (5) provide that the water services authority may provide the connection or contribute to the cost at its discretion.

It expands the scope of paragraph (b)(iii) to provide for the testing of a sewer not alone where a water services authority has grounds to believe it may permit the infiltration of water but also where it considers it might permit waste water to leak out. The expansion of the scope of the paragraph is intended to cover all eventualities and to prevent spurious challenges to any intervention by a water services authority, for example, on the grounds of difficulty in providing infiltration rather than leakage of water, not withstanding the poor state of repair of a particular pipe.

In page 62, subsection (7), line 47, after "or" to insert "at any time".Amendment No. 117 is a technical amendment to clarify the second part of section 63(7). The purpose of amendment No. 118 is to take into account circumstances where there might be intermittent or negligible use, or all but total abandonment of a licence. The amendment seeks to avoid a situation where the loss of a licence could be avoided by a day's use. I hope the Minister will consider accepting both amendments.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Section 63(7) provides that where a trade effluent discharge authorised by a licence has not been made for three years, the licence shall cease to have effect. The provision, which is based on the existing provisions for trade effluent licensing under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, which are being consolidated into the Bill, is intended to weed out dormant licences and ensure that all licences are relevant and current. Where a licensed operation has not discharged relevant effluent for a period of three years it is considered reasonable to assume that the licence is no longer necessary.It is possible that a particular operation might be licensed for occasional sporadic discharge and may, quite legitimately in accordance with its licence, over a four year period not discharge for a cumulative period of more than three years. In such circumstances, it is not envisaged that a licence should be considered to be dormant or to have ceased to have effect.The existing provision, based on the original 1997 legislation, has stood the test of time. The three year requirement has proven to be effective and has not caused any operational difficulties. I recognise the points made by Senator Bannon but do not think the amendments are necessary. In the circumstances, I regret that I am unable to accept them.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional grounds under which a water services authority may review a trade effluent discharge licence issued under section 63. In addition to the existing grounds, it will enable a review to be carried out at the discretion of a water services authority in two further circumstances: where the capacity of the relevant waste water treatment plant properly to treat the trade effluent discharge has been or is likely to be exceeded; and where a drain or a service connection, or part of it, through which trade effluent is discharged to a sewer under a licence is itself declared to be a sewer under section 69. Paragraphs (e) and (f) remain unchanged and the additional paragraph (g) enables a water services authority to review a trade effluent discharge licence where the capacity of the treatment works into which the effluent is to eventually discharge is exceeded or likely to be exceeded.This is a necessary provision to ensure that the integrity of the authority's waste water treatment process is maintained. A water services authority may, for example, decide to require a licensee to carry out a specified level of pre-treatment in order to preserve some of its own treatment capacity and it could set out requirements in this regard in the conditions of a revised licence issued following the review.With regard to paragraph (h), it is envisaged that the powers under section 69 to declare a drain or service connection to be a sewer under the control of a water services authority could be invoked, for example, in the case of a complex drainage system in an industrial estate in order to facilitate the application of trade effluent licensing requirements to a particular industrial outlet. In such circumstances, an existing trade effluent licence may need to be reviewed to ensure it is synchronised properly with the new licence issued to the individual industrial outlet.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	132	These amendments replace reference in section 66(1) to "The occupier of a premises" with reference to a person causing a discharge. Their purpose is to identify more precisely who may make an appeal under this section in regard to a decision on a trade effluent discharge licence. Section 66 provides for appeal of decisions on licence applications or licence reviews under sections 63 and 65. It is essentially a restatement of similar provisions under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act which had been repealed and consolidated in the Bill.It has come to notice in the course of consultations following publication of the Bill that the use of the term "occupier" has on occasion caused some disruption to the operation of the licensing appeals system under the water pollution Acts. Difficulties can arise, for example, in the case of a dispute between a landlord and a tenant over who is the rightful legal occupier of a premises and therefore has the right to bring an appeal.The purpose of these amendments is to remove any doubt in this respect. They express without equivocation that the right of appeal applies to the person who is causing the discharge concerned, regardless of any tenancy issues. The revised wording reflects the style of wording in section 63 and is concerned with the requirement to apply for a licence in the first instance and will allow An Bord Pleanála to proceed with an appeal without delay while any dispute over legal occupancy is resolved separately through appropriate channels.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	134	The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the powers of An Bord Pleanála in dealing with an appeal under section 66 relating to a trade effluent discharge licence and to give it additional powers of direction for this purpose. The current wording of subsection (2) is based on the provision in section 20 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, as amended by section 15 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act 1990, which has been consolidated into the Bill.However, the Department has been made aware of the difficulty with the application of this provision. The board is only given two options in determining an appeal in that it may either allow or refuse it. Technically, therefore, it cannot make a direction to a licensing authority about the attachment of specified conditions unless it has committed itself to either option. In cases in which it might agree substantially but not fully with an appellant's argument, therefore, the board needs additional powers, while neither allowing nor refusing an appeal, simply to direct the Water Services Authority to make specified amendments to licensing conditions. The proposed amendment will therefore enable the board first, to allow or refuse an appeal or second, to direct the Water Services Authority about the granting of a licence or the variation of a licence by amendment, definition or addition of specified conditions.Amendment No. 124 covers the same purpose as amendment No. 125 in the name of Senator Bannon and amendment No. 125 is, therefore, superfluous. In view of this I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing it.

I wished to insert the words "in whole or part" after the word "appeal" in section 67(2). As the Minister of State said earlier, subsection (2) as drafted appears to limit the power of An Bord Pleanála to refuse an appeal. There does not appear to be any middle ground. My amendment simply proposes to clarify this section. The Government amendment was explained satisfactorily by the Minister of State.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The purpose of amendment No. 169, which inserts a new section, section 102, is to bring together the provisions of the Bill and the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts which deal with the determination of fees for appeals to An Bord Pleanála and to align with provisions for appeals to the board under the planning code. It will facilitate the application of uniform procedures by the board in respect of the various appeals processes for which it has responsibility and further streamline the regulatory process.The text of the proposed new section is based on similar provisions in section 144 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The new section enables the board to determine fees for appeals under section 66 of the Bill in the matter of licensing of trade effluent discharges to sewers under section 63. In addition, it may determine fees for appeals under section 8 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1997, as amended by section 6 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act 1990, in the matter of licensing of trade effluent discharge to waters. However, either such determination will be subject to the approval of the Minister in the first instance.Subsection (2) provides that once the Minister has approved the first set of fees, the board is required to review them at intervals of not more than three years and may increase them thereafter in line with the consumer price index without further recourse to the Minister. The consumer price index is defined for the purposes of this section and subsection (3). Under subsection (4), eight weeks' public notification is required before fees that are determined or revised under this section come into effect. Subsection (5) is a transitional provision to enable fees determined in accordance with regulations made under section 6(2)(a) and (b) of the 1977 Act, inserted by section 4 of the 1990 Act, to remain in force until fees are determined by the board under this section. Section 6(2)(a) and (b) are, in turn, being repealed by amendment No. 203. Subsection (6) replaces subsections 67(4) and (5), which are being deleted under amendment No. 130.Arising from amendment No. 169, references in section 67 to making regulations for fees payable to An Bord Pleanála for appeals to it under section 66 in the matter of licensing decisions under sections 63 and 65 are no longer appropriate. Amendments Nos. 126 to 128, inclusive and No. 131 delete subsection (2), paragraph (i) of section 67 and all subsequent references to it accordingly. Under amendment No. 130, subsections (4) and (5) of section 67 are being deleted. They are being incorporated in the new section 102 by amendment No. 169 in order to consolidate all provisions to do with fees for appeals to An Bord Pleanála into one section. Amendment No. 129 is an incidental technical amendment to correct a syntax error.

In page 68, subsection (2), lines 42 and 43, to delete all words from and including ", and" in line 42 down to and including "facilities" in line 43.The Minister of State may want to call my bluff on this one. He said earlier that he did not know where we stood on water charges and charges of various kinds. The Government got its answer in the recent local and European elections.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	145	On amendment No. 132, section 68 enables a water services authority to provide pump-out facilities for boats, tour buses and caravans, to mention but a few. The provision is intended to facilitate the involvement of local authorities in the development of leisure and amenity facilities in their areas. The section is based on section 27(2) of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1997 which is being repealed and consolidated into this Bill. The purpose of subsections (2) and (3) is to remove any impediment to charging for the use of facilities provided under this section arising from a general prohibition on charging for domestic water services, for example, in the case of a family on a touring holiday in a camper van claiming that they were entitled to free services to meet their domestic needs. In circumstances where a local authority goes to the trouble and expense of providing pump-out facilities for boats, camper vans or for the convenience of tourists and day trippers, it is only reasonable that it should be in a position to charge for their use.Similar arrangements apply to the provision of other leisure facilities by local authorities, such as swimming pools, and are necessary to encourage and stimulate the development of tourism infrastructure.For the avoidance of doubt, explicit provision is included in subsection (3) to the effect that, notwithstanding their use of temporary accommodation, a Traveller community household, as with any household in the wider community, is entitled to free water services provision for domestic purposes. This will ensure that the Traveller community continues to be treated in the same manner as the broader community for the purpose of the application of water charges.In honesty, I do not believe Senator Bannon would want me to accept this amendment. The existing provision does not affect in any way the prohibition on charging for general domestic services and provides only for recovery of the cost of additional services provided to facilitate the pursuit of leisure interests. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	146	This amendment inserts an additional paragraph (a) into subsection (1) to provide that any reference to a drain in section 69 shall be construed as meaning both a drain and a service connection. Its purpose is to ensure that any pipe draining a premises into a sewer comes within the scope of this section and can thus be declared to be a sewer, with a view to requiring any person discharging trade effluent to it to apply for a trade effluent licence under section 63.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	147	Amendments Nos. 134 and 140 are related and may be discussed together. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Section 69 enables a water services authority to declare that a particular drain shall in future be regarded as a sewer under its control. This amendment substitutes subsection (2) with a revised provision restricting its operation to applying only for the purposes of section 63. The revised provision also stipulates that the drain will be regarded as a sewer under the control of a water services authority for the purpose of applying the licensing requirements of section 63 only and for no other purpose.The current wording is based on a similar provision in section 16 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, which is being consolidated in this Bill. However, while reference to "the purposes of this Act" in the 1977 Act was, in effect, confined to monitoring or licensing of discharges from affected drains, the scope of the Water Services Bill 2003 is significantly wider. For example, as currently worded, subsection (2) would enable a water services authority to exercise its general property acquisition powers under the Bill to take over a designated pipe completely. Such an infringement of private property rights would not be appropriate without an associated provision for third party appeals. Provisions to this effect are included under section 43, as amended.The purpose of the provision in the first instance, under both the 1977 Act and this Bill, is to enable a drain to be declared a water services authority sewer so that, in turn, any person discharging trade effluent into it would be required to obtain a discharge licence under section 63. Insertion of a reference to section 63 rather than the Act as a whole will ensure that provision for this purpose is explicitly made.Amendment No. 140 is a technical amendment, arising from amendment No. 134.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The purpose of this set of amendments is to replace references to obligations on occupiers of a premises under section 69 with references to such obligations applying to persons making or causing a discharge from a premises. A similar amendment has already been inserted into section 66 via amendments Nos. 122 and 123.Section 69 enables a water services authority to declare a drain to be a sewer for the purposes of requiring a trade effluent licence to be obtained under section 63 regarding any relevant discharge into it. It is based on similar provisions in the Water Pollution Acts, which have been repealed and consolidated in this Bill. In the course of consultations the Department has been advised that the use of the term "occupier" has on occasion caused difficulties under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977. The case of a dispute between a landlord and tenant over who was the rightful legal occupier of a premises is an example. These amendments remove any doubt in that respect and express without equivocation that the obligations under this section apply to the person who is causing the discharge concerned, regardless of any tenancy issues. The revised wording reflects the style of wording in section 63 on the requirement to apply for a licence to discharge trade effluent into a sewer in the first instance. A similar amendment to section 66 concerns associated appeals.

In page 70, subsection (1), line 23, after "unoccupied" to insert "or comprises of a rented dwelling,".It is grossly unfair to impose this burden on the tenants of a rented house. It should clearly be the duty of the landlord to ensure that this section be complied with. One simply cannot impose the responsibilities of an owner on the occupier of a rented property. Landlords have responsibility for the properties that they own, and I urge the Minister of State to accept these two amendments. It makes sense to do so and tighten up the legislation in this regard.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	153	If I agreed to accept these amendments, they would place an unreasonable obligation on the owner of a premises to ensure that the actions of a tenant conformed with the requirements under the section to avoid risk to human health and the environment from waste water discharges. It is appropriate that the liability for breach of a duty of care be placed on the perpetrator of that action rather than a third party. It would be unfair on a landlord to hold him or her responsible where, for example, a tenant discharges a noxious substance into a sewer which causes a risk to human health. Clearly, in such an instance where he or she has perpetrated the misdemeanour, the tenant should be held liable for those actions. To provide otherwise would place a landlord in an invidious position and leave him or her open to the abuse of such a provision by a tenant in the event of a tenancy dispute. The deterrent value of the Bill would be greatly reduced if the person responsible for causing the breach of a duty of care were not directly liable for his or her actions, and the duty of care provisions under section 70 would be rendered less effective as a result.As currently worded, the duties of care under section 70 regarding waste water discharges from a premises apply to the occupiers of that premises, regardless of whether they know it. To cover all situations, such duties of care extend to the owner in all instances where a premises is unoccupied. It is not considered appropriate to compromise those clear lines of responsibility by placing obligations on owners which might be difficult to enforce owing to landlord-tenant issues or because of difficulty with access. The current wording offers the most direct means of enforcement and therefore the most direct means of ensuring that human health and the environment are adequately protected.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Section 70(4) prohibits the disposal of waste water to drainage or sewerage systems which are designed solely to receive storm water. All modern drain and sewerage systems are designed on that basis. The purpose of the amendment is to avoid any problem with the enforcement of section 70(4) owing to difficulty in proving that a particular system was provided in the first instance solely for the reception of storm water, notwithstanding that it is currently used solely for that purpose. The prohibition will therefore now apply regarding pipes provided or used solely for the reception of storm water.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	157	This amendment replaces and expands the scope of the original section 70(9). The original provision enables the Minister to make regulations to prohibit or restrict the discharge of specified effluent to a sewer. The revised provision, in addition to enabling regulations to be made to prohibit or restrict the discharge of specified effluent to a sewer, will also enable regulations to specify measures to be taken before the discharge of effluent and enable such regulations to apply also to discharges to a drain, service connection or waste water works. Such regulations may be used, for example, to specify requirements regarding the installation of grease traps in food preparation outlets to reduce the load at the treatment works or prevent disruption to the waster water treatment process. Enabling the regulations to apply to discharges to a drain, service connection or waste water works is intended to avoid any problem regarding at what point in the discharge route the specific requirement may have to be undertaken. The amendment ties in with the revised definition of "drain" and "service connection" agreed earlier in section 2.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Section 72 provides for the basic authority to provide water services by meter. It enables a water services provider to supply water by meter and measure the volume or rate of discharge of water via a meter. Amendments Nos. 152 and 153 will clarify beyond doubt the intent of paragraphs (c) and (d) in subsection (1). These paragraphs enable a water services provider to require a customer to take services via a meter. It is possible that the paragraphs could be interpreted in such a manner that the obligation of the user to take water services via a meter could be satisfied if there is a meter along the route of the distribution network, for example, at the treatment plant. Such a construction would undermine the intent of the provision. To prevent doubt, these amendments enable the water services provider to require that services be taken through a specified meter, for example, on the premises of the user.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Why is the Minister of State imposing meters on connections if he does not intend to charge at a future date? A meter is there to gauge the supply of water that is delivered to particular users and the provision of meters introduces the intent of charges. It is evident from what the Minister of State has said that he intends to instruct group and regional water scheme committees and local authorities to impose meters on connections. Charges are down the road and the wool is being pulled over our eyes again. Metering is evidently envisioned in the Minister of State's speech.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The meter starts running when one enters a taxi and it is there to measure cost not just the distance travelled. There is a fear that metering will be imposed for the specific purpose of charging people for water usage. Given the fiscal situation in this country for the last few years and that many public services have been starved of funds, not least the local authorities for which contributions from the local government fund have decreased significantly, the fear is that metering will be used to charge people for water. Gathering information regarding water usage is an advantage of meters but there are alternative ways of doing this. Mention of the word "metering" lends strong credence to the idea that fees will be introduced for water services and the only purpose of metering will be to introduce costs. I am cognisant of the Minister of State's speech today and I invite him to repeat the statement that there is no Government intention to introduce charges.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I have been invited by Senator McCarthy to repeat my earlier statement and I am pleased to do so. The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997 precludes the charging of domestic users for water services. This is in line with Government policy and there is no intention to change it. Existing legislation provides for the charging of commercial users and this is well accepted by all sides of the House. This Bill does not change that and the metering provisions in section 72 are intended to support ongoing charges for non-domestic users.Metering will be universally necessary after 2006 and it makes sense. It is necessary, as Senator Brady observed, for collecting data and facilitating conservation. The amount of water that comes out of the tap after leaving the source varies across local authorities but is only approximately 50% on average. If that figure could be increased to 70% it would reduce dramatically the need to undertake further investment in many water schemes. Metering makes sense and I repeat as unambiguously as possible that there is no intention to introduce domestic water charges. Consumers will be happy to know the quantity of water usage and that wastage can be detected. As I have pointed out today and during last week's Committee Stage debate, the amount of water wasted is frightening.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I agree the extent of water wastage is frightening. We all know from group, council and public water schemes that much water is being lost and leaked for various reasons. However, there must be some logic behind the introduction of metering and the logic of charging is one of the first that comes to mind. The Minister of State observes that water for commercial use will be metered and charged but many schools and other community-based facilities will face water charges also. I am aware of several schools which are finding it difficult to raise the substantial funds required to pay for metered water through various schemes, whether public, private or group. This is more like domestic than commercial usage because if the pupils are not using the water at home they are using it at school and vice versa. Grants should be provided to schools, which are being metered.If the ground rule is being established that all water will be metered there must be a logic as to why. I presume it is certainly not for the sake having a meter. A meter is of no benefit unless it is read and if the meters are read there will surely be a certain quantity of water prescribed per household. The figure of 50,000 gallons per annum is the one that has been taken for group and public water schemes for the last few years as the amount allowable for the grants that are being paid. There must be an apparatus for reading the meters that are being established and if people exceed the amount that has been prescribed over the last several years, will there be a charge even for domestic users? That is the issue. The other issue concerns the water usage of schools and community facilities. We can take it that it is not commercial because secondary schools are not getting cash for it, but they have to collect and pay for it.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	168	This Bill does not deal with charges. Even if I were inclined to respond positively to the Senator's suggestion that schools should be exempt, it is not the appropriate Bill. There is no mechanism in this legislation to deal with that. Perhaps I did not clarify this sufficiently in my first response. I want to make it clear that metering will be for non-domestic users. There is no intention of metering for domestic users, who are exempt. If the water services authority, however, was of the opinion that water was being wasted by someone through the domestic system, it would be possible to meter that. This would not be to meter consumption for the purpose of charging, but to establish if water was being wasted. I am glad of the opportunity to clarify that.The national water services public policy framework requires all local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes only. This is in accordance with the appropriate application of the "polluter pays" principle and the requirement of article 9 of the EU waste water directive. This framework does not provide for the exemption of specific classes of non-domestic users, including those engaged in the provision of educational or hospital services, from the charging policy. It would be regarded as inequitable to single out one sector and would lead, in any event, to great administrative difficulties, adjudicating the rights to exemption of one institution or sector from another. Exemption from charges would hide the true cost of service provision. This could be particularly problematic in the event of private and public sector institutions operating in the same sector, where balance and transparency would need to be maintained in the interest of equal treatment. I am not inclined to consider particular institutions, but if I was this would not be the appropriate Bill. It does not deal with water charges.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I am somewhat concerned at the Minister of State's comments. I wonder whether he has checked with all local authorities. Some local authorities are insisting that meters be installed on all newly constructed group water schemes. I understand also there is a directive from the Department in this regard before grants are drawn down. I would like greater clarity on this because meters are being installed on all new group water schemes. I have been involved in a number of group water schemes in recent times and this is the case. I agree with my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, as regards schools and sporting facilities. Domestic water charges are being imposed on schools throughout the country by local authorities. They are illegal and if a court challenge was taken they would be found to be so. After all, schoolchildren are taking the equivalent of domestic supply from the system. They would use the same amount of water if they were at home on a given day. The same is true of sporting facilities. People use the water to drink, shower and wash themselves after partaking in a sport, which we should be encouraging, not discouraging by imposing charges on voluntary bodies such as clubs. I ask the Minister of State to examine this as a matter of urgency. We are always talking about trying to get people to participate in recreational facilities, which should be encouraged. Most of those facilities are operated on a voluntary, parish basis, particularly GAA clubs throughout the country. There is one in every parish and they find it hard enough to survive without the imposition of water charges. Perhaps the Minister and the Minister of State could examine this. If a challenge is taken, as will shortly happen, it will not stand up. After all it is the domestic water supply they are using.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I am merely repeating what I said to Senator Paddy Burke. There is no opportunity in the Water Services Bill 2003 to allow me, the Government or the Opposition to introduce an amendment to exempt the institutions mentioned by the Senator from water charges. Absolutely nothing can be done. Lest I am giving the wrong impression, there is no intention to do that. In my earlier contribution I referred to the equity of the legislation. If the Government was to intervene in group water schemes, that would be seen to interfere with private schemes. The group water schemes are very much the responsibility of the trustees and their members. If they decide to put in meters, that is a matter for them, but I am not aware that is the case. I am not even anxious to pursue it because I do not want to interfere. Of course a bulk meter would make much sense so the trustees and members of the scheme could have the relevant data regarding the amount of water being used in a daily, weekly or monthly period. It would make sense if bulk meters were installed. However, there is no obligation now or on the enactment of this Bill, by way of regulation or otherwise, to insist on meters either on public or group water schemes. That is a matter for the group water schemes, but I am not aware of any of these.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I move amendment No. 154:
In page 72, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:"(2) Meters or the data taken or read from them shall not be used for the purpose of calculating or imposing a charge on the end user.".I am proposing this amendment because it is clear the Minister intends to introduce metering and charging for water. This is evident and the Minister of State did not clarify the position as regards group water schemes. Conditions are laid down for committees so all domestic and agricultural connections must be metered. That is one of the conditions imposed before they can draw down a grant. It is important we get clarity on that because I know of schemes that have suffered consequences on being told meters had to be installed on particular schemes. A certain percentage of the grant was withheld until such time as the meters were installed. A large number of such schemes have meters installed on the basis of conditions being set for the committees to abide by. We need more clarity in that regard.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	172	As far as agriculture is concerned, Senator Bannon is quite right. Agriculture is non-domestic and users pay a water charge. There is no demand by the rural water section of my Department, and no instruction has gone out, to ensure that group water schemes or the individuals in such schemes are metered. I am quite definite about that.I cannot accept this amendment. It has as its basis the misconception that the Bill provides for or facilitates the introduction of domestic water charges. I can only reiterate that it does not. Such a provision is not considered appropriate. It is not necessary to reiterate the Government's water pricing policy, which is based on an equitable share of the cost of water servicing being borne by non-domestic users, subject to there being no cross-subsidisation by that sector on domestic users. I regret I am unable to accept the amendment.

The volume of water used may be affected by other factors such as leakage or illegal connections which are beyond the point of metering. In the circumstances the word "supplied" reflects more accurately the purpose of metering, which is to measure the volume of water supplied by a water services provider.

In page 75, subsection (1), line 11, after "as" to insert "an Coiste Náisiúnta Seirbhísí Uisce Tuathúil or, in the English language,".The amendment seeks to insert the Irish title of the committee. This issue arose recently during our discussions of the An Bord Bia Bill when the Minister for Agriculture and Food, while accepting the spirit of an amendment tabled by me, was, for various reasons best known to himself, unwilling to accept it. The situation which arises now is different in that the Minister of State has tabled an alternative amendment.While I accept the similarities of the two amendments, perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on his amendment. It is obvious he intends to include the Irish and English titles of the committee in the Bill.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I thank Senator McCarthy for tabling his amendment. I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that Senators are correct in that the Irish title of the National Rural Services Committee should be included in the Bill. However, as we are discussing the English language version of the Bill, as is practice, the committee will be known by the English version of its name as is the case since its establishment on a non-statutory basis in 1998. It is preferable in the circumstances that the English title of the committee appear in the text before the Irish title.Accordingly, I ask Senators to accept amendment No. 157 which provides that the English language version of the title of the committee be included in the Bill followed by the Irish language version and to withdraw amendment No. 156.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Section 79 requires all water service providers other than a water services authority or its agent to be licensed subject to such classes of exception as the Minister may prescribe. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the introduction of modern design-build-operate procurement arrangements to the rural water sector will not cause confusion as to whether the contractor or contracting group water services scheme require to be licensed under this section.It provides in effect for the avoidance of doubt that, notwithstanding the engagement of a contractor to provide water services on behalf of a group water services scheme, responsibility for delivery of the service in accordance with the prescribed standards remains with the scheme which shall, in turn, require to be licensed. The effect of the amendment will be to put beyond doubt that it is the responsibility of the group water services scheme rather than its contracted agent to obtain a licence to provide water services notwithstanding that they may be delivered by another person on their behalf under contract. It will be a matter for each group water services scheme to ensure that contract conditions are adequate to protect its interests in this regard.Design-build-operate and bundling of individual schemes in the group scheme sector are currently being employed in many instances to put in place the maximum number of treatment plants in the shortest possible timeframe at optimum cost and effectiveness. Accordingly, it is prudent to clarify that it is a group water services scheme that requires a licence and not the contractor.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	179	This amendment replaces and expands the original section 92 to enable water services authority powers of direction in relation to connections to be applied not just to group water services schemes, but to individual water service consumers. It also provides for additional appeals provisions and introduces new provisions on future maintenance arrangements on shared connections to services.The revised provision enables a water services authority to direct any person who is already connected to its water services to facilitate extension of those services to another person through his or her pipes. Similar directions may be made to facilitate connection of other persons premises to water storage facilities or related drains. As soon as a notice becomes enforceable, the water services authority is enabled to enter land and carry out the necessary works for this purpose. The cost of related works must be borne by the water services authority or the beneficiary of the connection in such proportion as the water services authority may decide.In the interests of fairness, the powers of direction will not be applicable where they interfere unreasonably with the capacity of the notice recipient to carry on a business which is connected to the services in question. It is envisaged that the District Court could adjudicate on this matter in the context of an appeal for which provision is duly made. Responsibility for ongoing maintenance and renewal of a pipe into which a connection is made will remain with the owner of the pipe who may apportion any cost between themselves and the beneficiary of the new connection in proportion to the respective level of use of the pipe. Disputes about the apportionment of subsequent maintenance costs, or about compensation arising from an initial connection, will be referred to arbitration rather than to the courts to minimise delays in the appeals process.The enforcement of a direction under this section will be done by means of a District Court injunction, as required. The revised powers of direction continue to enable a water services authority to require an unauthorised provider of water services to facilitate connection through its water works or waste water works. The provision of services by the water services authority will facilitate the orderly development of water services, in accordance with relevant strategic plans and in line with the intention of the original section 92.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Will the water services authority be financed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government? Will it have to raise its own funds? Will it have to raise money by charging for water services? I ask the Minister of State to elaborate. I am somewhat concerned that it will impose charges if it wants funding. It is unrealistic that the groups availing of the authority's services will be asked to pay if it does not receive back-up funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or another body. I ask the Minister of State to clarify where the authority's funding will come from. I am concerned that it will be allowed to impose significant charges on the users of its services if it needs additional funding.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I am somewhat confused and I ask the Senator to clarify his question. No charges will be imposed on non-domestic users. Perhaps the Senator is referring to works or maintenance to be carried out. I do not understand his question. If he repeats it, I will try to answer it.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	182	How will the water services authority be funded? It is a simple question.

The Senator is aware that the Government has substantially increased allocations to local authorities in recent years. An important part of the authority's income will come from charges for non-domestic use.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Minister of State is probably aware that there are huge shortfalls in funding to various local authorities throughout the country. Nine sewerage schemes for County Longford which have been approved are waiting for funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is a small county with a population of just 31,000 people. A further six or seven schemes have been delayed at the planning stage. Approximately six towns and villages in County Longford have sewerage services. It is evident that there is a significant shortfall in funding. How will the schemes be funded? The proposed schemes at Ardagh, Abbeylara and Ballinalee were approved six years ago, but we are still waiting for funding for their construction. The example I have given relates to a small county, but it is typical of many local authority areas throughout the country.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Is Senator Bannon talking about capital or current funding? I am proud of the Government's commitment to the development programme between 2000 and 2006. It has invested €4.4 billion in water schemes throughout the country. I am certain that the six schemes to which the Senator referred have not been delayed because of shortfalls in funding. Senators are aware that schemes have to pass through various stages after they have been approved in principle. It may be the case that the schemes in question have not yet reached the final stage, which is the appointment of a contractor. We are familiar with the preliminary reports. Perhaps there is a misconception among the public. People may believe that a scheme is ready to start after permission has been given by the Department to proceed with a preliminary report, but it does not happen like that. There are many plans. I am sure that sufficient funds have been made available, under the programme between 2000 and 2006, for the completion of every scheme that has been brought to the stage at which it is ready to commence.The Senator may have been asking about current costs and shortfalls in local authorities. The Government can be proud of its record in that regard. I refer to the increase in the local government fund, especially since 1997. I will not go into the details of that. It is for another day. The substantial increases are in sharp contrast with the type of funding that was made available pre-1997.

Local authorities imposed development charges before their most recent AGMs and in the run-up to their last finance meetings. Members of the Minister of State's party throughout the country are angry about the imposition of the development charges, which were intended as a means of making up for the shortfall in local authority funding. The Minister of State's party suffered the consequences at the local elections more than it did at the European elections. That has been stressed by members of Fianna Fáil to whom I have spoken in County Longford, where it lost three seats, and in several other counties.

It was a matter of streamlining them. The Government has not insisted on any development charges. Members can decide whether they want development charges. Senator Bannon knows, just as I do, that there is a multiplier effect if counties have additional development charges. It helps them, in no small way, to draw down additional funding. It is not an imposition on the part of the Government. Development charges have always been there. Members throughout the country took their own decisions. Some of them maintained the status quo and others increased development charges, which was in the best interests of the various local authorities.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	190	This technical amendment removes a possible ambiguity from the text of the Bill. The current wording of section 93(1) provides that the extension to water service authorities of the powers under section 182 and Part XIV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is only, in effect, for the purpose of acquiring land. While Part XIV of the 2000 Act deals specifically with the acquisition of land, section 182 of the Act does not provide for the acquisition of land per se. Instead, it enables local authorities to run water pipes, sewers and drains across land. In the circumstances, that may lead to interpretation difficulties. The purpose of this amendment, which proposes to delete the words “for that purpose”, is to remove the link in section 93(1) between section 182 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the acquisition of land. Section 93(1) will now provide for the basic authority of a water services authority to acquire land. For the avoidance of doubt, the powers of section 182 and Part XIV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 will apply to a water services authority.

In page 87, subsection (1), line 41, after "arbitrator" to insert "whose decision shall be binding".What is the point of engaging an arbitrator if his or her decision will not be binding? We need to make it clear in the Bill that the decision of the arbitrator will be binding on all parties. That would be a necessary improvement and perhaps the Minister of State would consider accepting the amendment.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The proposed amendment to insert a provision in section 96 to the effect that the determination of compensation by a duly appointed arbitrator in regard to compulsory acquisition of a waterworks or waste water works shall be binding is unnecessary as such provision is already included in the relevant legislation governing the appointment of arbitrators. The purpose of section 96 is to itemise the relevant grounds that an arbitrator must have regard to when assessing an appropriate amount of compensation in a particular case. The introduction of a reference to binding arbitration detracts from the main objective of the section. This provision is already included in the relevant legislation which governs the appointment of arbitrators.

In page 89, subsection (1), line 24, to delete "The" and substitute "In circumstances of emergency, the".I oppose this section because it paves the way for the privatisation of Ireland's water supply. We are debating Committee Stage but in all likelihood the Bill——
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	196	We are discussing amendment No. 166, to delete "The" and substitute "In circumstances of emergency".
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Yes, but I also oppose the section and I wanted the opportunity to outline my reasons for that. This section paves the way for the privatisation of the water supply, and it may be used as a vehicle to introduce water charges. Section 99 effectively confers power on the Minister to amend provisions in this Bill to enable the introduction of charges. We have a major difficulty with that because it goes against the idea of the role of Members of this House. We are here to improve legislation etc., and if we permit this section to remain in the Bill, we will need to make it clear that it can only be used in exceptional circumstances. That is the reason the words "in circumstances of emergency" should be inserted in this section. It is difficult to speak to the amendment when I am opposing the section but perhaps the Minister of State would consider changing the section because I am not happy with it.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	198	It is necessary to first outline the general background to the section in order to set the context in which it has come about. The purpose of section 99 is to ensure that the legislation is not at any stage an impediment to the implementation of responses to situations of an emergency nature affecting the national interest. Such provision may be needed from time to time, for example, in situations such as those that arose in the foot and mouth disease crisis some years ago when statutory obligations to carry out certain monitoring or inspection functions may be contrary to the national interest in containing the spread of disease by minimising the instance of entry onto land.It is envisaged that the provisions of section 99 would only be used in rare and exceptional circumstances which resulted in the Houses of the Oireachtas being sufficiently concerned to bring an order on this section into effect in the first instance. The procedures under the section are fully transparent and allow for maximum possible accountability via the Houses of the Oireachtas before an order is made. To this end, subsection (3) provides that a draft order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the order shall not be made until each House has passed a resolution to approve it. The process proposed, therefore, subjects every order to full, due democratic process before it is made.On amendment No. 166, I am concerned that the addition of a specific reference to an emergency in section 99 may, in the absence of a definition of what constitutes an emergency, cause unnecessary difficulties with the application of the section. It is essential that sufficient flexibility be available to enable the Oireachtas, not the Minister, to respond as appropriate and necessary in all circumstances. Furthermore, if the word "emergency" proposed by Deputy Bannon was to be defined, the application of the section may be restricted and hampered subsequently by a dispute as to whether a particular incident came within the scope of the section.On the other hand, in the absence of such a reference it will be a matter for each House of the Oireachtas to adjudicate on the merits of any particular situation giving rise to a draft order under this section. Each House will be fully aware on a case by case basis of the gravity of the situation leading to the submission by the Minister of a draft order for approval. It is unnecessary to confine the scope of their deliberations by the insertion of an additional wording proposed in amendment No. 166.That being said, it is useful to set out the general context in which the powers in this section may be applied. Amendment No. 167, therefore, provides that the purposes for which an order may be made under section 90 are for the prevention of risk to public health and the protection of the environment. The amendment inserts an unambiguous objective into the section the fulfilment of which will, as occasion demands, give rise to its application.It is envisaged that the necessity to apply this section will be decided on a case by case basis. There will be no question of looking for blanket approval and it will be subject to the approval of both Houses. The insertion of amendment No. 167 will guide the deliberations of the Oireachtas as to whether the content of an order is appropriate in a given circumstance. It is a necessary but sufficient addition to subsection (1) without the need for further provision limiting the circumstances in which the section may be applied. On the basis of what I have outlined, and in the light of amendment No. 167, I respectfully suggest to Senator Bannon that he might reconsider amendment No. 167 and his opposition to the section. The term "emergency" must be left vague because, if defined, it would limit the scope of the Bill's application, leaving the legislation open to challenge. The Oireachtas makes decisions on the basis of the Minister's recommendations as power ultimately rests with it. Power resting solely with the Minister will only happen in exceptional circumstances, such as the foot and mouth disease outbreak.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	199	This section states that legislation enacted before 1922 which may come into conflict with the Bill shall no longer have effect. Will the Minister of State inform the House what pre-1922 Acts could affect this Bill? Why is such a blind application being made in this case, as it could have unforeseen consequences? I understand the statute law revision unit of the Office of the Attorney General has conducted an audit of those pre-1922 statutes which might conflict with this Bill. As the correct approach would be to repeal directly the individual enactments, I oppose this section.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Section 100 provides that a provision of a pre-1922 statute will no longer have force of law where its application could frustrate the application of this Bill. Given the number, diversity and, in some cases, obscurity of pre-1922 legislation dating back to the middle of the 19th century, it is not possible to identify every individual element of the water services legislative code, despite thorough research by Department officials. Section 100 removes any possibility of remaining legislative provisions on the Statute Book which, if discovered at a later date, could be used to undermine the application of this Bill. Such an action would also undermine the wishes of the Oireachtas to provide up-to-date and appropriate regulations of the provision of water services. The Water Services Bill is intended to be the central and primary legislation for water services. It would be inappropriate if some unknown provision and obscure legislation could be resurrected at a later stage to interfere with this purpose, or attempt to impose 18th or 19th century legal provisions on a 21st century service. The repeal schedule confirms the extent of the efforts, through detailed research by Department officials, to unearth old legislation affecting water services. It is possible that obscure local Acts remain extant despite attempts to trace them. This section is a necessary safety valve to prevent a subsequent unearthing of such an Act being used to derail the Bill.In accordance with the Government White Paper on Better Regulation, the Attorney General has undertaken a comprehensive review of the stock of legislation which pre-dates the establishment of the State. As a first step, the statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General has carried out a stocktaking exercise to determine how many Acts from the various parliaments that administered Ireland between 1235 and 1922, almost 700 years, remain in force. So far, approximately 500 Acts have been discovered to be still in force from this period. A consultation process with Departments is underway to repeal or incorporate these provisions into the current Statute Book. This will help the Government to modernise pre-Independence laws and make Statute Law more coherent and accessible. Section 100 complements this process and will ensure the Water Services Bill is not undermined pending the completion of this review.Although thorough research has been carried out, section 100 draws a line in the sand to ensure dormant laws do not affect the future application of the Bill. No other reason, devious or otherwise, is behind it and I recommend it to the House.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	202	This amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 enables the Minister to make regulations governing appeals to An Bord Pleanála under the Act in respect of decisions by a local authority on the licensing of trade effluent or sewerage discharges to waters under section 4. Section 6 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 already provides for making regulations for licensing under section 4 and appeals under section 8 but does not contain explicit provisions for oral hearings and appeals procedures. The additional provisions enable regulations to be made for procedural matters for appeals, such as public notification requirements, time limits for the holding of oral hearings of an appeal, the conduct of oral hearing by a person appointed by the board or other related matters. Such provisions will bring the 1977 Act into line with provisions under section 67 of the Water Services Bill 2003 for appeals to An Bord Pleanála on the licensing of trade effluent discharges to sewers. It will facilitate streamlining and standardisation of respective legislative codes for ease of access and application.

These amendments insert reference to the previous 1990 amendment Act into relevant provisions in order to avoid any doubt that the earlier increases are now overtaken by the provisions of section 104.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	209	This group of amendments adds section 15 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878 to the list of repeals and also provides for the repeal of paragraph 1 of section 29 of that Act. Section 15 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act of 1878 provided in effect that all existing and future sewers and related waste water works in the functional area of a sanitary authority would vest in and be under the control of the sanitary authority. Its functions with regard to existing sewers have been fulfilled and will continue to apply by means of the Interpretation Acts. Its continuing application to all sewers provided in the future could serve to undermine the development of public private partnership projects or the undertaking by group water service schemes of waste water collection and treatment functions. Where a group water service scheme provides a sewer, for example, it is intended that it would normally remain in the ownership of the scheme which would in due course be responsible for its ongoing maintenance subject to the conditions of its licence under Part 6 to provide waste water service. It is appropriate therefore that section 15 should be repealed.The repeal of section 29(1) of the 1878 Act is consequential on amendment No. 170 which inserted a new section 103 with regard to the control of building over pipes. Section 29 provides for penalties for unauthorised building over urban authority sewers together with related powers to alter, demolish or otherwise deal with such structures and recover costs incurred. It is being replaced by the provision of the new section. Section 29 is not being entirely repealed as it also deals with controls on building vaults and cellars under streets.

Such good work for the public good must continue, which is exactly the intention of the Bill. There is, of course, always more that could be done. In this context, the increase of €30 million in the amount the current board may spend on programmes and projects, as announced last week, is timely and significant. The Government's decision on the issue is in response to a request from the board for increased funding and informed by the fact that there were no approvals for funding made by the board last year. It was around Christmas time that it got up and running and made its first allocations.

This will remain unchanged. There has been considerable public debate as to the purpose and impact of the Bill. There are compelling reasons, both in terms of governance and public policy, as to why legislation is necessary at this time.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Bad polls.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	234	However, there is currently no legal provision for a proper organisational structure for the board. The law essentially provides for an ad hoc arrangement for the secondment of staff from the Department. Having regard to the emerging scale of the fund, and the independence of the board, such an arrangement is not tenable. Under current arrangements, the chairperson of the board is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the board’s decisions on the use of moneys from the dormant accounts fund. It is not appropriate to require a part-time chairperson to assume responsibility for disbursement decisions for a potential spend of €200 million, or possibly more in the future. Current arrangements are fundamentally deficient, both in terms of governance structures and organisational arrangements. Questions also arise from a public policy point of view. If we are serious about tackling severe disadvantage, the State must use all resources available to it for this purpose in a particularly focused and sustained approach. It is doubtful if current arrangements can secure optimal impact in this regard.Given the issues outlined, it has been argued that a new organisation should be established to provide the board with a permanent administrative support structure. However, the facts argue against this. First, such an organisation would dissipate significant dormant accounts funds on administration costs. Second, this option ignores the inherent finite nature of the fund. Third, and crucially, such an arrangement would bypass the expertise and knowledge within public bodies in regard to disadvantage and disability. I wish people would listen to and read these key and important reasons rather than coming up with soundbites.A more sensible approach, which underlines the Bill, is to draw on the expertise, knowledge and resources of existing public bodies. We must be careful about using correctly taxpayers' money. There is no point setting up another body to work through these issues if we already have knowledge and expertise within existing public bodies.

For this reason, the Government has decided against setting up a new organisation. Instead, the Bill provides that the Government will in future decide on disbursements from the fund, but following a public application process and within a framework of transparency and process set out in law.The Government is committed to ensuring that the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursments Board is enabled to fulfil its role as independent planner and as critical appraiser. Reflecting this, the Bill proposes that the board will retain its responsibilities to develop a plan for disbursements of moneys from the fund and that it will review and assess the extent to which the objects of the plan have been achieved and the effectiveness of its strategies. Critically, the board is also being conferred with a new power to report on the additionality of disbursements. In this way, critical analysis of the impact of such spending on the ground will be placed on a statutory independent footing.Given these responsibilities, it is clear that the board will have a vital role in influencing the strategies for disbursements from the fund, and in assessing the additionality and impact of spend.

Concerns have been raised as to the extent to which the changes in this regard may adversely affect the focus and impact of spending from the fund. Recognising this, the Government has provided for a range of measures in the Bill to secure transparency and accessibility. As already indicated, the existing objectives of disbursements from the fund and the current plan are being retained. This ensures the focus of the spend. However, two critical further measures are provided for in the Bill — a new requirement to publicise and invite applications for funding and a further requirement to publish lists of all successful applications and the amounts involved.In practice, this means that each year, following broad Government approval of programmes and types of projects for funding, applications will be publicly invited for eligible programmes or projects. Following evaluation of such applications by, or on behalf of, public bodies, the Government will approve a range of specific measures and projects.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	251	These rigorous and extensive measures confirm the Government's absolute commitment to ensure that decisions on the fund are informed by the public interest, accessible to public application and fully subject to public scrutiny. These are the important criteria.I should also mention that the Bill provides for separate recording of dormant accounts spending through the Votes of Departments. This means, for example, that where dormant accounts fund spending for a project for a community group is approved, the relevant funding will be channelled through the Department principally dealing with that sectoral group. In this way, dormant accounts spending can be tracked across Departments and transparency as to overall spend and accountability is enhanced.At this point I, on behalf of the Government, wish to convey the Government's appreciation to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for the work it has undertaken to date.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	253	Following its establishment in June 2002, the board developed a draft disbursements plan that established the framework within which disbursements from the fund would be approved. Since December 2003, the disbursements board has approved 58 projects to the tune of €6.4 million. Money from the fund is being spent on a wide range of projects and activities across diverse geographical areas, but with one essential common thread, namely the alleviation of disadvantage. In accordance with the plan, priority funding is earmarked far RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas, which cover the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas in the country. The Government is fully committed to continuing this work. Recognising the work undertaken and progress made by the existing board, the Bill provides for the reappointment of its members to the new board.The more detailed technical provisions of the legislation are set out in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the text of the Bill. I have already spoken about some of the key areas but I now propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill.Sections 1 to 5 are standard provisions relating to definitions, establishment day, interpretation and suchlike. Section 6 amends the principal Act in relation to the section on penalties and proceedings, consequent on the removal of the provision in the principal Act on unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.Section 7 provides for a new Part 5 of the principal Act. With the exception of section 31, the other sections in Part 5 substantially reflect the existing provisions in the principal Act. Section 31 provides that the new Dormant Accounts Board will prepare a disbursements plan and submit it to the Minister and review, assess and report to the Minister on the pattern, impact and additionality of spending from the fund and the effectiveness of the strategies in the plan.Board membership, including the chairperson, is increased from nine to 11, with a corresponding increase in the quorum for meetings from five to six.

All existing disbursement board members are eligible for re-appointment to the new board. The terms of office of board members are set at a maximum of five years for the chairperson and three years for other members. Other provisions relating to conditions of office, filling of casual vacancies, meetings and procedure, membership of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament, or local authorities, and disclosure of interest remain as they were for the former board.The Bill provides in section 8, the new Part 6, for two stages in the process whereby the Government will make decisions on spending from the fund. First, provision is made in Part 6, section 42, for the preparation and submission for the Minister's approval not later than 1 June 2006 of the new board's plan for disbursement of moneys from the fund. Section 43 provides that the Minister, having consulted with other Ministers, shall, not less than once each year, make a proposal to the Government concerning the programmes or types of projects in relation to which applications for funding should be invited.

Subsequent to Government approval of the proposal, the Minister, following a public process of invitations for applications, will recommend for funding a list of programmes or projects that have been assessed by, or on behalf of, public bodies. In addition to this process, and as previously provided for under the principal Act, the Government has discretion to approve funding for additional programmes that comply with the core purposes of the fund. All decisions made under either of these processes will be detailed in a statement to be laid before the Oireachtas and publicised, with the disbursements routed to successful applicants through Departments.Section 9 provides that the National Treasury Management Agency will report annually on the operation of the fund to the Minister for Finance, and the board will report annually to the Minister, who will lay copies before the Oireachtas.

The chairperson of the former board will remain accountable to the committee in respect of decisions of that board. The new board will have power to instruct the National Treasury Management Agency to make disbursements on foot of decisions made by the former board which have not been paid out on establishment of the new board, and the chairperson of the new board will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of those decisions.Sections 13 to 15 make standard provisions regarding transfer of assets, liabilities and contracts to the new board, takeover of contracts and agreements and substitution of the name of the new board in any legal proceedings. It will remain the purpose of spending from the dormant accounts fund to assist persons who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged, and persons with a disability. This was and remains the original core function.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has responsibility for the technical aspect of the Bill. However, I wished to convey my desire to have the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, in the House. The Minister needs to be present so he can see what is happening because his ministerial colleagues are taking a hand off him. I accept the Minister talks the talk and I record my admiration for what he says and his intentions for the west, disadvantaged areas and, if I may be parochial, CLÁR areas of County Donegal. However, when the Minister began talking the talk, I had serious reservations about how he would finance his broadband projects, road, sewerage and water programmes and general targets for disadvantaged areas. Up to one year ago, I believed the Department of Community and Gaeltacht Affairs was nothing more than a bridesmaid ministerial post.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	265	It still is.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I felt it did not have the teeth because it did not have the resources. However, things change. The Government, including the Progressive Democrats, did not do its homework when it forgot that dormant accounts could be a significant resource — some would call it a significant slush fund. However, it became obvious this was likely to be a significant resource. Deputy Ó Cuív's ministerial colleagues realised they were dealing with a budget of €60 million for 2004, which might increase to at least €225 million and perhaps €250 million in three years, as the Minister of State noted. Figures available to me suggest it could go to €500 million in three years. Ministers who were under pressure at Cabinet due to promises made at the last general election decided they wanted to get their paws on the money. This is why I wanted the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, present in the House for this debate. He is a competent and confident Minister and I am surprised his Cabinet colleagues are taking a hand at him. However, I am sure he will get the message in the short term.The other reason I wanted to speak in this debate was to emphasise the importance of this issue and the outrageousness of the legislation. The Bill undermines the confidence of the community and voluntary sector and the relationship built up in regard to ADM Limited since 1992. The Bill should not be before the House. A body was set up and was working in this area. Why redesign the wheel when it is not broken? If it is a question of resources, why not employ the extra staff dotted throughout the country who could do with extra work? The Minister of State has already stated that, at some stage, additional staff may be required under the new mechanism. Why not do this under the current mechanism? The removal of representation from ADM Limited is the first part of the process to undermine the healthy work which has been ongoing. That representation linked the community and voluntary sector with the political sector.The significance of the current situation lies in the timing of this legislation, which is being dealt with in late June and early July. The Minister of State knows that those involved in the community and voluntary sector carry out the majority of their administration work in the winter. However, most of the sector's programmes take place over the summer, whether out of school hours programmes for children in June, July and August, community youth work, or working and engaging with the community. The implementation programme is carried out during the summer. To introduce the Bill at this time is to set a dangerous precedent and there will be a backlash from the community and voluntary sector, which is unprepared for the legislation.I am totally opposed to the Bill. There has been a lack of communication and consultation and the community and voluntary sector is not aware of what is going on. It is politicising a fund which could have been earmarked for the community and voluntary sector. It could have been decided by the independent and transparent forum which was already set up. However, that forum is being replaced by a similar board, although the ultimate responsibility for decision making will not lie with ADM but with Department officials and Ministers.The primary legislation was good and had the confidence of the community and voluntary sector. There is absolutely no reason to move the goalposts. ADM was a transparent and representative body, and publicly accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts. In regard to funding and accounting procedures, the existing dormant accounts board employed a consultancy company to make sure everything was above board. It was serious about its business. While there may have been a question regarding resources and a lack of qualified staff to appraise different applications, all that was required was the employment of extra staff, which should not have been difficult.That was the situation in regard to the primary legislation. However, a highly politicised appraisal body has now been set up, which no longer deals simply with dormant accounts but which is broken into four or five different mechanisms. I accept there will be an open, advertised application process which can be accessed online. That is not a problem. The next stage is the assessment, when civil servants begin working in liaison with their bosses, the Ministers. The second appraisal stage begins when the results are reported to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and his Department. There is a third appraisal stage when the results return for Government approval at Cabinet level. The Minister constantly talks about the need to get rid of bureaucracy and the legislative barriers to getting work done.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	268	In one go, the Minister has completely contradicted his philosophy on the appraisal of projects. He has introduced three different stages. At the first stage, the proposal goes to the public bodies and public officers and civil servants discuss it with their Ministers. The Ministers decide that the project will be considered. Then it goes back to Deputy Ó Cuív's table and he and his staff decide which projects to pick. The project then goes on to the third stage, when it comes before the Cabinet. Lobbying takes place and all the Deputies in different parts of the constituency and the country put on the pressure and decide, ultimately, where the €500 million will go.This is a politicised, non-transparent system that is tantamount to a political slush fund. A dagger has been put in the back of the community and voluntary sector, which has been working well with this Government. I commend where commendation is due. The community and voluntary sector has worked well. It fought hard for its rights. When it all comes out in the wash, however, its members will not be happy.There was mention of consultants, advisers and support staff in this legislation. Why were these provisions not introduced in the primary legislation when we had the existing dormant accounts disbursement board? It is a bad day for the community sector. There is no specific provision for consultation in the amendment Bill. For people working in the community sector, the major issues were a lack of transparency, communication and consultation. We need some form of consultation with the community sector. There is no feedback mechanism or communication mechanism and there is no appraisal system that involves the community and voluntary sector.There will be a complete duplication of mainstream funding. That is clear from the Minister of State's contribution. He stated that the dormant accounts fund would assist "persons who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged, and persons with a disability." That could mean anything. There are areas which merit consideration and discussion, but this statement could cover anything. Senator Brady has always highlighted the problem of drug abuse and the resources that are needed in this area. Under the existing primary legislation, the dormant accounts fund was to provide resources for this, along with funds for CLÁR and RAPID areas. Senator Brady cannot contradict me on this. This is the existing focus of the dormant accounts disbursement board. That will no longer be the case. The Minister of State knows this.The rural social scheme for small farmers was given another €10 million from the dormant accounts fund. The money for this scheme should come from mainstream channels, not from an account which could be used to aid the disadvantaged — to provide broadband in Sligo, west Galway or Kerry, or physical infrastructure.

This Bill should be thrown out because it is a embarrassment to the community and voluntary sector. It is outrageous, politicised legislation. I propose the Bill be scrapped.

He rightly states that this legislation falls within his remit. I will go a step further and state that I have always been very impressed by the Minister of State and the way in which he has handled his portfolio. He has come before the Oireachtas committee on which I sit on a number of occasions, providing the opportunity for a good question and answer session. It was always evident to me that he had a good grasp of his role and a hands-on approach. Anybody who heard him speaking about the drugs task forces will admit not only that there are few people who have such an intimate knowledge of the subject, but that he is particularly proactive in the community.It is only right that I reply to the comments of my friend Senator McHugh about the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. I have a high regard for the Minister and I have said so in the House several times. I was glad to hear Senator McHugh giving him some much deserved praise. Although rural Ireland is his forte, he has also proved himself in the area of community work. Any time I have been in his company — recently in Sligo, and in many other parts of the country as well — I have found that people appreciate how in touch with them he is. He listens to them closely. This is important not only in the enactment of legislation but also in its implementation.When dormant accounts were first discovered, the priority was to ensure that the big financial institutions would not benefit from the money — which did happen — but that it would go to people who were deprived. The Minister of State referred to those who are socially, educationally and economically deprived as well as people with disabilities. I would have been sad if the money were used for other projects because I felt these people were entitled to such consideration. We all talk about the Celtic tiger and the major economic progress that has been made in the country, but no matter what progress is made there will always be categories of people who seem to fall between the cracks. This money was ideal for use in this regard.So far, I have heard very little criticism of how the money has been used. I would be disappointed if it were ever suggested that under those categories the money was used in the wrong manner. I could not imagine that happening. I do not see anything wrong with public representatives — Deputies, Senators, or local authority members — making representations, because they are at the coalface.

In that context it is right that this legislation is not setting up a super body, not bringing in full-time chairmen and full-time staff. Nor is it establishing a new corporate body. To do that would almost certainly result in the money not going where it should.Linking this with existing Departments makes sense, not merely because the personnel is there, which is important, but because there is a huge base of knowledge within those Departments which is gleaned by virtue of their own particular roles. This makes it easy for a Department to link a case with an area in which it is working. In addition, we as Oireachtas Members in this Chamber or in the Dáil have the opportunity to inquire into the work of the Departments. I am disappointed by the suggestion, although I am sure it was not intended in this way but was probably intended to bolster another argument, that somehow the civil servants would not do a good job. I have said before that we have the best public servants in the world and we have seen that over and over again.

What is important is that the board exists. The Minister of State has already not only expressed his gratitude but has pointed out that there is provision within the legislation for the members of this board to be appointed to the newly reconstituted board as well.

I would much prefer to see it going into the dormant accounts fund than resting in any of the financial institutions which have not always covered themselves in glory when it came to the interests of the community. If there is that amount of money, there is all the more reason to stabilise and structure it, and for having a more accountable process. I believe there will be a more accountable process. I do not see how any board which is not composed of full-time members, which is not served by full-time officials and which does not have a full-time chairman can possibly handle €500 million. It is evident that it should be integrated into present structures. One might ask why the change.

It is money for ordinary people who are vulnerable and deprived.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I welcome the Minister to the House. Having listened to his speech, I would have to say that this was not his finest hour. In fairness to Senator Ó Murchú, he is one of the more thoughtful contributors in this House, but his last contribution would hardly rank among his 250 best speeches to the House. It was a classic example that, despite the fact that Senator McHugh went out of his way to ensure that he did not criticise the Minister, civil servants or politicians, nonetheless the response on the other side was to act as if what he said was an argument ad hominem, an argument against the Minister, a criticism of civil servants, an implication that we could not trust our politicians. It is something that could be used in a training course for politicians as an example of what not to do when dealing with an issue.It was a great idea to take money from the banks and financial institutions. We all cheered it. I welcomed it in this House and congratulated the Minister on taking firm action against them, and not before time. Nobody disagreed. That was the beginning. What evolved is no more than a slush fund. This is shameful and appalling legislation. Listening to the Minister's speech in my office I thought I had the wrong legislation. I could not connect between the legislation and what the Minister was saying. If I have time I will go through it towards the end of my contribution.Senator Ó Murchú is a person who shows great sensitivity to the importance of political life, public representation and politics generally. I give him that and give it freely to him. However, this legislation will bring politics into disrepute. This is stroke politics at its best. This is cute-hoorism without boundaries. That is the way this legislation is going. I can see the party do-gooders slithering up to the local Dáil Deputy or Senator at the party function to ask him or her to make representations to the Minister on their behalf, and it will be done. As Senator Ó Murchú rightly said, there is nothing wrong with making representations. However, the response from the other side to my contribution will also be to assume I believe there is something wrong with it. There is nothing wrong with making representations. That is the way politics works and should work. We should make representations on behalf our communities. We should identify the disadvantaged and those who need support.However, we should not have to make representations to the Minister who is going to spend the money. It was not tax money, which is a different issue. This is money which was taken from the banks and it should be spent publicly in a way that gives people confidence. This is a recipe for disenchantment, disconnection, dismay and disappointment. It is not the way to do business. This is not the way the Government should respond to what it heard from the public two weeks ago during the elections. What will ordinary people read into the legislation? What kind of trust and confidence will this put into political life? What kind of status, will this give politicians? It has nothing to do with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. It is shameful that he should be drawn into this debate as he could be gone in September, or even next month. It does not matter who it is. The idea that we can pass legislation because we have a good Minister is neither here nor there.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	301	He will be gone with the money.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The issue is how it is done. It is not an issue of setting up a superstructure with a great amount of administration. I will outline a solution to the Minister that is so simple it does not need to be written down. The amount of administration required to spend €250 million will be the same whether it is done by an independent body or the Civil Service. Therefore, those good people in the Civil Service should do the administration but the decision making should be controlled by an independent body and not by the Minister. There will be no difficulty, no problem, no extra people employed, no extra work to be done. Ordinary people should be given the chance to make it work and then we can do it.The establishment of a body to do this is shameful. We are 16 or 17 years into partnership in this country, yet there is no reflection of civic society, the social partners, the voluntary and community pillar, of the people in the Wheel and various other groups and charities in Ireland who give and give. These are the people who should be making the decisions on this. We, and the Minister could trust them because they have no agenda and are beyond political decision making, but are not beyond political reach. We could all make our representations if we chose to do so. I could make a case about a disadvantaged school, while Senator Ó Murchú could make a case about a disadvantaged group of Travellers in his constituency. Let us put the case and let the people decide. We would then have to live with the outcome. There is nothing wrong with that and it would be a mark of character for the Government were it to do that. The idea of a representation to a body that decides is different to a representation to a Minister.There are parts of this legislation that would not be passed in Iraq. For example, in the case of the membership of the board, there has been almost one board appointee per month in the last two or three years. Members of boards represent something, be it gender balance or various groups such as the social partners and so on. In this situation, however, the board shall consist of ten ordinary members, all of whom are to be appointed by the Minister. That cannot be right. Where is the sharing of responsibility? Where is the openness to partnership? Where is the invitation to civic society? It is not there but it should be.The worst feature of the Bill is the provision that having consulted with the appropriate Minister, the Minister shall, not less than once in each year, make submissions to the Government for its approval with or without amendment. The term "with or without amendment" is repeated time and again. In this instance it refers to the role of the Minister.The Bill also provides that the Minister is to have regard to the approved plan. What does "have regard to" mean? It certainly means that he does not have to do what is in the plan. He has to read it and have regard to it, so if the plan decides that a certain percentage of money should be spent in disadvantaged areas in the inner city, he should have regard to that, but he might also have regard to a disadvantaged areas somewhere else for a different reason.This will be tainted by politics and it is no help to Ministers to put them in this situation. If anyone takes the opportunity to look at the Order of Business for any day in this House, there are usually six pages of business laid before the House which means there is little or no likelihood that there will be an opportunity to debate submissions made to the House by the board. For example, the Health Insurance Authority annual report is listed No. 18 on today's Order Paper. The report from the body to be established by this Bill will probably be listed No. 19 on the Order Paper for this day next year. It will be submitted to the Minister, we will read it but we will have no input whatever.There is nothing wrong with us having no input if the board was run independently. However, that is not the case. In consequence, what is proposed here is wrong. The Minister of State spoke about independent planning and critical appraisal. The Bill might provide for that but it will be to no avail. Ultimate decisions will not lie with the board. This is the kind of thing that gives rise to bushfires of discontent throughout the country when it occurs. It has happened before and it will happen again in this instance.I could write a history of my involvement in disadvantaged schemes in education and how Minister after Minister has interfered with them due to pressure from constituencies or representations. This is a classic example because while the objectives are laudable, the board has been established without criteria or a frame of reference. The Bill provides that the board will assist persons who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. If I complain about this I will be represented as having no soul. To be against such a provision is like being against virtue, or being in favour of sin. However, the legislation is full of traps. That is bad for the body politic and for what we are trying to achieve. It will once again lead politics into disrepute. The idea that €250 million will be available for a Minister to disburse on the basis of representations made is enough to make the political cute hoors salivate at the prospect. It is indicative of the kind of pressure that will be imposed on Ministers.I appeal to the Minister to have another look at this legislation because in its present form it drags down the Minister, the Government and politics. It adds to disenchantment and takes away from trust and confidence in the body politic. It is proposed that decisions on giving money to people who are underprivileged, disadvantaged and so on should be given to a Minister. We believe that it should be given to independent people. This could be done without spending any money. Any of us could nominate people who would take the decision away from us. We could then make our position known to them. As Senator Ó Murchú stated, the civil servants could do their job effectively, but ultimately, decisions would be made by the board.I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with this legislation and to introduce a new board which should represent civic society, in particular those who work for community and voluntary organisations. Every special school in this country has friends and relatives who from groups of supporters. There will be a fundraiser tomorrow morning in this House for two children's charities. These are people who work all their lives to raise money to fight disability and disadvantage. Could they not be included in the decision making process? I do not refer to the planning but the decision making process. Could we not trust them to spend this money, which has been correctly taken from the banks and the financial institutions? It is money that belonged to the people and should be given back to the people, by the people, under our supervision. What is wrong with that? Why can we not do it? Why can we not do something right that will make a difference? I appeal to the Minister of State to give the decision back to the people.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and recognise his commitment to the work that goes on in the charitable and voluntary sector. I have no intention in raising my voice or making political points on this. I do not impugn anyone's motives or intentions. However, I regret the direction that the proposed legislation is taking. It is retrograde.I welcomed the action that was taken to set up the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board. I pointed out that there was a comparable body in Northern Ireland called the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust, which was set up a number of years ago. It acted as a sort of community chest and was owned by the community sector, although it was set up and additionally funded by the government. It has done remarkable work over the years and I look forward to this board doing the same. It seems a little early to begin to pull it apart again, unless there have been serious difficulties, either in the disbursement or the handling of money. The Minister spoke of wishing to give focus to the work. Senator Ó Murchú told us that very few complaints could be lodged against the allocations. If it is a matter of administration, as Senator O'Toole said, these matters must be assessed either by someone in a Department or by someone under the aegis of the board. It should not be too difficult to arrange for that on a satisfactory basis.The Minister spoke of public funds, and I acknowledge that people must be careful about money. However, I am not sure whether one can call dormant accounts "public funds" in the classic sense. They belong not to the State but to someone else, perhaps only theoretically, but there are putative owners out there. The State has in effect borrowed the funds for a period to use them. We should always distinguish between funds raised by taxation and those raised in other ways, treating the dormant accounts as charitable funds.One of the difficulties in the proposals is that decisions are made in Departments. I would be the last in this House to say nasty things about civil servants, having been one for most of my life. However, not all wisdom resides in Departments. The difficulty is that Departments, and civil servants working in them, are accustomed to viewing problems through a specific set of lenses. People in the community sometimes see them through a different set. One runs the danger of systematising and codifying the grants, irrespective of who makes the final decision. One can cut out the odd or quirky idea that might make a difference, or the person who does not fit in with departmental perspectives.There is an even greater danger that Departments will see this money as an extension of the funds available to them from elsewhere and use it either to develop their own programmes or to save them spending money on them. It is a very basic principle of charity law that charitable funds should not be used to save money raised by rates or taxes, and I apply that reasoning to this. These moneys are free and should not be used to substitute for taxation or save expenditure on programmes that should be funded out of taxation in the ordinary way. It gives people the opportunity to do something extra or different — to experiment — and it must be in the ownership of the voluntary and community sector. I cannot think of anyone who would sit on a board asked to draw the map of the world and see whether the sea has run dry, without any function regarding expenditure in the interval.The concept of having money that could be applied in such a manner was splendid when it was developed. No one could take exception to the objectives being discussed, and it is a red herring to begin discussing them. We are simply discussing the best way to handle the disbursement of these moneys and the best way of selecting projects that should be supported. It would be helpful and much more productive if the voluntary and community sector could have some sense of ownership in this matter. It should not simply be seen as an extension of departmental programmes or another part of public expenditure but as an exciting new opportunity for people, and that is better done by revivifying and strengthening the board that we have and strengthening its procedures. One should by all means impose what accounting arrangements one thinks proper. However, one takes a retrograde step if one draws it totally into the Government sector.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Like other Senators on this side of the House, we in the Labour Party are appalled at this legislation and the extraordinary U-turn by the Government on commitments it gave to the Oireachtas and the people when the original Dormant Accounts Act 2001 was passed. That had the support of Oireachtas Members, not surprisingly, considering that it set up a system whereby dormant accounts were to be disbursed in a fair and independent fashion. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, referred to that, even saying the money should be independently disbursed so it was not seen as a slush fund. The Minister should not have any hand, act or part in it.It was an extraordinary U-turn by this Administration using the guise of transparency to claim the entire system needed to be changed. The only transparent thing about the changes being made by the Government is the smash and grab at funds to create a slush fund for its own purposes. The Minister has seen a fund similar to the lottery fund and wants full control of it. He will give it to his friends and use it for political patronage and to buy votes. The sheer arrogance of the manner in which that has been done is breathtaking.We are now three weeks on from the local and European elections, and it is quite clear the Government has not got the message from the electorate. One of the things the electorate is reacting against very strongly is the arrogance of this Administration, and this legislation is a transparent example of how arrogant it has become. Funds that have become available through the work and decisions of the all-party Committee of Public Accounts are now being taken over by the Administration for sheer political gain, and it thinks the public will not notice. It is wrong, since the public has noticed and will continue to do so. It is an appalling abuse of power by the Government. The principle underlying this amending legislation demonstrates clearly that the Government uses power, and especially money, for its own ends.I remind the Minister that the money does not belong to the Government. Like taxpayers' money, it belongs to the people and should be disbursed by their independent representatives. A board is being set up that will be appointed by the Minister to draw up a plan that will be sent to him but which he could effectively ignore. The Minister of State set it out in his speech today, saying the plan would go to the Government and the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet would decide how the funds are spent. That is exactly what will happen, as happens with national lottery funds. The list will be drawn up, and we can be absolutely sure the Ministers will drive around to announce to the groups which are to get the money that they have reason to be thankful they are in office. They will tell them it is great that they are getting €2,000. During the last election we saw Ministers driving around in State cars to visit sports clubs and call meetings of school committees and various other organisations, often on a Sunday morning, to announce the wonderful news about the grant. It will be exactly the same with this slush fund. People, will be called in to be given the great news about the grant, which constitutes patronage of the highest order, but people are no longer prepared to be patronised. This fund has come from dormant accounts, from fine work done by the Committee of Public Accounts, and the original board set up by the Minister for Finance had support in principle from all parties. Its work was anticipated by the community and voluntary sector and Senator McHugh has observed the treachery that was wreaked on that sector by this extraordinary U-turn. It has been abandoned by the provisions of this proposed legislation and members of the sector will have to wait in line quietly like everyone else and behave like good girls and boys if they are to receive a few euro from this fund because the decision is ultimately at the discretion of the Minister.This legislation represents a bad day's work. The Minister of State says it is necessary for corporate governance but I dispute that. I have seen no justification in the current set-up or in the proposed legislation for the so-called need for corporate governance. Of course there should be accountability for public funds but this Bill does not represent accountability, it is merely a grabbing exercise. The Minister's decisions regarding allocation may be published but we will draw our own conclusions about the reasons for those decisions when we observe money being allocated to the Government's friends in the various constituencies. This Bill represents an appalling show of arrogance and condescension by the Government and, like previous decisions, will not go unnoticed. The Government will gets its answer and we will be opposing Second Stage.

As the Minister of State observed, the legislation is concerned with streamlining an important process. One must consider the areas to which these funds are being allocated and the impact they are having and Senator McHugh sought clarification on this point. The answer is obvious and is indicated in the explanatory memorandum and is explained in detail in the Bill. These are areas of social, educational and economic disadvantage and surely Senator McHugh would recognise such an area if he saw it. As he correctly observed, my constituency is an area designated for both the RAPID programme and the drugs task force scheme. I was privileged to be involved at the foundation of the task forces, which was an initiative that came from the community.There has been much talk of the community and voluntary sector but I find myself in the unfamiliar position of observing that Senator O'Toole is being a little naive in his comments regarding the allocation of the funds and the decision as to same. We are talking about a fund of €250 million and one could spend a sizeable portion of that travelling around the country to ask each voluntary organisation how much it requires and for what purpose. The provisions of the Bill will avoid that and it is to be welcomed from that perspective.

This Bill increases the transparency of the process by making the Minister for Finance more accountable for the allocation of funds. The process is already transparent. For example, I was able to access the website of Area Development Management Limited and see specifically how and for what purpose funds were disbursed. Some €157,000 was allocated to the Merchant's Quay Project and a figure for managing drug-related neighbourhood programmes was given. That is detail, accountability and openness.

Some commentators would have us believe that County Galway and the islands are the only places to benefit from this fund but they are not. I meet project members on a daily basis who have already accessed the fund even though only €5 million has so far been disbursed. The benefits are there for all to see and Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú was particularly astute when he mentioned the civil servants who will be involved in this process.

When one observes the effects of this fund on the various different schemes and considers similar previous schemes, such as the young persons' facilities and services fund, it is clear that areas of particular disadvantage have benefited greatly. These schemes have been administered by Departments and not by independent boards or specially commissioned quangos. Communities have benefited on the ground, particularly in areas designated for the RAPID programme. We could spend substantial amounts of money administering these schemes but we would then have to tell the people on Sean McDermott Street, for example, who want a playground so that their children do not have to play on busy roads that the money was spent on administration. The thrust of this proposed legislation is concerned with the need for the Government to take responsibility for implementing those strategies for which it was elected——

Prior to that one had to go from Billy to Jack, from one Department to another, to get a hearing. Now one can go directly to the Minister and present one's case. As Senator O'Toole observed, our job is to make representations on behalf of people and we must work with the system that is in place. The proposed legislation strengthens that system.The community and voluntary sector is very political and each group protects its own little patch. It is necessary that somebody should decide how each of these groups is put in order of need. That is what the fund does and the funds are equitably distributed on the basis of that need. This is in addition to what is already available from the various funds providing facilities around the country.The legislation, on which I congratulate the Minister of State and his Department, is welcome. I look forward to it passing through the House.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, but regret the Minister with responsibility for the overall workings of the new board is not present as I wanted to highlight some of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's statements on the last occasion on dormant accounts as well as some of those of the Minister of State.I suggest we change the Title of the Bill from the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 to the Government Slush Fund Bill 2004 or the Post-Election Disaster Fund Bill 2004. Senator Brady admitted the facts behind the lists circulated recently. As stated by him, the grants approved by ADM Limited clearly indicate that every recipient was worthy of the funding provided. The spin put on it by Members on the Government side tonight suggests that something is wrong. It is hinted that something could be wrong with regard to the civil servants.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	318	That is the spin and I am delighted the Senator has admitted this. I am correct in suggesting that there is a spin which runs right through the various contributions of Members on the Government side. The reality, as most can see, is that this is about control, arrogance and greed; that Ministers want to share in what is now a slush fund of €500 million. Has everyone forgotten the statement of the Minister for Finance in the Dáil on 20 June 2001? He justified the setting up of the board by stating:To get away from the problem of having the Government blamed as having a slush fund it has been decided to establish a board of trustees. This board will distribute the money, subject to guidelines and without the direction from the Government.Has the Minister of State forgotten this? He conveniently left it out of his speech. All others on the Government side have also forgotten about it. On the last occasion this matter was debated with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister of State accused me by saying, in effect, that it was strange to see Opposition speakers praising the Minister for Finance for taking such action. Those were the words expressed by Members on the Government side. They have conveniently forgotten this tonight.In the preamble to the Bill it is stated the objectives are the same. They are worthy. However, has the Government no confidence in the board to do the work involved? As is clearly indicated and outlined here, it is regarded as being very satisfactory, highly commendable and acceptable to those who have applied to it. The preamble states the objectives underpinning the disbursement of the fund remain unchanged, which is important.What other four areas could be identified as more worthy of funding than the RAPID and CLÁR programmes, drug abuse in disadvantaged areas and disability services? The problem is we will not be able to rely on the independence of the board in analysing claims from any of those sources without ministerial interference. I am not describing it as Civil Service interference. I am not describing it as anything other than ministerial interference, particularly under the stewardship of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I will not trust him in having the last say, even though it may be a Cabinet decision. If that is the case, all share the blame on this occasion.From the record on CLÁR programme funding and how it has been delivered, as referred to by Senator Maurice Hayes, the fund has been raided. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has raided it for the delivery of a prop up measure in respect of what has happened in the community employment schemes which were being wiped out. On his own admission in this House, it took him two years to hatch this one — the rural social scheme. We found it hard to find an example of an application form or the criteria to be applied. Eventually he said the one thing that would be required was a herd number.This legislation has all the hallmarks of a Government which is panicking. There is a huge surplus in a certain area which has been identified and it wants control over it. It has no confidence whatever in the board. The Minister of State throws out a gratuitous comment that members of the board can be reappointed. The likelihood of this happening — we await final decisions — is unreal. The fact they are now being replaced is a sure indication there has been a vote of no confidence by Ministers in this instance. I fail to see how they would survive and adhere to the demands of Ministers. The Bill is all about the power to control and direct funding in particular areas. Unfortunately, we are back once again to stroke politics where the Government will direct funding in accordance with public representations.We have been criticised before. I read a letter from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in which he criticised me for mentioning dormant accounts in a letter I wrote to him. He misrepresented and put a spin on my letter to suit himself and get off the hook as regards his own record on the appropriation of funds under the CLÁR programme. That is not good enough.We, on this side of the House, will totally oppose this legislation every time it comes before us. We will obstruct it in every way possible in order that the fund will not become the slush fund intended by the Government, in particular, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and support the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004. It is appropriate legislation. In fact, I am surprised any Member of the House would criticise a Government for carrying out its functions in a responsible manner. The Bill regulates the disbursement of massive amounts of public money left in dormant accounts. The Government has made a good policy decision in terms of its use. It is right that we seek to put the current ad hoc arrangement on a statutory basis. Public representatives and Ministers would have little confidence in themselves if they could not be involved in the approval, following proper application and publication, of those who have been successful.I have total confidence in the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs and in all other Ministers who will have responsibility under this legislation to ensure the money is appropriated in a proper fashion. They will be ultimately responsible to the Oireachtas while those holding temporary positions on the board will have no such responsibility. Under the Bill, the chairman of the present organisation would have to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. It is unfair to expect a non-executive chairman to take responsibility for that type of funding.The proposal to ensure that current structures are utilised is also worthwhile. There have been far too many situations where substantial amounts of the money provided for the establishment of new organisations and jobs has been spent on administration. The Bill will ensure the costs of distribution will be kept to a minimum with the maximum amount being given to those in need of funds. I am delighted to note the proposal to make available €222 million, almost a quarter of a billion euro, in that regard. That is a sizeable amount of money, more than the amount available to many Departments.The areas of priority will be RAPID, CLÁR and the drugs task force, which are very worthwhile organisations. I fail to understand why Opposition Senators are in such a lather about this legislation. One would think the Government was proposing to disburse money without any public accountability. There is total public accountability under the Bill. It would be remiss of Government not to introduce this legislation.

I believe the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs are doing tremendous work in this area, particularly in terms of the CLÁR programme, of which I have some experience. I will provide Members with an example of how the CLÁR programme works. When a community centre in Strokestown, Castlecoote or other parts of County Roscommon is approved, it receives a top-up from the CLÁR programme. There is no bureaucracy involved. Those successful in obtaining funding receive a 20% top-up of the amount approved from the programme. I am not sure if that is the correct percentage but perhaps the Minister of State will confirm that in his reply. There is no bureaucracy involved in the application of the top-up. That money is going to the most deprived areas.

That is reasonable.I am pleased the Government has taken the initiative in introducing the Bill.

The Bill is stroke politics at its worst. I am astonished Fianna Fáil, which is an astute party in terms of its monitoring of the electorate, has introduced such legislation. I am amazed given that party's problems in the recent local and European elections that it has brought it forward. The electorate will not be fooled by it.I am involved in many charities and have repeatedly heard people say they will seek money from the dormant funds. Senator Leyden is correct, the Government is putting in place a simple system. Senator Ó Murchú is also correct to suggest that all that will be required is for people to knock on the right door late at night to be sure they get what they want. However, many other people will not be in a position to knock on the right door late at night to do this. They will remember how the Government changed the way in which such funds were managed.When it was believed that the amount involved would be small, everything was simple and straightforward. I resent the suggestion that Members said civil servants would not be capable or impartial in administering these funds. I cannot believe that what was a good operation is being changed in this way. I support everything said by Senator O'Toole and Fine Gael and Labour colleagues. It is a pity the system is being changed in this way.I have only one thing to say to Fianna Fáil Members. This is the type of action on which the electorate will pick up and remember. Many people will be left out and even if they are left out for good reason, they will feel it was because they were unable to knock on the right door late at night. I regret the introduction of this legislation.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I agree with what has been said by the previous speaker and by most speakers who expressed concerns about this Bill. Senator Leyden, in the midst of other things, said this money belongs to the public, which is crucial and goes to the heart of the matter. The Bill proposes to change radically the original plan to distribute these public funds.Senator Henry is correct in saying the Government got a lashing in the local and European elections. It was clear when campaigning that was going to happen. I cannot understand why the Government would choose to pull this type of stroke in the immediate aftermath of that drumming. However, I and many other Senators are familiar with what took place in the run up to the last general election when, as Senator O'Meara pointed out, Government candidates went around shouting about the amount of money they had acquired for different local community groups for the development of facilities and services. They were claiming to be using public funds as a type of slush fund in order to promote their election. We are seeing the establishment of a new national slush fund. Senator Ulick Burke was correct to propose a change in the name of the Bill. He quoted a number of people, but I would like to highlight some other quotes. When the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, spoke on a previous Bill in 2002, he said:With regard to the issues raised by Deputies, to avoid the perception that the Government would use the moneys involved as some kind of slush fund it was always proposed and subsequently effected that an independent board would be established to distribute the surplus moneys from the fund. This board was appointed earlier this year and will distribute the surplus money, subject to guidelines in the 2001 Act.During a Seanad debate on the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill 2002 in February 2003, the Minister of State said:Regarding the point made by Senators John Paul Phelan and McDowell that the money in the dormant account fund could be used as a slush fund, obviously the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has no intention of doing this. The Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the fund be used for charitable and community purposes, which is exactly what is provided for in the Bill. The involvement of the disbursements board is significant in that surplus moneys, subject to the guidelines laid down in the 2001 Act, would be disbursed by the board under the overall policy guidelines given by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.The Bill before the House today proposes to change that completely and absolutely.The reason the Government is bringing forward this legislation was let slip by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, during a radio interview some months ago. The Minister admitted, more or less, that the Government changed its mind on this issue because it originally thought the amount of money would be insignificant and the fund would be relatively small. When it became apparent that the fund would come to several hundred million euro, it had to be grabbed and used as a political football in the run-up to the general election. It will be used by Government candidates left, right and centre in the run-up to the next election. They will say that a certain amount of money is available to them to develop facilities in their constituencies. The fund will not be used in the manner that was originally intended.My late colleague, Mr. Jim Mitchell, expressed his reservations about possible abuses when it was announced in 2001 that a dormant accounts fund was to be established. At that time, he was reassured by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that the board would be independent and that the disbursement of the funds would be completely independent. We should not be surprised that the Government has reneged on its commitment as it seems to have been good at back-tracking in recent years.A number of Government Senators mentioned the RAPID programme, which is a particular bone of contention for me. The programme is a complete failure in New Ross in County Wexford, the nearest large town to where I live. It has been launched by different Ministers or Ministers of State on three occasions, most recently in the immediate run-up to the local and European elections. A Minister of State who was a candidate in the European elections launched the RAPID programme in New Ross for the third time. Very little has happened in New Ross to indicate that benefits have accrued from the programme. If the programme is to be held up as a example of what we can expect from the distribution of dormant account funds, the Government should re-examine this measure. Many improvements are needed in that regard.The Bill is a completely retrograde and cynical political manoeuvre. It is a example of opportunism of the worst form, which we have not seen for a long time. I hope and believe the public will see through it and see the Government's decision for what it is, a grab by the Government for funds which belong to the public, as Senator Leyden correctly pointed out in his contribution. The Government is engaging in a cynical attempt to get its hands on a pot of money it did not think would be so large. It is sending the wrong message to people at a time when serious question marks are being asked about politicians, politics and people in public office. It is a serious mistake for the Government to be seen to be acting in such a manner. I urge the Government to reconsider its decision.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I welcome the Bill. If I interpret correctly the general thrust of this legislation, it is a mechanism to reduce the general level of bureaucracy and administration required by anyone operating a large scheme of this type. I recall the discussion that took place about minimising bureaucracy when the national lottery was being established. It was necessary to keep administration to a minimum so the funds that accrued from the lottery could go directly to the various projects. The matter was dealt with capably by the various Departments that were involved. The then Departments of Health and Social Welfare and the bodies dealing with sport, leisure and recreation — the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism was not in place at the time — administered the various schemes efficiently and carefully. To my knowledge, Members on the Opposition benches have never criticised the way the schemes were handled.I wish to ask the Minister of State about his comment that an additional €30 million has been allocated to projects this year. I understand that the closing date for applications for the original €30 million was 5 March last. Now that the fund has been doubled and an additional €30 million has been allocated, I am concerned that fresh applications cannot be made at this stage. Will the consideration of applications be confined to applications that were made by 5 March? I would consider such an arrangement to be somewhat unsatisfactory. I would like some latitude to be given, now that an additional €30 million has been provided. Those who missed out on 5 March and were waiting for the chance to apply for the next allocation should be given a few weeks to get in their applications.This matter involves a substantial amount of money. Applications were made earlier this year on the basis that €30 million was available. If it is the case that a further €30 million is available, a mechanism should be put in place to enable additional applications to be sought. I do not mean that the timeframe for applications should be extended for the entire year, but it might be a good idea to accept additional applications until the middle of July. Applications were not made by a number people representing good projects because they did not think sufficient funding would be made available. They anticipate that their applications would be successful on this occasion if they were to be allowed to make them.The thrust of the legislation is to reduce bureaucracy. It is adequate and satisfactory to deal with the fund by means of existing administrative arrangements in Departments. In my view, such a system has worked well with national lottery allocations.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I recall that during a heated discussion on this issue during Private Members' time, I was extremely vocal in my criticism of the con job that is being perpetrated by the Government. I was present in the Dáil when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that the board would be established as a separate entity so it could be independent in its divesting of funds. He said that such a measure would ensure that the fund would not be misconstrued as a Government slush fund. How credible are the Minister's remarks now? Has the current Administration learned anything from the recent election? Has it taken notice of the wisdom of the electorate, which has been watching the Government's actions closely? The people are critical of decisions such as those taken in respect of Punchestown and electronic voting. If one thinks the electorate is gullible, one is mistaken because it can see through the Government's actions. Almost €250 million has been placed in the dormant accounts fund. I do not believe the Minister envisaged that type of funding when he was researching what would be available and now that it is available, the Government wants to have a hold over it.In regard to the board of directors, the Minister is expanding the membership from nine to 11. In a previous position I was spokesman on the marine and I remember the then Minister introducing a change in regard to a board with responsibility for the estuary, which became the Shannon Foynes Port Company. Coming from Foynes, I was very enthusiastic about that at the time because I felt it would help the long-term development of the estuary. The then Minister reassured me in the House at the time that the directors he would appoint would be people with tremendous ability in the sphere of business and port activities but of the 11 members of that board, six were Fianna Fáil councillors. To my mind, that was a type of distortion.The Minister set up an independent board, which was prepared to divest these funds and was accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, but casting aspersions on a part-time chairperson by saying it was wrong to have him responsible, as a part-time chairperson, to the Committee of Public Accounts is a rather dramatic statement which is not practical. I doubt very much if the €0.25 billion was intended to be divested in one fell swoop. I anticipate it would have been divested over a period but what did the Minister do? He raised the membership from nine to 11 and, in what will be another stroke by the Government, I envisage the people who will be on the disbursement board will be friends of the party. That is the reality of what will happen.I said earlier that the people have not been fooled. The Minister was greedy. He saw a pot of gold but he should reflect on the national lottery funding which was mentioned earlier in terms of its benefits for youth and sport facilities throughout the country. There have been achievements in that area but I know what happens in regard to organisations which come to me seeking assistance filling in the paperwork to apply for lottery funding. When they go to the Government representatives in the area, and it happens in west Limerick, Clare and elsewhere, a telephone call is made to the appropriate Fianna Fáil politician in the area or, in very rare instances, the Progressive Democrats representative, to tip them off about the funding that will be made available.Accountability and transparency is referred to in the Bill, which states that details of the funds that are allocated will be published. They will be published in a pseudo attempt at transparency, as is done with details of national lottery funds, but the Minister should ask every politician, particularly Fianna Fáil politicians, about the largesse dispensed in their constituencies, particularly marginal constituencies. He will hear about the tip-offs and the meetings held to tell them that the money was on its way or that they would be getting €0.50 million or €100,000, as the case may be.

That is regrettable.We talk about catering for people experiencing disadvantage and those with educational needs. That is laudable but where will this money be dispensed? It will be in the areas where representations are made, particularly by Fianna Fáil politicians, and in marginal areas. The Government will do that with the ambition of winning more seats.For the first time during the last election, and I have been canvassing since 1985, when I arrived at people's doors in other areas I was asked which party I represented. I proudly said "Fine Gael" and they said that if I had been one of the other crowd, I would not have been welcome. That happened on doorsteps in rural Ireland and it never happened before, but these type of strokes will ensure that it will happen again. The electorate will not forgive the Government for this type of stroke because we will remind them what it is doing lest it covers what it is trying to introduce in this Bill in a shroud of deception.

It was interesting to hear the Senators' different perspectives, and I thank them for those, but the Senator zoned in on one interpretation of a particular aspect.Several Members said all the money belongs to the people and that is correct. Whether it is this fund or general taxation funds, it is the people's money but the Government of the day has the job of putting structures and procedures in place to administer and manage that money. That is important. I realise this board is established only a few years but if problems arise, it is important to address them. That is the Government's responsibility.There appears to be an obsession about who makes the phone call, who is knocking on doors late at night and so on. To take up Senator Henry's point, under the existing scheme, groups will apply and will be successful, while others will not. That is the position under the current set-up and when that set-up changes, it will remain the position.When the original legislation was set up, it was not envisaged that the fund would be as big as it is now. It is not €500 million by the way; it is €220 million. I do not believe it will reach €500 million, or anything like that, because——

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The money from the insurance fund turned out to be less than what some people were forecasting. People are claiming back money and from now on the money that comes in will not be as old, so to speak. There is a possibility that more of it will be claimed back. A total of €30 million was allocated and decisions on 58 applications have been made to date, totalling €6.4 million.On Senator Daly's point, applications closed on 9 March and the board is of the view currently that if it were to award funding to all the applications received it might need €300 million rather than €30 million, but applications are always over-stated. The additional €30 million awarded by the Government last week was to allow it to adequately process all the applications received and to make awards in that respect. That €60 million will allow all the applications received up to the closing date in March to be addressed. If this new legislation goes through and the arrangements are changed, that will be the next amount of money, but €60 million has been allocated to the existing system.The figure is higher than was originally set out and if people envisage problems arising there are very good reasons, in terms of governance and public policy, that changes are necessary. A situation cannot be allowed where a part-time chairman is legally responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts for expenditure of that level. That is just not done. Otherwise it will drift on for a few years until a problem arises suddenly and we are all in the manure business, so to speak.

I note the need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide an integrated cancer care service, including radiotherapy, at Waterford Regional Hospital as it now satisfies the critical mass criteria laid down in the Hollywood report, which was accepted by the Government. Less than a month ago, 15,000 people marched through the streets of Waterford demanding fair play and equity of access to radiotherapy services for the people of the south east.The region is united in its quest for a totally integrated cancer care service at Waterford Regional Hospital. Government general election candidates, including a current Minister, promised this facility would be up and running within three years. The fact that this promise continues to be reneged on wreaked havoc on Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats candidates during the local elections. Fianna Fáil has just one representative out of 15 on Waterford City Council and the Progressive Democrats were wiped out completely. The story is the same on Waterford County Council where Fianna Fáil lost three seats and likewise in south Kilkenny and New Ross.This is a major issue. The message must be clear by now that the people of the south east demand equity of access to radiotherapy services, similar to Dublin, Cork and Galway. The Hollywood report spoke of critical mass or population requirements to secure radiotherapy in a region. The population projections from the Central Statistics Office indicate an increase in population growth to approximately 418,000 by 2010 and 423,000 by 2015 in the south east region, which would justify two linear accelerators. The fact of the matter is that the south east currently has a population of 423,616 as per the 2002 census figures. The region already surpasses the criteria laid down in the report and accepted by the Government.The Department appears hell bent on proceeding with the recommendations of the report. The people of the south east demand that, as we satisfy the requirements and conditions, immediate steps must be taken to plan for radiotherapy facilities at Waterford Regional Hospital to cater for all the people of the south east, including public and private patients. The red herring of a private hospital providing facilities has added to the frustration of the people in the region. The Minister is on record as being opposed to buying services for public patients from private operators. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, and the Tánaiste are of a different view. The fact is that the Government is dithering on this matter while patients die in the south east.I call on the Minister of State to give a clear and unequivocal statement that Waterford will be given the same equity of access to radiotherapy as Cork, Dublin and Galway and that, as the Minister said, funding will be concentrated and prioritised in the regions that satisfy the criteria laid down in the Hollywood report. Waterford cannot be forgotten if the Minister insists on implementing the provisions of the report. The ordinary decent and caring people of the south east will not allow the issue to go away. The bottom line is that Waterford must now be part of the national backbone which will create sufficient volume, machines and expertise in a multidisciplinary team as outlined in the Hollywood report.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The Minister apologises for being unable to be here this evening and he has asked me to reply to the debate on his behalf.As the House is aware, the report on the development of radiation oncology services was published in October 2003. The recommendations of the report, which have been accepted and endorsed by the Government, provide the only sustainable plan for the future development of radiation oncology services nationally. The development of these services on the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority in cancer services in the acute setting. In developing its recommendations, the expert group undertook an extensive review of the organisation of radiation oncology services in countries such as Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Britain, Canada and Australia. The predominant view of the group, based on international guidelines of best practice, was that radiation oncology services would be best developed in the context of a clinical network model of large centres where new treatment centres have appropriate staff and equipment resources based around a minimum four to six linear accelerator treatment capacity.The development of a modern radiation therapy centre is an extremely complex process which requires the installation and integration of high technology treatment equipment and the parallel appointment of an extensive range of health care professionals, particularly in the fields of radiation oncology, radiation therapy-therapeutic radiography, medical physics, engineering and information technology and oncology nursing. The group developed a series of guidelines to facilitate the future identification of suitable locations for the development of additional radiation therapy facilities. These include a sufficient patient population existing within a proposed catchment area to support the existing and future development of a radiation oncology service.The resident population of a catchment area and, as a consequence, the extrapolated patient caseload is an important indicator of future patient referral, access and use of a radiation oncology centre. The group agreed in principle with the existing international recommendations that a population of greater than 650,000 should be, where possible, the minimum preferred population necessary to support a radiation oncology unit. Based on the 2002 census, the current population of the South Eastern Health Board area is 414,000. The minimum preferred population of itself is not sufficient without adherence to additional guidelines highlighted in the report, which include appropriate staffing and location at or linkage to a university teaching hospital.Having considered the report, the Government agrees that a major programme is required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first phase of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres located in Dublin, Cork and Galway, providing services for adjoining regions. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the backbone of the future service expansion. This Government agrees with the report's conclusion that this is the best model to rapidly provide a radiation oncology service. In addition, the Government has also decided that in the further development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres in the south east, mid-west and north west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.I wish to take this opportunity on behalf of the Minister to outline the significant progress which has been achieved to date in the implementation of this report since its launch last October. The report recommends that there should be two treatment centres located in the eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. The Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health and Children has been asked to advise the Minister on the optimum location of radiation treatment facilities in Dublin. A detailed request for proposals issued last week to relevant hospitals. Hospitals have until 8 October 2004 to submit proposals for the organisation and development of radiation oncology services in the context of the delivery of supra-regional services.The immediate developments in the southern and western regions will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity. We have also provided for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. This includes three additional consultant radiation oncologists at the emerging centre in UCHG, two of whom have significant sessional commitments to the Mid-Western and North-Western Health Boards. Two additional consultant radiation oncologists will be appointed at CUH, with significant sessional commitments to the South-Eastern and Mid-Western Health Boards. Recruitment for these posts is underway. We currently have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. This will result in a significant increase in the number of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term.On the development of an equitable service that provides equal access for all, I wish to take this opportunity to assure the House that the principles of equity and access will underpin the development of future services. Radiation oncology centres will be required to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access, regardless of where they live. This task is not without challenges. It will require the development of innovative transport and accommodation arrangements for patients in outlying regions.The national radiation oncology co-ordinating group was established by the Minister on foot of the expert group report. The group comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group's remit encompasses the development of proposals to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. The group is currently developing proposals in this area which will involve consultation with all health boards.Recently, the Minister approved €1 million in funding to develop a national tele-synergy network for oncology services involving the current and planned providers of radiotherapy at St. Luke's Hospital, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway. These hospitals will operate as major tele-oncology nodes within a clinical network of hospitals linked to other hospitals outside their health board or authority functional areas, referring patients to the radiation oncology centres for clinical treatment or related services.The aim of the network is to improve service delivery and efficiency, to better use consultants' time, reduce consultant and patient travel and support earlier and better diagnosis. This will have important benefits for radiation oncology services in the south east. Tele-medicine is a key enabling technology to improve the networking of radiation oncology centres with outreach hospitals, thus supporting expert case review, multidisciplinary meetings, education and research.The developments under the expert group report describe an overall framework through which radiotherapy services can be developed and provided in the most co-ordinated and effective manner. The expert report on the development of radiation oncology services marks a significant milestone in radiation oncology services nationally and its guidelines and recommendations are essential in the development of these services for cancer patients over the next number of years.

#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I wish to highlight the need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reasons for cutbacks in the post leaving certificate, PLC, sector and the extent to which there was prior consultation with the partners. I raise this issue because the service from the post leaving certificate sector, particularly for the disadvantaged, was tremendous. There is a need for people to upskill and the PLC sector has given most students a sense of purpose, confidence and self-esteem, as well as providing a second chance in education. Many students have moved on to gain further educational qualifications.The cutbacks have deprived people of the opportunity to upskill and to get a second chance. Moreover, there was no consultation with the partners — the VECs, students, learners and providers. It is a draconian measure. In my county, Roscommon, there are now 50% less rural PLC places and five of the best and most committed teachers no longer have jobs. While it is accepted that there have been some problems in urban areas such as Dublin and Cork, a sledgehammer has been used to crack a nut and a very good PLC system is being attacked and undermined.To quote W.B. Yeats: "Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire." This draconian measure has put out many fires and I hope the Minister will reverse it.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad and thank Senator Feighan for raising the matter of post leaving certificate course provision. The PLC programme was introduced in 1985 with aid from the European Social Fund to provide integrated general education, vocational training and work experience for young people who had completed upper second level education or equivalent. PLC programmes are also provided for adults who return to education to obtain a qualification prior to returning to the workplace. The primary purpose of PLCs is to enhance the prospects of students of gaining employment. PLCs also provide an alternative route to entry to higher education in the institutes of technology through the National Council for Vocational Awards-Further Education and Training Awards Council links scheme.Since 1985, PLC courses have been developed in a wide range of disciplines supporting industry and community needs and have significantly widened the scope of educational provision. For example, during 2003-04, PLC courses were delivered in over 220 centres around the country in both second level schools and stand-alone colleges, mainly in the VEC sector, and the actual number of participants grew to over 29,000 from 12,000 in the 1989-90 academic year.The sector plays a key role in meeting skills needs. Government commitment to the sector is evident in the introduction of maintenance grants for students with effect from September 1998, recognition of programmes and national qualifications from the Further Education and Training Awards Council and with regard to the McIver review of the sector.In dealing with the question of PLC numbers, my Department is not in a position to approve all the PLC places applied for in any particular academic year. For example, a total of almost 41,000 places were sought nationwide for 2003-04 from a planned pool of approximately 28,500 places. Similarly, for the 2004-05 academic year, schools and colleges sought approval for some 40,000 places from a planned pool of 28,500 places. For the school year 2004-05, allocations for PLC courses have been made on the basis of the number of places approved for such courses for the school year 2003-04, or numbers enrolled, whichever is the lesser. In this regard, enrolments on PLC courses in 2003-04 have exceeded the approved number of places.Going forward, there will be a continuing requirement to plan and control numbers, to manage expenditure and to provide for future investment and growth, as necessary, within the context of overall educational policy and provision. My Department has been considering correspondence from VECs and schools in relation to the issues that have arisen in this regard. In addition, officials in my Department have met with the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Teachers' Union of Ireland. Decisions regarding the number of approved places for the 2004-05 academic year will be notified to VECs, schools and colleges by my Department in the next few days.In regard to the McIver report, one of the recommendations envisaged the formation of a council of further education colleges, the specific composition of which would be subject to further discussion. The rationale for this was that with decision making and development initiatives increasingly being centred at college level and with a very considerable amount of development work to be undertaken, there is a need for a body to represent the colleges. My Department is at present facilitating discussions with the various stakeholders to advance the establishment of the council.
