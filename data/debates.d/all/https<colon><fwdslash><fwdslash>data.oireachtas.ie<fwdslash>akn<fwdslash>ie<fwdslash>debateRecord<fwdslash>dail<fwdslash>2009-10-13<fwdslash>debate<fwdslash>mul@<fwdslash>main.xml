        <heading>Statement by An Ceann Comhairle. </heading>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_1">
          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_1">It is an accepted convention of our political system that the Ceann Comhairle should remain above political controversy.  Implied in that duty is an overriding obligation of fairness among all Members.  It was, therefore, inappropriate for me as Ceann Comhairle to respond publicly to various matters concerning costs incurred while I was Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  For many people my silence probably indicated an absence of justification and a lack of defence.  By failing to respond to the various charges and allegations published in the media, I surrendered the right to protect myself in the public media.  I did so to preserve the integrity and impartiality of the Office of Ceann Comhairle.  I have no regrets for upholding the duties of that office.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">My silence to date has been observed to ensure that the Office of Ceann Comhairle would not become the subject of political controversy.  I did not wish to establish a precedent in that regard.  Had I not stood back in full expectation that I would be afforded the constitutional opportunity to explain myself to this House and had I entered into robust debate, I thought I would inflict damage to the independent and neutral nature of the office.  When the public mood changed, however, I determined to put my case to the appropriate body established by the House with oversight of expenditure, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I was denied that opportunity by some Members of the House who decided to act without giving me a hearing.  My principal complaint is not against the media, which, in spite of frequent excesses, also carry out a valuable function in society and whose constitutional right — more, whose constitutional duty to freedom of expression — I freely acknowledge.  The members of the  press, however, have never denied me my right of reply.  On the contrary, that is all they demanded to date.  Their most recent objection was to my self-imposed silence, a silence which I kept, as I have already said, to protect my office from becoming involved in unseemly political debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">As I now depart from office, some matters require to be said of me and my office as Ceann Comhairle.  Before addressing these issues in greater detail, I want to clarify an important matter.  On Friday, 2 October, I published the records from my time as Ceann Comhairle.  The time chosen for the release of those records is a matter that was inspired not by any personal or media advantage, but by a far more important consideration.  Given the massive publicity and media frenzy that had attended the disclosure of my expenditure as Minister, I assumed the same would occur regarding the costs incurred as Ceann Comhairle.  I believed that this would have been a distraction to the Irish public when matters of profound importance to the future of this country were the subject of the recent referendum.  In my view, it was best to have that referendum decided on its individual political merits.  That is why I waited until Friday, 2 October.  In addition, the release of the records at that time secured parity of information for all media outlets.  No other motive existed for the timing of the release of these figures.  I want to assure the Members of the House of this fact.  I did not attempt to bury the information in other events, as some have suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">Since I have assumed the position of Ceann Comhairle and notwithstanding recent controversies, remarks by Members of the House, both Government and Opposition, have at times been generous and gracious.  I have at all times sought to uphold the high standards set by my predecessors.  I have been fair and have never been partisan.  I have never shown favouritism.  I have applied the rules equally to all Members of this House.  That is a record I believe I can be proud of.  I am very grateful to those Members who publicly testified to my impartiality.  It is some small consolation to me that no complaint is made of me in the discharge of my office in this House as Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I now want to address the issue of expenses and costs in a general way.  As the problem of expenses and costs is systemic in nature, the solution must be found within the system.  Paradoxically, I, as Ceann Comhairle, had committed myself to bringing about reform in the expenses scheme for Members of this House.  I now leave it to others to bring about the fundamental change that I believe is required to the regime for parliamentary expenses.  I regret that I will not be in office to preside over the implementation of such changes.  Public confidence in our institutions and our political life dictates that these changes be made and that they be radical in nature.  In so stating, I recognise something of an irony in relation to my own situation.  I leave office in the context of a costs controversy where my full defence has not been heard and where I perceive the treatment afforded to me — and in particular in this House — is that of a symbol of an expense regime and a costs regime that had been in operation for decades and that had fallen into public disrepute.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">While there may be a difference of scale with some in this House, there is no difference of principle between me and many others who are subject to those regimes.  That scale is accounted for by the nature of my portfolio as Minister and in the discharge of my functions as Ceann Comhairle.  So be it.  I will accept the verdict of informed judgment, but not the verdict of the disingenuous.  I will accept the judgment of my peers after their careful reflection on all the facts and fair procedures.  I will not allow my life in public service to be stained by the triumph of the half-truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I want to emphasise the following: travel, accommodation and related costs were all incurred on, or in connection with, official duties.  Such arrangements were made in accordance with established Department of Finance guidelines and practices.  This was the course of action I followed.  To be held to account for the discharge of one's public functions is part and parcel of the duties of office.  There are many layers of financial accountability in our system, to which I was subject without criticism or challenge.  That was so for more than 12 years.  These accounts were approved by the statutory Accounting Officer.  They were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, but what I find somewhat discomforting is the concept of a new parallel system of accountability when compliance with directions, guidelines and standards was the hallmark of what I did.  That is why I believe it was all the more important that I would have been afforded a fair opportunity to put my case to this House in an appropriate forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">I never acted in secret or sought to conceal from public knowledge or accountability the expenditure on my functions.  I never transgressed any procedure, guidelines or regulation.  I never committed any offence.  I am not guilty of any corruption.  I never took money or abused my office for my own enrichment.  All these costs were paid to service providers.  I did not receive a penny from such costs.  These are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I do not seek to derogate from or diminish my previous apology in any respect.  However, I think the public should be aware even at this early stage of the review of documentation of manifest misstatements about costs.  I shall address this presently.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">In these days of financial constraint and hardship, I accept that viewed through this prism some costs are excessive.  At the time that was not my perception and I did not have knowledge of the cumulative sums involved.  That a current day analysis of past practices carried out in different times and in compliance with established procedure may contribute to public cynicism about politics and politicians is something I profoundly regret.  This was never my intention.  It is something for which I repeat my heartfelt apology to the people.  That my motives and my actions could be misconstrued in the light of changed circumstances is not something that ever occurred to me but, as the House shall presently hear, I believe the public impression that is abroad needs to be tempered by factual corrections.  I do this not to diminish my apology, but to explain myself and to show what explanation I could readily have advanced if only I had been given a fair hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">By way of illustration, I refer to a number of specific issues.  Many other issues are also in need of correction; this is for another day.  I refer to these illustrations for the sake of demonstrating that the opportunity to defend myself, my office and others was one of substance.  I do not appeal to fair procedures on the basis of some abstract principle.  Being afforded a fair hearing would have real implications.  I have been denied that opportunity by a pre-emptive assertion of no confidence.  In referring to constant and repeated misstatements and misunderstandings, I do so simply to illustrate why fair process is important, specifically when one is dealing with the holder of a constitutional office such as Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The impression has been created that I travelled very frequently to international events on the Government jet.  I have extracted the records in this regard.  While I was Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I was on 14 international flights on the Government jet over a five-year period.  The Government jet was not at my beck and call or for my personal pleasure.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">It is important to point out that accommodation is frequently arranged locally for a visiting Minister.  It is arranged by the hosts of an event one is attending or, alternatively, it is arranged by the relevant Department.  Some have said that I stayed in a hotel in Venice at a cost of €900 per night.  This is advanced as further evidence of extravagance.  In fact, a perusal of the records demonstrates that the cost of staying in the Best Western Albergo San Marco Hotel in Venice was €312.50 per room. Likewise, the cost of the Hotel Novotel Cannes Montfleury was €352.50 per room.  This is small detail that shows why making my case in its full detail was important.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The transfer between terminals at Heathrow was in accordance with standard protocol.  This is a long-established custom and practice whereby an incoming Minister is greeted by an embassy official.  My case was no exception.  It has happened on hundreds of occasions in the past to others who have held office.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">One of the most bizarre matters that has arisen relates to the sum of £1 on a hotel bill that has a charge imposed for the benefit of a charity.  The hotel bill was processed in the normal way and in accordance with standard procedures and the costs duly paid.  That hotel had an arrangement with the charity to make the payment of £1 in respect of guests staying in its accommodation.  Through an administrative error, when personal costs on the bill were charged to me, the charitable sum was omitted, but I never saw the bill.  I did not process it for payment.  I was not aware of the deduction and the arrangement between the hotel and the charity.  I did not claim back this £1.  To impute to me this level of petty meanness is extraordinary.  That again demonstrates the necessity for careful and detailed analysis of the costs incurred and why I have been wronged by a denial of fair procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">It has been suggested that I paid $520, and other amounts, in tips to limousine or taxi drivers.  That is simply untrue.  In certain countries, for example, the United States of America, a gratuity is automatically added.  In the case of a trip to the United States, a gratuity at a level of 20% was added.  The bill was processed through the consul in New York, paid and recouped from the Department.  A similar process applied to other jurisdictions.  I did not pay $520 by way of a tip.  The tipping arrangement is a standard procedure which was followed on those occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">A cost of €12,000 is attributed to me, as Ceann Comhairle, for car hire for a trip to Hong Kong while in transit.  In fact, the costs reported include the costs of officials and parliamentary delegates, that is, other Deputies and Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Any common sense view of my situation will recognise the particular representative functions which arise for being Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, and indeed Ceann Comhairle.  One attends events at home and abroad.  In attending international events, I want to emphasise that it was my function to represent and promote Ireland in many ways.  The goodwill and the networking that derives from these occasions benefit important industries in this State.  In this context, my period as Minister saw record increases in the number of tourists coming to Ireland.  I succeeded as well in providing invaluable assistance which attracted the Volvo Ocean Race, a stage of the World Rally Championship, and the Solheim Cup to Ireland.  These are worth millions of euro to our country.  Additionally, my attendance at international race meetings, where I promoted the Irish horse racing industry with Horse Racing Ireland, was of enormous benefit — as has been confirmed by that organisation — to an industry that employs over 16,000 people directly and indirectly, mainly in rural Ireland.  At international arts and cultural events which I managed to attend in an official capacity, I increased the standing and value of our arts and culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Whether in the areas of arts, sport or tourism, I tried to be out in the marketplace wherever it was important to be there.  Otherwise, we would have lost market share to our rivals, of whom there were and are plenty.  It must be recognised that in principle my attendance at such events give it the same nature as the presence for many decades of various Ministers at St. Patrick's Day events around the world.  The principle is the same but the occasion may be different.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">I also believe that some degree of proportionality is required.  When carefully analysed, one can see that the number of foreign events that I attended while an office holder is a minuscule percentage of all the events I attended.  Moreover, persons holding equivalent offices in other countries also attended such international events; that is the nature of such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">It is important to emphasise that during my period as an office holder I attended thousands of local and community events throughout the country.  I cannot think of a town or village which I did not visit at some stage.  I believed in what I was doing.  I committed myself to improving arts and sporting facilities in every town, village and parish where I could find the time and the funding to do so.  It would be a gross distortion and a deep injustice to me to suggest that my first allegiance, and my only allegiance, where the responsibilities of my Department were concerned lay anywhere but to the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I am proud of my contribution to Lansdowne Road to Tallaght stadium to Semple Stadium and countless other sporting facilities throughout the country.  I am also proud of my contribution to the National Convention Centre and the interpretative centre for the Cliffs of Moher and many other tourism facilities throughout the State.  I am also proud of my contribution to Wexford Opera House, the Abbey Theatre, the Gate Theatre, the Gaiety Theatre, Cork Opera House and up to 150 other arts and cultural projects across the land.  In short, I am proud that I fulfilled my mandate to the Irish taxpayer and to the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">It would be impossible for me to list all of the achievements of my Department during my tenure there in as much as it would be impossible to list all of our failures but let this much be said, where we failed it was never for the want of trying and when we succeeded it was because we never wanted to fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">On assuming office, and as agreed unanimously by the Oireachtas Commission at its meeting in November 2007, staffing levels for all officeholders were increased based on the workload of the respective offices.  Levels conformed to Department of Finance guidelines.  This included the retention in my office of a special adviser with responsibility for media and office liaison.  Moreover, the complement of office staff was on a par with one of my predecessors in the 1973 to 1977 Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">It has, as Members know, long been recognised that the Ceann Comhairle, as Chairman of Dáil Éireann, is the main representative of the Oireachtas, our Parliament, in the outside world and in its relations with other parliamentary institutions.  Foreign travel undertaken from the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Ceann Comhairle is either in response to an official invitation as Ceann Comhairle or in his capacity as Chairman of the Irish Parliamentary Association and as part of Ireland's obligations to be present at and to take part in Interparliamentary Union events.  Ireland has been a part of the Interparliamentary Union since 1928 and the Ceann Comhairle has represented the Houses of the Oireachtas and led interparliamentary delegations at foreign events since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">It is standard practice throughout the Interparliamentary Union that the speaker of a parliament is treated with the same level of courtesy as a Minister of Government.  Items of expenditure, including use of lounges, courtesy cars or security, are the customary courtesies we provide when we host an incoming parliamentary delegation to Ireland.  When the Ceann Comhairle travels abroad, the arrangements are made in keeping with whatever is recommended by the hosts, giving due regard to criteria such as security and proximity to the venues for conferences or meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">In the fullness of time, it will become apparent that many matters have been distorted and exaggerated beyond the bounds of fairness.  Simple techniques such as aggregating annual expenditures to produce headlines, attributing the costs of other persons expenditures to the officeholder personally, insinuating that routine decisions in respect of expenses on car hire or hotels were made or dictated by me, failing to acknowledge that many expenses flowed from well established patterns of official duties such as the St. Patrick's Day festival, maliciously suggesting that I attempted to reclaim charitable donations and excessive gratuities, conflation of accommodation charges and many others were used to create an ugly, grasping, black caricature of the man I am.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">As I depart from this office, it is appropriate that I give the benefit of my reflections.  I urge and admonish all of those in this House who aspire to hold constitutional office of the requirement to maintain constitutional fairness.  Transient political benefit will never be a compensation for long-term political damage.  The institutions of this State and the dictates of constitutional fairness are bigger than any individual, his or her political ambitions or his or her career.  I regret to say that I was not afforded the basic principles of a fair hearing.  Instead, the soundbite took the place of fairness.  The headline achieved was more enticing and politically compelling than the fairness of the process that ought to have been followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">If the elected Members of this House want to counter cynicism about the democratic process, the first step is to accord to each other a minimum quantum of fairness and reasonableness.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">That is so when those outside the House clamour loudest for their agendas to be preferred to the requirements of basic justice.  If that duty gives way to satisfying the needs and appetites of others outside the House, no amount of good work will restore confidence in our democratic institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I would have hoped to have been given an opportunity to answer each of the charges in a calm and reasonable forum.  I would have hoped that this House could have allowed me a few days to put my side of these events on the record.  However, patience in aid of fairness gave way, alas, to impatience to surf the political wave of competitive outrage.  Lest it be said that the failure to give me an opportunity to defend myself has somehow embittered me, I wish to acknowledge that the failure to afford me a right to be fairly heard arises from weakness rather than malice.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">I now leave this appointment in the knowledge that the Office of An Ceann Comhairle has been saved from further inappropriate political controversy.  That has been my principal concern and it is what commanded my silence to date.  There is some small satisfaction in that.  I also content myself in the knowledge that friend and foe alike have acknowledged that I have discharged my duties in a fair manner without fear or favour.  Denied my constitutional right to defend myself by a pre-emptive assertion of no confidence, I can only hope that the method by which my departure was contrived will be seen for what it is — a denial of due process.  This was a wrong done to the Office of Ceann Comhairle.  That it should have been perpetrated from the floor of this House bodes ill for the body politic.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I thank publicly my wife, Kate Ann, and family.  I also thank the Clerk of the Dáil, Kieran Coughlan, and his staff for the wonderful service they have given to me since June 2007.  I also thank my private secretary, Brendan Conroy, who has always worked above and beyond the call of duty, as well as his staff.  I also thank my personal staff for all their hard and diligent work over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">I take this opportunity to thank my friends and supporters in south Kerry and beyond.  I also thank Members of this House for the courtesy they have extended to me at all times.  I thank the staff of the House for their unfailing kindness.  Finally, to the men and women of the Fourth Estate, it has been the best of times and it has been the worst of times.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">I have had the great honour and privilege to serve in this House for almost 23 years.  I came into this House as an honest man and never asked anything of any man.  I never took anything from any man.  I never could and never would as to do otherwise would be to deny who I am and from whom I came.  Those who think otherwise do not know me and never will.  I will walk as proudly out of this Chair as the day I walked into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">In the end, one must be true to one's people and true to oneself, and I have been true to both.  Finally, while I may have been forced out of office by an unfair procedure, only the people of south Kerry have the right to exclude me from political life.  They have had a good opportunity to judge me, my standards and motives, as well as my commitment to this country for almost 23 years.  I now look forward to representing the interests of the constituents of Kerry South to the best of my ability.  Guím rath Dé oraibh go léir agus go deo.  Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">Ba mhaith liom an Teachta Séamus Ó Coirc a ainmniú chun bheith ina Cheann Comhairle.  I am pleased to nominate Deputy Seamus Kirk for the position of Ceann Comhairle.  Deputy Seamus Kirk was first elected to the House in November 1982 and has been returned to Dáil Éireann at every subsequent election by the people of Louth.  In almost 27 years as a Member of the House he has garnered much experience in the workings and nature of our parliamentary democracy.  He has a deep affinity for the House and its traditions.  Previously, Deputy Kirk served as a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  He has held the position of the chairman of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party since 2002.  Deputy Kirk is a man of great courtesy and quiet wisdom and I believe that is recognised on all sides of the House and I know he has the capacity and the abilities to do an outstanding job as Ceann Comhairle with fairness, impartiality and decorum.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">In making this nomination I wish to convey my thanks and good wishes to the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, Deputy John O'Donoghue.  Chairing the House is an arduous task and patience and perseverance are often required to ensure all voices, and not just the loudest, are heard.  All Members will agree that during his time as Ceann Comhairle Deputy O'Donoghue conducted our business in the Chamber with impeccable fairness and sound judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a glacadh arís leis an Teachta Seán Ó Donnchú as bheith ina Chathaoirleach cneasta agus cothrom ar an Teach seo.  Guím gach rath freisin ar an Teachta Séamus Ó Coirc.  Tá ard-mheas ar Shéamus mar pholaiteoir cumasach.  Creidim go mbeidh sé ina Cheann Comhairle stuama agus éifeachtach.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_43">As father of the House I wish to speak about the extraordinary circumstances in which we meet; the election of a Ceann Comhairle has never happened before in this way.  The revelations about the expenses and costs associated with the office of the previous Ceann Comhairle led to his resignation becoming inevitable.  Politics is always about people and in a profession which is devoid of sentiment and sympathy I have always held the belief that it should not be devoid of humanity or a sense of decency.  That is why I made no apology for setting out a process which would have allowed the previous Ceann Comhairle to state his position at the forum of the Dáil established for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">The principles that I set out still stand, even more so in respect of the appointment of a Ceann Comhairle to be made by the Dáil this afternoon.  Those principles are that the office is a constitutional office and should be seen to be above politics, should be above politics and there should not be any taint of politics associated with it.  For that reason, I made the point previously that where unwarranted expenses were paid to officeholders they should be paid back, and that principle should still apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Throughout the controversy the point I made was that this was endemic of a culture that has grown in this country through a party associated with power for too long.  The further revelations — not just in respect of the previous Ceann Comhairle but other officeholders — show that this cavalier attitude is not confined to one party in Government.  The role of the Ceann Comhairle is an important constitutional office, one that has been tarnished by recent events.  Today, we should be beginning the process of rebuilding public confidence in that office and in politics generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">Common sense should apply at all times and the costs and expenses associated with officeholders should be seen to be transparent and accountable in the interests of the public representatives and the public that they serve.  Prudence and common sense should apply at all times and if all of these costs and expenses are within the guidelines set out by the Department of Finance then where they are excessive those guidelines need to be revised.  They should be published and seen to be published so that nobody elected by the people to this House should be seen to be in any way associated with what is the public's deep-rooted anger about the body politic.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">We should be starting a new process here.  I believe that what happens in other parliaments, where the elected members decide by secret ballot who they want to be their speaker, should happen here.  It should not be seen as a continuation of more of the same.  With the greatest of respect to Deputy Kirk, whose integrity and work rate for his constituency in Louth for many years I cannot question, the fact remains he represents the chairmanship of his political party.  This, in the public mind, is not a change, a fresh or new beginning but more of the same.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">Deputy McGinley has represented the Donegal South-West constituency for the past 27 years.  He is a person of absolute integrity, a person who would fulfil this office with absolute distinction and acquit himself admirably in the duties assigned to him.  He is widely respected across politics and this House.  I know he has the commitment and the energy to lead and drive the necessary parliamentary reforms that are absolutely critical if this House is to make progress in dealing with the issues that afflict our nation and restore some sense of credibility, trust and integrity to the body politic.</p>

The Labour Party is not making any alternative proposal to the nomination of Deputy Kirk.  One of my colleagues, Deputy Howlin, holds the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It would be entirely inappropriate for a party which holds one of these offices to nominate one of its members for the other.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">We hold him in great respect.  He has been a long-standing Member of the House and will not be opposed in a partisan way by the Labour Party for the position of Ceann Comhairle.  I wish him well in the Office of Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the fairness with which Deputy O'Donoghue carried out his functions as Ceann Comhairle, something I have done previously.  I also want to take the opportunity to refer to some of the matters he raised in his valedictory address, lest they go unchallenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">In the course of that address, he effectively accused me of denying him fairness and of denying him a constitutional right of reply.  I did neither.  Since the beginning of the controversy over Deputy O'Donoghue's expenses, both in his capacity as a Minister and Ceann Comhairle, I refrained from making public comment about the issue out of the respect for which I hold for the Office of Ceann Comhairle.  I accepted the apology he gave to the House for the expenditures he incurred while a Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">When I did intervene in the controversy, last Sunday week, I acknowledged, first, Deputy O'Donoghue's fairness in the conduct of his duties as Ceann Comhairle and, second, that there are legitimate expenditures associated with the conduct of that and of any other office.  I also sought to have the issue dealt with on an all-party basis.  I did not deny him the right to address and make his case to the House.  What I did not agree with was that the appropriate forum for dealing with this matter was an in-house committee of this House which meets in private.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">The issue surrounding the controversy was a public matter that was being debated on the airwaves and discussed in public.  When we speak here about our constitutional roles, constitutional fairness and constitutional offices, we should remember one other constitutional function, namely, our primary constitutional function to represent the people who sent us here and to express, on the floor of our national Parliament, their opinions, their sentiments and their concerns.  We should remember that if the floor of this House is not to be the forum where we articulate the public's views, concerns and, at times, anger, then we will be failing in that primary constitutional duty, undermining the position of this House and the role of parliamentary democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">A Thaoisigh agus a chomh-Theachtaí, tá mé an-bhuíoch daoibh as an onóir mhór a bhronn sibh orm inniu agus mé a thogadh mar Cheann Comhairle ar Dáil Éireann.  Gabhaim buíochas ó chroí libh uilig.  Geallaim daoibh go ndéanfaidh mé mo dhícheall obair na Dála a riaradh de réir ardtraidisiún na hoifige, gradam na hoifige a chaomhnú agus cothram na féinne a thabhairt do gach Teachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">An Taoiseach and Members of Dáil Éireann, I value very highly the great honour you have conferred on me today by electing me as Chairman of Dáil Éireann and I thank you most sincerely for the honour.  I realise fully it is impossible to carry out the work of this office without the full co-operation of all Members and, because of this, I now humbly seek that co-operation.  I trust and, indeed, feel sure this co-operation will be readily forthcoming at all times from all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">My aim will be to carry out the work of the Chair in such a manner as to give full expression to all Members consistent with our Standing Orders and the due business of the House before us.  In seeking to uphold the best traditions of this House, I am mindful of my many illustrious predecessors.  It would be remiss of me if I did not mention, in particular, my immediate predecessors, two of whom are serving Members, Deputies Rory O'Hanlon and John O'Donoghue.  Both have made significant contributions to upholding the office of the Ceann Comhairle and the development of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  It is widely acknowledged by all sides of the House that Deputy O'Donoghue was a very good Ceann Comhairle and his easy style in the Chair, tinged with wit, found favour with all Members.  I might also mention that I am particularly proud, coming from the Louth constituency, to follow in the footsteps of a former Ceann Comhairle, Padraig Faulkner, who is more than 90 years of age and in good health.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I am by nature progressive and will readily embrace and faithfully implement any change to Dáil procedures made by Members to the Dáil reform sub-committee.  As incoming chair of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I look forward to continuing and encouraging further modernisation of the parliamentary administration within the current programme of cutbacks already adopted by the commission to ensure that the support services for the running of the House are of the highest standards in keeping with the best international practice and governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I must perform my first official duty as Ceann Comhairle.  In accordance with Standing Order No. 8 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, I wish to make the following declaration:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_229">I do solemnly declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and ability execute the office of Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann without fear or favour, apply the rules as laid down by this House in an impartial and fair manner, maintain order and uphold the rights and privileges of Members in accordance with the Constitution and the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann.</p>

On behalf of the Independent group, including Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Joe Behan, we are delighted that you have taken this position and we wish you well.  It is an important constitutional position, as many know.  In the debates, it is important that all Members of the Oireachtas and all views be respected.

I am a little envious that he is leaving it to Deputy Dermot Ahern, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd and myself to sweat it out at the next election while he can cosy through but that is part of the office.  I wish to assure him that I will look after his constituents as best I can</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I hope Deputy Kirk does not, as Ceann Comhairle, repeat the experience of his predecessors who sought to expel me from this Chamber on at least two occasions.  I will try to avoid that if I can.  I accept that maintaining order is an important part of the Ceann Comhairle's function.  I sincerely wish Deputy Kirk the  best of luck in the office and I look forward to working with him.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>

Ón aithne atá agam ort le blianta anuas, toghadh an bheirt againn sa bhliain chéanna.  We were both elected the same year; I happened to come to the House in February and the Ceann Comhairle in November.

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_253">The Governor of the Central Bank made a very significant statement today at the ESRI conference.  He said it is necessary to rebalance public spending and taxation by restoring the shares of taxation and spending in GNP to the levels which prevailed in the years running up to the turn of the millennium when the economy was growing along a sustainable path. The ESRI quarterly economic commentary gave very clear guidance with regard to the balance between taxation and spending savings in the upcoming budget.  It stated: "There are strong arguments for postponing any significant further tax increases until the worst of the recession is over".  Despite this, it clearly points out the growing gap between the Government's budgetary strategy and the advice given by Deputy Richard Bruton over the years in terms of getting the balance right between taxation increases and spending savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The most worrying event over the weekend was the approach taken by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan who took on the burdens of the nation and who told us they had agreed a survival programme for Government as distinct from a survival programme for the country.  The shambles of the deal that was done last weekend is shown clearly in the fact that we still do not know how much it is going to cost or, if listening to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, whether there is a deal done at all.  He is clearly of the view that in respect of third level fees that what was agreed at the weekend is only a temporary little arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">What is the cost of the deal agreed on Saturday between the Green Party and the Government?  What taxes will be increased or what services will be cut in order to meet it?  I am sure in the 70 hours of discussion chaired by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, these matters were discussed in some detail.  What services will be cut to pay for it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_45">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_256">Anyone with a cursory understanding of the current financial situation in the country will understand we have to operate within the budgetary and financial parameters set out by the Minister for Finance in respect of the budgets he has outlined to date and this will continue to be the case.  The Deputy refers to what the Governor of the Central Bank had to say today.  We must listen to the advice of the governor and take it into account.  He made the point he believes a credible convergence path is being embarked upon by Government to deal with the question of closing, over time, the deficit borrowing requirement which has opened up.  This has been reconfirmed in the newly agreed programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">In answer to the Deputy's questions, the priorities and initiatives that will be proceeded with and pursued by the Government, following the recent discussions we have had with our partners in Government, will operate under the same financial parameters which the Minister for Finance has already set out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_258">The Minister has changed his tune since April of this year when he set out his budgetary parameters.  For three days before the weekend we witnessed all the intrigue, hype and tension of the negotiations with allegations and rumours about this, that and the other.  Eventually, Ministers Dempsey and Ryan approached the podium to explain to a nation pent up with excitement or terror what this agreement was all about.  It is a pity we do not have a cost on this document and I will explain why.  On 30 September this year, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who went on the ferry to Holyhead, stated at a press conference, "You cannot have a document which is not costed.  It has to be costed and it will be".  The Taoiseach has signed off on a deal, he has them in the lair now for the period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">From our perspective we have carried out a preliminary calculation of the tax implications of this new deal.  Based on those estimates, the ordinary family will have to foot an increased tax hike of €2.5 billion.  Where will the money come from to pay for the announcements in this new deal?  Fine Gael has repeatedly pointed out that no country has ever taxed its way back to prosperity.  All the pronouncements that the Minister for Finance has been making since April now seem to be thrown out the window simply to keep the Government on board.  What is the calculation of the cost here?  Is it €2.5 billion on the tax side?  Will the Taoiseach outline who will pay for the 500 extra teachers over three years referred to?  Are they to be appointed to the detriment of the appointment of nurses, gardaí and other front line public services that our people so desperately need?</p>
        </speech>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_260">Deputy Kenny is being disingenuous as usual.  The fact is the tax initiatives contained in the programme are about rebalancing our tax system to keep taxes on labour as low as possible.  They require a good deal of preparatory work and will be implemented over the lifetime of the Government.  Some initiatives will be undertaken in that timeline too.  It is important to point out the removal of the PRSI ceiling as proposed in the programme does not constitute a new tax.  It is proposed to change the existing tax which would be redistributive in effect.  The revised programme states the change would be introduced in parallel with the reduction of the temporary income levy.  Basically, we are setting out the objectives and direction of tax policy.  I would take with a pinch of salt any preliminary costings of the Fine Gael Party.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_261">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about one of the measures included in the renewed programme for Government, that is, the proposal or the intention to introduce or reintroduce water charges.  The programme states that it is intended to introduce charging for treated water use on the basis of a basic free allowance provided to each household and then to charge for water in excess of use above that allowance.  This would obviously require the metering of water in individual households.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if there is any estimate for the cost of metering every house in the country?  When the Leas Cheann-Comhairle was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a cost was carried out which at the time amounted to approximately £1 billion.  This was the estimated total cost to meter every house in the country.  Has any costing been carried out on the metering of every house or dwelling into provide for water charges?</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Has any consideration been given to what the basic level of water allowance would be that would apply to each house?  How much is it intended would be raised by charging for water?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_49">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_263">It is important to point out that advancing the programme for Government commitment requires further detailed consideration over the coming period and a range of important issues must be addressed.  No definitive or detailed framework for the implementation of the commitment can be spelled out at this point.  The final approach will be the subject of a Government decision on the basis of detailed proposals which must be worked up.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The policy considerations relate to the need for legislation to give effect to a commitment which must be examined.  The operational cost for local authorities to provide water and waste water services in 2007 was €680 million and the estimated cost in 2008 was €730 million.  A public information campaign may be required to outline the rationale for water metering and how it would be implemented.  The Commission on Taxation, which recommended the introduction of domestic water charges, recommended a public information campaign that would explain the rationale for water charges and how they would be introduced.  Local authorities will need to gather information on the identity and location of domestic customers and ensure their billing systems are accurate.  It will be necessary also to work out an established waiver scheme for low income householders.  The development of a water charges waiver system and the necessary implementation arrangements for such a system would require careful consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The whole purpose is to try to provide a prospect where, over time, we can find the means by which we can pay for the provision of water and waste water treatment, which is very considerable, on an annual basis.  I do not have the details to hand but the Deputy may ask the line Minister in respect of any particular estimates regarding the provision of water metering in every household if it were proceeded with.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">It is also important to refer to the whole question of the waste currently taking place because people are not charged a basic minimum because of loss of water in the system, which cost a good deal of money to the taxpayer as it stands.  The revised programme refers to introducing charging for treated water use that is fair, that significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  That is the detailed work that must now be proceeded with.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_50">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_267">I do not see where it raises money if one must meter every dwelling.  The national household survey indicates there are 1.9 million dwellings in the country now.  It could cost the guts of €2 billion to meter them.  What level of water charge would be necessary to raise money if one has to spend almost €2 billion metering them in the first place and if, as the Taoisech indicated, there will only be a charge after a certain minimum allowance is granted and there is to be a waiver system?</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that the Government will not introduce a flat water charge in advance of metering and in advance of putting in place a minimum water allowance for every household and the waiver system to which he referred?  One concern with this proposal is that we could be informed in six or 12 months time that the cost of metering is very high, that there are practical difficulties associated with the allowance and that the Government would go ahead with the introduction of a flat water charge.  Will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that there will not be a flat water charge and that this will not be progressed until the metering is done, the allowances are set and a waiver system is put in place?</p>

The policy consideration must take account of the fact that in the absence of any incentive or disincentive effect in terms of the use, we see a good deal of water wasted and used disproportionately in certain households compared to others.  We must find a means to address this given that last year it cost approximately €730 million to provide water and waste water facilities in the country.  That is a significant charge on the taxpayer and on local authorities and we must find a means to address this in a fair and proportionate way and in a way that takes account of variations of circumstance.  We must ensure that indiscriminate use regardless of amount by one household <i>vis-à-vis</i> another is something that must be dealt with as a policy matter. It is something that must be examined by the Government, and it will be examined by the Minister.  We are outlining in the policy the direction of our intentions.</p>

The airline has already failed to sign up to the new state-of-the-art US pre-clearance facility and there is now a serious threat over transatlantic services from Shannon as a result of these proposals.  The New York service will be reduced to three flights weekly.  Any diminution of Aer Lingus transatlantic services from Shannon will have serious implications for business and tourism sectors in the region, which are already under pressure during these difficult times.  The Minister for Transport must intervene and use the Government's 25% shareholding in the airline to ensure daily US connectivity to the mid-west region.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I wish to raise three items on the Order of Business.  First, the House will agree with me that we should formally express our sympathy on the death of two Air Corps pilots, Captain Derek Furniss from Ballinteer and Cadet David Jevens from Wexford.  I know the location where the Pilatus aircraft came down and it is very rugged country.  This is a tragedy for their families.  It remains to be seen how the investigative teams will attempt to discover what happened in this case.  It is a tragedy for two young men who were training and being trained in the line of duty for the State.  I sympathise with their families and friends on their loss.  It is a tragic accident that nobody wished to see and I am sure the House will join with me in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Second, I ask the Taoiseach to arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to provide the House with an update on the situation concerning attempts to obtain the release in the Philippines of Fr. Michael Sinnott from Wexford.  This man was carrying out his priestly duties and has a medical history that is of some concern.  I know the Taoiseach will be anxious that Fr. Sinnott is released safely as quickly as possible through the efforts of our ambassador and whatever other contacts the Government may have in the region.  I say that in the context of another Irish person, Sharon Commins, who was abducted along with her co-worker in Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Third, in respect of the National Asset Management Agency Bill, I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that no guillotine will apply to the discussion of amendments on Committee Stage.  It is complicated legislation and Members, in addition to those on the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, will wish to contribute to the debate on Committee Stage.  I hope the Taoiseach will advise the chairman of the select committee that there should not be a guillotine on that Stage of the Bill.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_282">As regards the tragedy yesterday evening, at its meeting this morning the Government, through the Minister for Defence, conveyed its sincere sympathy to the bereaved families.  Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time.  The necessary investigations are being proceeded with and the results will be brought forward in due course.  In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, our thoughts are with the families of the deceased.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">As regards the abduction of Fr. Sinnott, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is travelling to the United States today.  He was unable to undertake the visit in September during the course of the referendum campaign, but he is now doing so.  Regardless of that, however, I assure the House that the Department and the Minister are doing all they can, working through the experienced diplomatic personnel who are dealing with that case, in order to see how we can assist in bringing about the safe return of Fr. Sinnott.  The other case in Darfur, concerning Ms Sharon Commins, is also a matter of top priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Deputy will be aware that the NAMA legislation will be dealt with in a similar fashion to the Finance Bill.  Various sections are taken together so that all aspects of the Bill are examined over a period.  I understand the Government Chief Whip will be bringing a motion before the House on that issue imminently.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I want to ask the Taoiseach about the date of the budget.  The House has not yet been told the date of the budget.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_288">I gathered as much from the reports over the weekend.  The well-informed sources reported in the newspapers were obviously better informed than the House.  There is one normal sitting day after Wednesday, 9 December, which is usually taken up by speeches from the Taoiseach and other party leaders in response to the budget.  That leaves one week before Christmas to debate the budget.  This is a very short period of time in which a budget can be debated.  It is particularly short given the advance billing this particular budget is getting.  The current date for the House to rise is 17 December.  Are there plans to change the number of days we sit before Christmas in order that the House would at least have a reasonable opportunity to debate the budget?  This has all the hallmarks of getting the budget done as close as possible to Christmas and out of here as fast as possible in order that people will forget what is in it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_64">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_289">That is not the situation.  First, I understand the Minister for Finance has to attend an ECOFIN meeting on 1 and 2 December.  As the Deputy will be aware, many important issues are taking place at European level.  The following week is the best time to take the budget and it is the right time to take it.  Second, the debate in the House will not end before or immediately after Christmas.  It is a matter for the House to decide the detail in that regard.  Third, it is important that there would be a good debate in the House in advance of the budget to address the issues and serious challenges that confront us as a country.  For example, the publication of the pre-budget outlook could provide an opportunity for a full debate in the House in early November.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">With regard to the NAMA Bill, did the Taoiseach suggest that the arrangements for the basement debate on Committee Stage as opposed to a debate on the floor of the House on probably the most significant financial measure, where his Government proposes to overpay for assets by at least €7 billion, will follow those in place for the Finance Bill whereby blocks of time are devoted to groupings of sections?  That is different from not imposing a guillotine because, for example, the critical part of the Bill dealing with long-term economic value comprises a number of sections around section 70.  If the debate is broken into blocks of time, it could mean there will be no opportunity to debate the mechanism by which we overpay for long-term economic value, depending on where sections in the late 60s and the 70s come.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">With regard to having the debate on the floor of the House, has the Government decided that this important debate will be held in a basement committee room?</p>

          <p eId="para_306">I understand the urgency but, whatever arrangements are put in place, we must have an opportunity to discuss the important sections and I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that this happens.  We cannot have an allocation of time motion that results in a debate on the first two items in the allocation while everything else is lost.  There needs to be consensus across the floor to provide an opportunity to debate this legislation fairly and properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I welcome the opportunity to have a pre-budget debate but on what basis will we have such a debate?  Ministers had to list by 11 September the items in the McCarthy report they would implement.  Will that list be available for the pre-budget debate signalled by the Taoiseach in order that we can have a genuine debate about the choices proposed by Ministers and other choices that could be proposed?  Will the Government provide the so-called no policy change Estimates, which are meaningless in the current climate?  They are useless and meaningless as a tool to assist debate.  If the Taoiseach wants a sensible debate, it cannot be on the tried and tested method.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dick Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_330">Rather than reading out, as Ministers do, a speech praising our side and criticising the Opposition side, it struck me that we might, for a change, consider what people are saying.  Like most Members of this House I have received hundreds of e-mails recently and I have tried to engage in a dialogue, through the e-mail system, with my constituents and with people from far and wide who have concerns about this issue.  Many people have deep concerns about the National Asset Management Agency, as they have about the banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The questions that arises time and again are: Why do we need NAMA, and why not let the market visit its vengeance upon those in the banking system and in the development world who behaved in a profligate manner?  The answer to those questions is simple.  To protect jobs we need an economy that is growing and an economy cannot grow without a functioning banking system.  Whatever views we might individually have about the people who have been at the top of the banking system, and, like many people, I am very angry about the manner in which they operated, everybody is agreed that we must address the health and stability of the banking system before we can start making progress.  Risky loans in our banking system are restricting the flow of credit, as we all know, and there is no credit for ordinary business people in every part of the country.  I was in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency and people were talking in the streets about this very issue, to the effect that the banking system is not functioning, credit is not flowing and people are suffering as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Irish banks rely heavily on financial institutions abroad for funding but the scale of the losses in banking would make this liquidity more difficult and therefore make the entire process of recovery more difficult.  It would also make borrowing and interest rates much more costly.  In addition, if banks remain unsure about the losses that will eventually result from these loans, the nervousness about the adequacy of the capital that will provide future credit will not be dispelled and future credit will not be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The asset management approach is not an entirely new approach, which many people appear to believe.  It is an approach that has a track record.  By establishing the National Asset Management Agency Ireland can tackle head-on the significant threat that impaired assets pose to the Irish financial system.  The establishment of NAMA has been supported by the European Union Commission, and we all heard Commissioner Almunia express his views in recent days.  It has also been supported by respected institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.  I make this point simply to emphasise that the commentary to the effect that this is a sinister attempt to bail out bankers or, worse still, to bail out developers and <i>habitués</i> of a tent in Galway does not add to the debate and is doing something of a disservice to the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The financial markets have already responded positively to NAMA.  The question that arises is how it will operate.  That question has been asked time and again in e-mails and messages to me, the Members opposite and every other Member of the House.  As I said, the idea is not a new approach.  NAMA will buy land, development property loans and certain associated loans from the banks at prices that are well under the current book values of those loans.  NAMA will start with the largest systemic exposures across the institutions and it is expected that by the middle of next year, most of those loans will be transferred.  The system can then start getting itself back to normal.  NAMA will leave behind smaller, cleaner and better funded banks that can focus their resources on their core function of lending to a productive economy.  I would hope that at that time we can also start talking about real regulation that will ensure we do not go back to where we came from.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The most common assertion is that NAMA is a way of bailing out greedy bankers, and it is understandable that members of the public should have that view.  People who have been treated less than respectfully by banks would be less than human if they did not wish to visit their wrath upon bankers and banking institutions.  The reality, however, is that the majority of people who work in the banking system were not responsible for the current position.  There was a core at the top, and there is no doubt there was a rotten culture there, but we cannot visit our wish for revenge on every member of the banking fraternity, nor can we visit it upon everybody who has made investments in banks over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">NAMA will not be permitted to operate as a bailout mechanism for anybody, and certainly not for anybody who has behaved or operated irresponsibly.  The important point, which is repeated time and again but lost sight of in the shouting and hectoring, is that NAMA will treat those who took out those development loans and related loans as borrowers who will continue to have the full amount of their loan due for payment.  They will have a duty to maximise taxpayers' returns.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Nor is NAMA a builders' bailout, as is often suggested in the heat of political debate.  The complaints by the Construction Industry Federation suggest that NAMA is not seen by it as a bailout.  Recent well publicised comments by a leading developer attest to that.  NAMA has been designed to ensure a properly functioning financial system, with funds available to lend to sustainable businesses.  A properly functioning system will provide access to credit for completion of worthwhile projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Whether the banks are getting off scot free is another issue which has exercised the minds of many people but they are not getting away scot free.  The legislation includes a risk-sharing mechanism that will protect the taxpayer from overpayment of assets to be transferred to NAMA.  The legislation also provides that if NAMA should make a loss in any given year, it will have the option of not paying any interest or coupon payment on the debt concerned.  That is a provision we should all welcome but I do not believe it has been properly debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">In addition, there is the question of the levy.  I am pleased the Minister for Finance has made it clear that a levy will be introduced purely as a precautionary measure.  The levy is the final insurance that the taxpayer will not be visited with the costs of profligate behaviour by bankers or builders.  Although it is not expected that the levy will have to be used, if it does have to be used, it will ensure that the taxpayers do not pick up the full cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I was surprised recently by the comments of Professor Joseph Stiglitz, the distinguished American economist and Nobel prize winner from a number of points of view.  Although I am familiar with his work, I regard any economist coming from the United States where there was such an extraordinary meltdown, making the comments that he made — the suggestion that it should be just left to the market to clear up matters — as proposing a very odd approach.  Anybody who is conscious of the recent experience of US finances, particularly in the money markets, would not reasonably come to the conclusion that letting the market take its course is the best solution.  All we have to do is reflect on what happened in the case of Lehman Brothers.  Lehman Brothers was allowed to collapse because that is what the market dictated but the reality is that the cost of letting Lehman Brothers go has run to trillions of dollars.  I am not sure that many people with the benefit of hindsight would argue that was necessarily the best approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The important point is that NAMA will not pay above the odds for impaired loans.  That was part of Professor Stiglitz's argument.  The European Commission would not allow NAMA to overpay for assets as it would be a violation of EU state aids.  That does not mean that NAMA will pay only current market values which, under current stress market positions, would imply fire sale values because a fire sale would not be the best approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">In citing the comments of people from outside this country, people have conveniently overlooked what Ben Bernanke has had to say.  He had a distinguished record in the Federal Reserve.  He made the point that a fire sale approach to assets in the distressed banking system is not the best way forward.  In fact, he suggested that it was a mistake.  Like other governments around the world, we reject the idea of forcing distressed assets to be unloaded on to a market that simply cannot handle them.  That is the reason the EU framework is more supportive of the NAMA approach.  The European Central Bank has said that the allowance for long-term economic value should not be unduly large but it favours the long-term economic value approach.  Logically, it is the only approach that can be adopted.  The estimated cost of the long-term economic approach by NAMA is €7 billion, as has been repeatedly pointed out by Deputy Burton.  NAMA will have to achieve less than 10% of an uplift over a decade to cover that cost and that point has not been factored into the debate.  The Central Bank has indicated that the allowance "does not seem out of proportion with the range of potential upward price movements, especially when a risk-shared element is included".</p>
          <p eId="para_343">There are measures that will mitigate the risks to the taxpayers which are worth repeating.  First, there will be a part-payment in the form of subordinated debt.  Second, payments will only be made if NAMA is making a profit.  Third is the level of State ownership, as the State already has warrants equating to 25% of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, and it fully owns Anglo Irish Bank.  There are also building and mutual societies involved.  In view of this the taxpayer has a substantial stake in the agencies being supported.  There is also the issue of the levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The common good is not served by trying to avoid unpopular political decisions.  The argument made here and outside this House that we can simply walk away from this is not based on any economic analysis.  The reality is we cannot do that and we must deal with the issue, whether we like it or not.  If we have views about banking and builders and whatever they are, the matter must be faced as the common good of the country requires a return to economic growth.  Such growth will only come about if we can create a banking system that will have credit flows.  The NAMA approach seems to be the best and most viable approach to creating credit flows and helping viable businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">One of the most contentious issues in the e-mail traffic we have all received is the question of valuations.  The basic premise for the valuation framework is that NAMA is paying significantly less than the book values of the loans — some €54 billion compared to a book value of €77 billion.  That represents an estimated aggregate discount of 30%.  The point must be made that the final figures are not to be established until we have had the analysis of each individual loan.  The estimated market value of the loans currently stands at €47 billion, and this is based on certain assumptions and information about the property market, including a fall in average property values in the State of approximately 50% since the peak at 2007.  That is not an unrealistic assumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The current estimate of the allowance for the long-term economic value is €7 billion, and each loan must be valued individually.  Each loan, including the value of collateral and securities associated with it, will require a separate valuation once the Act has commenced, so the final figure may be different from the €7 billion figure which has been repeated so often and stridently, particularly by Deputy Burton.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">As each loan must be valued individually in accordance with valuation methodology, the estimate of the price to be paid for the assets which is being broadcast and which has been used in the debate so far is provisional.  Not a single cent will be paid for a loan until it has been subject to a thorough due diligence examination.  The ultimate value to be paid is defined with regard to EU guidance on the long-term economic value.  It is worth putting these issues on the record because there has been a misinformed public debate.  It is easy to understand why this has come about because there have been strident arguments put forward without much logic applied to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Another question which is posed in many people's minds, and going back to Professor Stiglitz, is the fire sale solution.  Why not force the banks to sell their assets for whatever they can get?  We might feel that this is what the banks are due and that it would wreak a sense of retribution on the banks from a scenario they have themselves created.  Our individual feelings about the banks should not determine what is in the long-term public interest and a fire sale simply would not be in this interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Forcing the holders of loans to sell assets at prices below those at which they could rationally expect to realise in the near future would not mend a banking system that is seriously broken; the opposite is the case as it would dig an even greater hole.  Such an arrangement would not put our financial system back on track and would upset it even further.  As has already been mentioned, we must address the health and stability of the banking sector if we are to get the economy moving again.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Letting the market take its course would worsen an already bad position and that is why I am surprised that any group of economists in this country or elsewhere would line up behind this view.  Using unsubordinated bonds puts the banks at risk if NAMA were to lose money, which is not our expectation, and approximately 5% of the total consideration will be in the form of subordinated bonds.  The levy will also be in place so the interests of the taxpayer are very well protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">In the context of the risks taken by the taxpayer, it is interesting to address the question of the valuation and what is required for the taxpayer to break even on NAMA.  If we take the subordinated debt into account, it is estimated NAMA would have to achieve an uplift of less than 10% over the current market values of the assets over ten years to break even.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I canvassed in an estate recently with the Acting Chairman in Tallaght.  It is an estate with which I have a personal affinity and I remember in a previous distressed time when houses in it changed hands for £4,000 or £5,000.  The Acting Chairman knows as well as I that even in the current distressed market 20 years later, the houses are significantly more valuable than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Under the NAMA proposals, it is reasonable to suggest that a 10% uplift over the current market figures in a ten-year period is achievable.  From experience, I cannot believe anybody would argue that this will not happen.  Considering what has happened in that estate in Tallaght over 25 years since it was built, including the peaks and troughs, over a ten-year period it was easy to achieve a 10% uplift.  If a 10% uplift on property values is achieved or prices kept pace with the general rate of inflation, the taxpayer would be insulated.  There is no assumption built into the NAMA proposition — it is important to say as much — that peak property prices will or must be achieved.  It would be economically irrational to make such a presumption and it is not in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">There is also the Labour Party proposition.  Why not simply nationalise the banks and bring all of them into public ownership?  The full nationalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, which is what the proposal amounts to, has been ruled out on the basis of information which has come to us through due diligence and stress test exercises undertaken in March on the State's purchase of preference shares in the banks.  Other information on expected future bank losses indicates that full nationalisation is not necessary and would be unhelpful in reconstructing some sense of support or confidence in the Irish banking system in the medium and long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">It is not helpful to continue debating the idea that all the banks are basket cases that must be nationalised.  Once an institution is totally nationalised, the State must sustain it, as we have seen this in the case of Anglo Irish Bank.  If there was no directly criminal activity in that case, some of those involved operated with criminal intent and a cavalier disregard for moral behaviour as bankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The State must ensure the minimum capital would be maintained in an institution.  If that is not done, the institution ceases to be a bank and all the liabilities become an immediate charge on the State and therefore on the taxpayer.  The concept that nationalisation would somehow or other make this problem go away is not based on logic.  If Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland were to be fully nationalised, the shareholder would have to be compensated, unless we decided to steal the assets that exist for shareholders.  Such shareholders are not all fat cats; many thousands of unfortunate people invested their life savings in those banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">At current share prices, this would amount to a €5 billion cash payout before a single cent of new capital could be injected.  Where would that money come from?  The Labour Party has not said where this additional capital could be found.  New injections of State capital would have to be borrowed on world markets at interest rates of at least 5%.  NAMA bonds will pay much lower interest than that.  The cost of the NAMA proposition is significantly lower than the cost of the Labour Party nationalisation proposition.  Full nationalisation would inevitably result in Ireland's sovereign credit rating also being downgraded.  I have never heard Deputy Burton or any of her colleagues factor this into the debate, and yet it is an element not only affecting State borrowing but which would have a knock-on effect for every taxpayer in the country.  If we are to engage in a logical debate on NAMA and nationalisation, we should proceed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">For a party whose members have a long tradition in and who have made a very respected contribution to business, I am surprised that Fine Gael would suggest that we follow the example of Lehman Brothers and simply default on our debts.  That model has nothing to commend it, nor has the idea of a magic bank.  Fine Gael's propositions in this area are premised on significant levels of default by Irish banks.  The party's proposition in respect of a wholesale bank is that the State would inject €2 billion in capital in such an institution and that on the basis of this money — having already defaulted on our debts — would effectively borrow a further €40 billion.  With respect, the figures put forward in this regard simply do not add up.  I am of the view that a legacy bank, which is another proposition offered by Fine Gael, would have ruinous repercussions for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Rather than putting forward propositions that are unworkable, we should focus our efforts — I hope this will be done on Committee Stage — on making NAMA work.  NAMA is a proposition that is fundamentally sound.  I have never suggested that all wisdom resides on this side of the House.  Such a claim would be arrogant nonsense, particularly in view of the fact that it is not the case.  There are people on all sides of the House who, from an economic perspective, have good contributions to make.  Rather than chasing chimeras or shadows — which is the basic nature of the propositions put forward by the two main Opposition parties — we should pool our resources to ensure that NAMA works.  This should not be done from the point of view of vindicating a position adopted by the Government but rather from a recognition that it is the correct action to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">This is the first opportunity I have had to address the House in the aftermath of the recent referendum.  Obviously, I am extremely pleased on a personal level with the result thereof.  Fine Gael and Labour showed real and practical patriotism in respect of the referendum campaign.  I informed the leaders of those parties and their spokespersons on the matter of that fact in private.  NAMA is also an issue on which practical patriotism could also be shown.  If we pool our resources, we will make the NAMA proposition work.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  This is probably one of the most important debates that will take place during the lifetime of this Dáil.  In fact, it is probably one of the most important in the history of the State.  In years to come people such as I, who are fortunate to be Members of the House, will probably be asked how we voted  on NAMA.  This debate will probably rank with the treaty debates or some of the great debates that were held at the beginning of the Second World War.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The enactment of this Bill will have economic and financial repercussions for future generations.  What we are doing is transferring almost unlimited billions to the banks and financial institutions.  What is being done constitutes a direct transfer of money from the current and future generations of Irish taxpayers to the institutions which have contributed so much to bringing us to the edge of financial ruin and national bankruptcy.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">For centuries, our banks were looked upon as being institutions of probity, security, responsibility and conservatism.  They looked after our savings — those of us who had any — in a prudent manner.  They financed our home mortgages, supported domestic purchases and, in particular, supported business and enterprise — the engines of our economic development.  The banks always acted in the interests of their shareholders and investors and were considered to be solid and reliable pillars of our economy and our nation and were a symbol international financial status.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">It is generally agreed that banks are a necessity for a thriving economy.  They provide the credit that is an absolute necessity for business and industry to operate successfully and to thrive.  Today, however, Irish banks are unable to provide such support because some of them are already bankrupt, while others are on the verge of bankruptcy.  We need not dwell at length on the reasons our financial institutions have arrived at this juncture.  Suffice to say that in recent years they were sucked into the property bubble and formed an alliance with developers in order to inflate an unsustainable boom.  All of this was tolerated and at times orchestrated and encouraged by an indulgent Government which failed miserably to employ proper regulation and supervision.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">That which I describe was at best an unholy alliance and at worst a conspiracy between the Government, the banks and the developers, who are responsible for transforming Ireland from a booming first world economy to the economic basket case of Europe and the developed world.  For some years, we had a first world economy but, unfortunately, we also had a Third World Administration.  On many occasions in recent years we were informed by responsible Members of this House and similar individuals outside it that we had the best economy and highest <i>per capita</i> incomes in the world, that Ireland was the richest country in the world, etc.  However, it was all built on sand.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Over a period of years we were continually informed that property was the "only game in town".  That phrase almost became a cliché.  I become afraid when I hear something being referred to as the only game in town.  Anyone who disagreed with the assertion to which I refer was accused of talking down the national interest and being out of step with the national consensus.  That consensus was comprised of the developers, the banks, the Government and even the national media.  During the period to which I refer, the property supplements of national newspapers were bigger and more widely read and studied than the news or sports sections of those same newspapers.  Like the Government, the newspapers were also making huge profits on the building and property boom.  It was, therefore, in their interests to keep the boom going and to talk it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The Taoiseach's immediate predecessor suggested that those who questioned the bubble should commit suicide.  That was unbelievable.  Nevertheless, a number of economists such as David McWilliams, Professor Morgan Kelly, our own recently recruited colleague, Deputy Lee, and even Alan Aherne — who addressed a Fine Gael conference in Galway three years ago — forecast that the bubble would burst.  However, these individuals were dismissed as being at best eccentric or at worst irresponsible.  It is now time to see who was right.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">How could anyone justify the building of 90,000 dwellings per annum in a country of just over 4 million inhabitants when the UK — the population which is 12 to 15 times greater than that of Ireland — was building only 140,000 to 160,000?  If the UK had been obliged to match Ireland on a <i>per capita</i> basis during the period in question, the authorities there would have needed to build over 1 million houses per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">During the period to which I refer, banks were allowing people to borrow ten to 12 times their annual income in order to purchase houses and apartments that were inferior and the prices of which were inflated.  As a result, many young people who purchased in recent years find themselves in negative equity and are paying for houses that are currently valued at less than half the purchase price.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">This is the financial millstone we have tied around the necks of thousands of young couples.  That millstone was created by three guilty parties.  Everyone recalls the national madness that saw hundreds of people sleeping for days and nights outside nearly or newly completed housing schemes in order to be the first to purchase.  We also recall the unscrupulous practice of builders and sellers in increasing purchase prices overnight.  How many times did we hear the word "gazumping" during that period?  Gazumping was another despicable practice of the boom but no one refers to it now.  It is those who encouraged the practice of gazumping that we are going to bail out.  It is these people that NAMA is designed to cater for.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Members will recall the conspiracy whereby sellers, in cahoots with banks and other lending institutions, estimated the amount a person could borrow and settled the price accordingly.  Such an amount bore no relation to cost or value for money and represented criminal exploitation in the first degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Then one comes to NAMA, which is designed to bail out the same institutions and developers that have plunged us to the verge of national bankruptcy.  Members are being asked to accept a formula devised by those who largely created the mess and which could cost taxpayers up to €90 billion.  One is told this is the only show in town and one then hears that in the main, builders and bankers are in favour.  Their support alone is enough to send shudders through a society that has been brought to its knees by the greed of both sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Once again, people are being told this is the only game in town.  Where has one heard that cliché before?  At the height of the property boom; it is true that history repeats itself.  Anyone who questions NAMA is talking down the national interest or is out of step etc. and I have heard it all before.  While the Government unfortunately does not appear to be learning from recent economic history, many independent economists and academics have done so.  It is difficult to find an economist who is outside the Government loop and who supports NAMA.  They see it for what it is, namely, a huge bailout for those who have brought us to this tragic situation.  It is significant that all the commentators who are in favour represent the banks and financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Irish banking is a big business and in recent years has been cursed by a culture of cronyism that has bordered on being financially incestuous.  The same faces keep coming out of the woodwork repeatedly.  It is a case of your joining my board, my joining your board, our joining his board and their joining our board, as the same faces come up continually.  Their conduct usually is epitomised by sharp practices, shady deals, financial shortcuts, inside dealing and highly unorthodox financial shenanigans.  Due to a lack of regulations and supervision, much of this is overlooked.  Actions that would land one in jail in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, are tolerated and overlooked in this little country.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">We now are in the process of handing over countless billions to these institutions.  I understand that one of the most notorious of such institutions, Anglo Irish Bank, is being earmarked for €28 billion.  This is a bank that probably never sanctioned a mortgage to a house purchaser in all its existence.  How many of these billions will percolate to the ordinary borrower or business man or to the entrepreneur trying to create or even save a few jobs?  The answer is nothing; not a single euro.  Nevertheless, it is stated that this is the only game in town.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The principle on which NAMA is based is utterly crazy.  We are being asked to buy property not at market value but at what it may be worth in five to ten years time.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">I thank the Acting Chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">During these difficult economic times, when people are finding themselves in situations they never imagined, such as being unemployed, fighting to keep their homes or struggling to survive on social welfare benefits, hope and optimism is what keeps everyone going.  One hopes the Government will do everything in its power to help this country climb out of recession.  One hopes that those who got us into this mess will be brought to justice and one hopes the mistakes of the past will never be repeated.  However, the Government's proposed National Asset Management Agency fills me not with hope but with dread.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">I have tried hard to make sense of what has happened in Ireland in recent years and of how the Government plans to rescue the economy.  However, it now is clear to me that NAMA is not the answer.  It simply constitutes another example of the Government's mismanagement, which will have serious consequences for all.  It is beyond belief that the Government intends to pay €54 billion for €77 billion worth of toxic loans, which actually is €7 billion more than they are worth, in the hope of making a good return.  NAMA will be greatly dependent on the property market bouncing back but there is no guarantee this will work and there are no guarantees that NAMA will not bankrupt the country.  NAMA is a huge gamble on the part of the Government and the taxpayer will be obliged to foot a bill that is the equivalent of €34,000 for each household.  This is the reason I cannot and will not support NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">When the present Government was formed in 2007, the future looked quite bright for Ireland.  However we became greedy and many people lived beyond their means.  When the global downturn struck, people were not equipped to deal with it.  There were no provisions for a rainy day, no savings in the coffers and no way back from gross overspending and investment in bricks and mortar.  Although the property bubble carried us a long way, it then burst and left thousands of people with homes they could not afford and mortgages they could not pay back.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I am genuinely saddened that so many young people who stepped excitedly onto the property ladder now struggle with huge mortgage repayments on homes that are in negative equity.  People were bombarded by the banks offering 100% mortgages and overdrafts and it seemed as though money really grew on trees.  We now have one of the highest proportions of mortgage debt in the euro zone.  During the years of the Celtic tiger, property prices rose continually and houses sold at hugely inflated prices.  Although deep down we knew this would never be sustainable, that was ignored and suddenly it was all over.  Thousands have lost their jobs and now rely on social welfare benefits or seek help from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Recent figures show that 27% of MABS clients are experiencing problems in making their mortgage payments, which constitutes an increase from a figure of 18% in 2006.  Many also are finding it hard to repay personal loans, credit card bills and even household bills.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which has a long and proud tradition in Ireland of helping those in need, faces new challenges in helping individuals and families who are sinking beneath heavy debts.  In many cases, it also is helping people who are struggling with depression and suicide brought on by the stress and fear of losing their homes or being unable to survive financially.  In the face of the current unemployment rate of 12.6%, many people face difficult times and for them there is no easy way out.  They will carry the burden of huge debt for many years.  Moreover, for those who simply cannot meet their mortgage repayments, repossession is a real fear.  Repossession orders rose by more than 100% last year and the banks now have thousands of repossessed properties on their books of which they cannot rid themselves.  Common sense is called for in respect of this problem.  As the banks know they will be unable to sell these repossessed properties, they should consider allowing young people to remain in their homes and renegotiating proper terms with them.  Perhaps their customers could pay the interest only for a while or perhaps the term of the loans could be extended.  This would mean fewer repossessions and still would generate some revenue for the banks.  Taking people to court or sending them to prison because they owe money is not an appropriate option and one cannot draw blood from a stone.  For those whose homes are repossessed, few options exist.  Social housing has dried up as waiting lists for council housing are very lengthy and homelessness now is a real possibility for some of those affected.  This is all the more difficult to stomach because thousands of apartments and houses, which were built nationwide in the past ten years on foot of the economic boom, now lie empty.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I understand the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently announced an initiative to hand over 3,700 affordable housing units to local authorities to address the need for social housing and in theory I welcome this step.  However, it is vital that those who are most in need and who have been waiting longest will be housed as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The rent supplement scheme should also be overhauled to address housing needs.  Some 91,000 people receive rent supplement.  Last year the Government paid approximately €400 million on rent supplement to landlords across the country.  If tenants were housed under voluntary housing or local authority housing schemes it would save the State millions and the standard of accommodation would be better.  Many private properties in this scheme are in a terrible state and the taxpayer is funding them.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Meanwhile, NAMA proposes to bail out almost 2,000 of the biggest business people in the country and the Irish taxpayer will carry the risk.  I cannot understand how the Government defends such reckless behaviour.  The country desperately needs strong and visionary leadership but, if the past few days are anything to go by, this is a long way off.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">We badly need to get credit flowing to keep the country afloat.  It is beyond belief that a small business cannot borrow €10,000.  It is almost impossible to secure a loan from a bank.  How can we expect small and medium sized businesses to survive in this climate?  Each day I meet many people working in the local shops struggling to keep the doors open and to keep people employed locally.  Why do we not turn our attention to the post offices?  They are as stable as anything else in this country.  Perhaps we could examine some way of providing small loans to businesses to keep them afloat.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The Minister of State referred to Fine Gael's good bank approach.  I have read this policy and have listened carefully to the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton.  It is beyond belief that today we realise that NAMA is the only option in this country.  Fine Gael has an alternative and the Minister should take this on board.  NAMA is wrong for the country and for the many people who have suffered greatly, not through their fault but because of the reckless spending of this Government.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_396">While he is not in the Chamber at the moment, I wish to record my congratulations to Deputy Kirk on his elevation to the post of Ceann Comhairle.  I am sure he will do an excellent job.  I was sorry to see Deputy O'Donoghue step down from the post.  He did an excellent job and was seen as very fair by everyone.  I will not go into anything else around that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I welcome the opportunity to speak on NAMA, which I agree is the preferred method of resolving the banking crisis.  It is not a bailout of bankers, the mantra that has been trotted out time and time again.  Nor is it a bailout of developers, it is a bailout for the country.  We must put the country first and get on a sound financial footing.  We must be seen to be do something credible internationally.  Otherwise, we would not be able to borrow on the international market to sustain us.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">It is incorrect to say that bankers are being soft on developers or those who owe money.  Today I read newspaper reports on Anglo Irish Bank taking proceedings against some of the developers who owe money to the bank.  This is what NAMA will do when it takes over the loans.  Let nobody be under any illusions: developers will be chased for the money they owe and must pay the money or face being liquidated.  At one stage banks thought they would get a soft ride due to NAMA but they realise that this is not the case and that they must repay.  They will pay for any NAMA losses, as the Minister has made clear.  The banks did not want this but it is included in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">From speaking to business people in my constituency, I know there was much uncertainty last week about how long the Government would last because of the Green Party conference.  While the Green Party members agreed with NAMA by and large, they did not want to see the Government falling because they see that something must be done.  We are attempting to do this through NAMA and, if the Government fell, we would be back to stage one.  This would involve putting this recovery on hold for a number of months which would be to the detriment of the country.  We must be ready to get in on the upturn that is starting to happen elsewhere.  I saw reports about Singapore on television last night.  Growth in the third quarter was 15%, while it was 1% for the same period one year ago.  We do not know how long this will take but we must be ready when it comes.  I commend the Minister for Finance on the way he has addressed this issue.  He has made it clear that he is willing to make changes to legislation if they are warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Deputy McGinley referred to Deputy Lee and his comments on the building bubble.  Before he was a Deputy, when he was a reporter for RTE, he thought NAMA was a good idea when it was first suggested.  He was supportive of it at the outset.  Now he must sing a different tune because he is in the House and is a member of Fine Gael.  Since he left RTE, economic reporting on the station has become far more balanced.  Some on the Opposition benches are opposed to NAMA as a concept but they can have an important part to play by suggesting amendments to this legislation.  That will ensure it is as workable and comprehensible as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I refer to the comments of Alan Dukes and Garret FitzGerald.  There are critics of NAMA but there has been much support and we should not forget this.  IBEC referred to the Irish situation as tough but manageable and stated that "NAMA, more action on the public finances in the budget, a "Yes" vote in the Lisbon referendum [this statement was issued prior to the referendum] would all help to improve the country's image abroad".</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I was abroad in the past few days as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  Some 22 of the 27 EU countries attended the meeting.  They had been following Ireland's Lisbon treaty referendum very closely.  They were all very relieved at what we had done.  Their attitude would have been that if Ireland did not want to come along, they would have moved on without us.  We did the right thing on the Lisbon treaty and this is part of restoring our credibility internationally.  We must also do so in respect of NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">IBEC stated that it gave conditional welcome to the publication of revised legislation establishing NAMA.  The IBEC director general, Danny McCoy, stated, "It is in everyone's interests that we move quickly to repair our banking system and restore the flow of credit throughout the economy".  Speaking on RTE's "This Week", Alan Dukes described the Fine Gael proposal to set up a national recovery bank as "very cumbersome, very doubtful of success and much less clear" than the NAMA proposal.  Mr. Dukes said the establishment of NAMA was the Government's best option.  The former Fine Gael Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, made a stunning intervention in the NAMA debate, warning that a Dáil rejection of the Government's banking or budgetary proposals could throw our State into the hands of the International Monetary Fund.  That is something we do not want to see happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">It is in the interest of all of us that we get this right and I know that will be supported on all sides of the House.  We may have various proposals for tackling the matter but we are all in this together and we must get it right for the sake of our country.  NAMA management has already admitted it does not have the expertise to value the €77 billion of developer loans and how could it?  The suggestion is that a panel of auctioneers will be engaged to do so.  Indications are that discounts of 30%, which would mean a valuation of €54 billion, will be applied.  It is difficult to quantify whether this is the correct figure as there is little or no market at present.  The banks are not lending to accommodate such purchases, and if they were to whom would they lend in the current climate?  As most of the developers have assets which will be transferred to NAMA it will limit the scope to deal with traditional clients for the disposal of these assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Government, in going the NAMA route, is in a difficult situation.  If the assets have too low a discount, while it may in the short term help the banks' balance sheets, it will result in the asset value being too high to sell on and will only stagnate the entire economy.  If the impaired asset values are too highly discounted it will result in serious consequences for the banks' balance sheets and involve the Government in substantial capital injections to recapitalise the banks and eventual nationalisation of the banks thereby leaving the taxpayer further exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I am opposed to the nationalisation of the banks as I feel the cost of borrowing to this country would increase as a result.  We must engender confidence and consider international perceptions.  By nationalising the banks we would send out the wrong signals internationally.  It would also cost us much more as interest rates on what we are borrowing internationally would increase, which would be to the detriment of what we are trying to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">What is most important is to ensure that these toxic assets are sold on to outlets that will develop them and get the construction industry moving again.  If the assets are too highly valued they will stay dormant for years and no benefit will accrue to the Government, taxpayer or future employment prospects.  This second alternative is probably the best option as it would give the Government and the taxpayer the best end result and would remove some of the risks that NAMA holds.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">International asset management companies such as New York-based Blackrock and the Western Asset Management Group in San Francisco are long established in this field of activity and a public private arrangement with the Government would ensure that somebody with expertise would correctly value the assets.  This has happened elsewhere and international expertise exists to manage this.  With their track records they will be certain to make a profit, in which the Government and the taxpayer would participate, and they have international contacts to enable them to sell the assets to somebody who can develop them and create employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">It is most likely that in going the NAMA route some of these agencies will become involved to a lesser extent with no benefit to either the Government or the taxpayer.  It would allow these agencies to cherry-pick the best value for money assets and leave the vast majority of impaired assets much harder to dispose of, with very serious consequences for the Government and taxpayers.  This would result in a very prolonged recession and much slower economic recovery.  I am unsure what interest these groups would have in such a situation and perhaps there might not be any such interest but it is something that could be explored.  The Minister is open to exploring all of these possibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Another very important reason international asset management agencies should be involved in this process is that we must take into account that almost €34 billion of the €77 billion is related to assets in the UK, Europe and the US.  Surely their overseas expertise would be extremely important in valuing and disposing of these assets.  Much criticism has been made of the way we suggest that these assets will have a certain value.  The likelihood is that the fall in the book value of assets held internationally will probably be less than the fall in the book value of those in this country; overall we will probably hit the figure the Government suggests we will.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The very significant knock-on effect to the Government in engaging with international asset management agencies would leave the Government in a stronger position — once the toxic debt of €77 billion is removed — to concentrate on a solid plan to sort out the banks.  The banks would need more recapitalisation and the Government could consider the possibility of merging the two main banks.  We tend to consider the two main banks in this country, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, as large banks.  However, they are not.  Internationally, they are very small players and we should take this into account in the future.  I do not suggest that we should merge them but it will have to be considered at some stage.  While that is a debate for another day, it should be noted that such a step should encourage the vast amount of deposits which has left the country to be repatriated.  It would also encourage deposits from abroad, which is another side of the matter we should consider.  It would help to restore Ireland's credit rating and attract foreign investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The confidence of which I spoke earlier is the theme running through my contribution.  We must disseminate it internationally and this Bill is the best way of doing so.  We could then move on to leave the Government to the very urgent task of tackling job creation.  At present, the number unemployed stands at approximately 450,000.  Many thought it would rise substantially from this but thankfully the indications seem to be that it has begun to level off.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I have spoken to the Minister, and the Minister is more aware of the issue than I am, about introducing a mechanism or formula to ensure the banks lend to small businesses to allow them continue.  This is not happening at present.  I do not know how we can force it but it must be done.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have repeatedly told us over the past 12 months that we are in uncharted waters.  This is true, and anybody who was born in the 1940s or 1950s——</p>

          <p eId="para_416">We have only one chance to get this right.  It would be prudent to ensure we have the proper international expertise to help us sort this out.  This is undoubtedly the most important political decision in our lifetime.  This has been stated by more than one speaker and it is a fact.  The future of this country and generations to come totally depend on us making the right decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Whatever we end up with, we must all work with it and I include in that cross-party and all shades of political opinion.  There is no point in getting into a game of political point scoring.  We must send out a very strong message on Ireland Inc. internationally and we will not do so if we are arguing among ourselves.  Internationally, we need to be considered again as serious players to sort out the various problems we have.  While this very proactive decision may not suit the banks' balance sheets in the short term, nevertheless the future of the country and its people must take priority over any short-term fix.  The rewards then will be all the greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Apart from commercial assets included in the €77 billion, a substantial portion relates to residential and unfinished houses and apartments.  It is estimated up to 150,000 residential units remain unsold.  Considering there is such great value in the market, I asked friends working in the banking sector why fewer mortgages have been taken out.  They explained the banks have reverted to a previous practice in that a person looking for a 90% mortgage must put down a 10% deposit.  We should never have moved away from that practice but it happened.  Many people do not have the 10% deposit to put down because they got out of the habit of saving, despite the efforts of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, with the special savings investment account scheme, SSIA.  People must realise they must have a deposit before they can get a mortgage.  At least that will mean they will have manageable mortgages which did not happen in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">It is projected that overall income this year will be reduced by more than €15 billion compared to 2007.  This, coupled with social welfare expenditure expected to come close to €20 billion, makes for a serious situation.  It was recently reported on RTE that approximately 130,000 mortgages are in negative equity of which 50,000 holders are unemployed.  This is projected to rise to 250,000 and 100,000 respectively in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The two most important issues to be dealt with are banking and unemployment.  If banking is correctly dealt with, then employment will have every chance.  The Minister for Finance is trying to keep politics out of this as much as possible, as it more an issue of how best to tackle the problem.  I accept the bona fides of the Opposition parties.  While I may not agree with them, I believe they are putting forward what they genuinely believe to be the right solution.  Assuming this legislation does complete its Second Stage in the House, I would hope that everybody can work together in order to get as good a Bill in place as is possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">The former US president, Thomas Jefferson said of banks in 1802:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_424">I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">This is an apt description of our current banking situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">On the Pat Kenny radio show this morning, I heard of people who have woken up homeless and others in the courts defending themselves against the banks while trying to hold on to their homes.  Many were losing their homes to the very bankers and banks that we are now bailing out with taxpayers' money.  There is no danger these bankers will lose their banks or any property of great substance to themselves such as their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I know a young couple with two small children who own a house in a Dublin suburb.  Recently, the husband lost his job while his wife was a stay-at-home mother.  They had to hand back their home to the bank, walk away from it and return to her parents' house to live.  They have been told by the banks never to come looking for a loan again because they have been blacklisted.  This is what is happening to the ordinary people of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I know a person who had a small financial business which was closed down by the Financial Regulator ten years ago for a relatively small infringement.  That is the same regulator who sat back while Anglo Irish Bank built up its losses over a small number of years to the point that of the €77 billion NAMA lump sum, €28 billion relates to the bank.  Anglo Irish is now a zombie bank which lends to no one while its customers were a small number of wealthy property developers.  Yet, the nation must now bail it out while shamefully, this House voted to underwrite and guarantee it.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The leader of the Green Party, Deputy Gormley, who is present in the Chamber, steered a vote in favour of NAMA through his party last weekend.  How does he feel that loans of €28 billion were allowed to build up in this bank which the taxpayer must now underwrite?  Whatever about gambling, which is what it was for these property developers and speculators, NAMA is gambling with taxpayers' money and an unknown future.  We are being asked to take on board a hope value.  Fintan O'Toole wrote in an article during the early stages of the debate on the agency that it will lead to the NAMA-isation of our finances being built into the future economy.  We will, he pointed out, be dependent on the properties taken on having a value in ten years time which will equate with the amount of money the taxpayer is now putting into the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The people being asked to bail out the banks include the primary income earners in their families who lost their jobs and face an uncertain future with household bills to pay including large mortgages.  They include the owners of small indigenous companies that cannot gain access to credit from our banks to continue trading.  They are the taxpayers who are burdened with pension and income levies on top of the uncertainty of additional cuts and the possible introduction of water and property charges.  They are the people trying to manage on social welfare who never got caught up in the property bubble or benefited to any great extent from the Celtic tiger.  All are trying to live their lives when all sorts of obstacles and challenges confront them while the once-hailed builders, developers and bankers, portrayed as the elite among us and who profited immensely on the back of ordinary workers and taxpayers, see NAMA as the lifeboat coming to rescue them.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">My question as to where all the borrowed money has gone remains unanswered.  Many of the developers borrowed money to build large developments, units in which they charged between €400,000 and €600,000.  The moneys handed over by the ordinary people who bought these houses must be somewhere.  The young couple I referred to earlier were told by the bank they would have to find the money to pay back their loan.  Is there any real effort being made to go after the moneys the developers borrowed?</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Last week, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate in economics and a former chief economist in the World Bank, after a lecture at Trinity College Dublin told an interviewer:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_433">[NAMA] is the kind of highway robbery which we see happening all over the world, with guns pointing at the heads of the political leaders and the bankers claiming the sky will fall down and the economy will be devastated unless they get this money.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">He went on to say that the valuation system should take into account the compounded value, what would be compound interest if it were a loan for a house, and that we should seek much more for the long-term value of the properties included in NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">What disturbs me most is that there does not appear to be any attempt to change the culture of banking for the future.  I cannot see any instrument in the Bill that will make bankers change the way they do business with small companies that are trying to borrow money and are being refused, despite all the money the taxpayer is putting into the banks.  The banks should, for example, be forced to give favourable charges and interest rates to businesses over the next few years.  I refer to ordinary, small, indigenous industries.  There is also a service called factoring and invoice discounting for which banks charge.  A person who runs a small business made the practical proposal to me that the banks be forced to provide this service free of charge.  Specific measures should be taken to ensure the bankers give favourable terms to these small businesses in their time of difficulty.  I cannot understand why that cannot be done because it is taxpayers' money that the Government is putting into these banks.  Why can they not be given the money with basic conditions?  If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were giving a grant tomorrow to an organisation, his Department would be able to lay down the terms and conditions under which, and to say exactly how, it should spend the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Nothing seems to have been learnt from the failure of unbridled capitalism around the world and the failure of banks and developers to use money in any way that makes sense such that they have lost all this money at the taxpayers' expense.  There does not seem to be any mechanism by which, or any intention of doing anything, to change this culture which failed so miserably.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_437">I thank Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for sharing her time with me.  The issue we are debating today is probably one of the most important we will ever debate in this House because its implications are so enormous.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">NAMA is the Government's second colossal emergency measure to bail out the banks and financial institutions which caused the economic crisis.  The State's bank guarantee of nearly €500 billion in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 is now being underpinned by an asset management agency to try to prevent that ill-thought out guarantee from exposing the taxpayer to grave financial losses.  The reverse, however, is the case because this is a catch-22 for the taxpayer.  If the financial institutions go bust, the taxpayer picks up the tab from the original guarantee; if the asset portfolio is maintained at an artificially high level of value to bolster the stability and viability of the financial institutions, the taxpayer picks up the tab.  Heads or tails the banks win.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The entire banking system cannot be blanket guaranteed without the taxpayer picking up the tab for the moneys that have evaporated.  That seems to be what has happened.  Where has the money gone?  It can not have disappeared into thin air but in this case it appears to have done so. The asset valuation that is now being projected at a 30% markdown is already dumping significantly on the taxpayer.  The recent fiasco involving ACC Bank and Liam Carroll indicates that the real market value of property portfolios is the reverse of the Government's national valuation for NAMA.  Mr. Carroll's properties, that were the subject of the court hearings, have a market value of only 25% to 30% of their original monetary valuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">NAMA is the saviour of the property developers, speculators and the banking system precisely because this measure operates against the best interests of the taxpayers.  It is a high price to pay for mismanagement, negligence, greed and fraud by those "pillars of society" who lived high on the hog for the duration of the Celtic Tiger.  The stated purpose of the NAMA Bill is "to facilitate the availability of credit in the financial markets of the State."  There is absolutely no assurance that the banks will extend credit to hard-pressed businesses in Ireland.  The banks have been already financially guaranteed and refuse to part with this credit.  They have received €7 billion of taxpayers' money and the credit purse strings have not loosened one whit.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, extended a borrowing facility of €30 billion over a year ago to provide credit for small to medium enterprises.  While the Irish banks have drawn down a mere €300 million between them, it is not clear whether they have lent any of that money to small and medium-sized enterprises which are daily going to the wall because they cannot get a credit facility from the financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The banks are simply refusing to lend money to citizens and businesses.  They have no faith in the Irish economy and will not necessarily have any faith in it when NAMA is in place.  The irony is that they were responsible for causing the recession and now that it exists they will not lend money because they do not believe it is a good deal and feel that the small and medium-sized enterprises are too risky.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The Green Party, whose leader is in the House today, had a glorious opportunity last week when it was renegotiating the programme for government and seeking concessions on the content of NAMA.  It should have insisted that the Minister for Finance make it a statutory condition of the NAMA legislation that there would be a correlation between the banks' participation in NAMA and their provision of credit to the business sector, particularly small to medium sized businesses which are the life blood of the economy and account for 50% of all employment, and that this be done at a reasonable rate of interest.  It could and should have done that, but it did not.  NAMA is a ticking time bomb for the taxpayer which may eventually explode causing serious collateral damage.  There is a banking crisis and a modern economy cannot function without a functioning banking system.  We need a functioning retail banking system that will provide credit to citizens and businesses.  The Labour Party has proposed temporary nationalisation which would allow the banks to clean up their balance sheets without exposing the taxpayer to unnecessary risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The boardrooms of the banks remain essentially the same except for Anglo Irish Bank which has been nationalised.  For example, nine of the ten directors of AIB are unchanged apart from the two public interest directors.  The banks cannot be reformed without a clean out of the dysfunctional boardrooms which brought us to this sorry state.  The Green Party should have targeted this too in the negotiations which took place recently but I did not see this happen.  No country can allow its economy to be the plaything of private banks and financiers.  We must establish a state bank which will cater to the needs of the Irish economy and the Irish people and not to the dividends of the private shareholders.  This state bank will ensure the financial needs of small and medium-sized businesses are catered for and should also have a direct role in drawing down funds from the European Investment Bank, the European Reconstruction And Development Bank and the European Central Bank.  This would be one way to ensure the economy becomes the main thrust of a particular aspect of the banking system rather than the private reward of shareholders and bonuses for directors.  Finally, there is a need for a stimulus package.  The haemorrhaging of jobs must be stopped and the creation of new jobs must be stimulated.  The US and main EU economies have received substantial investment packages from their governments.  All the Government seems able to think of is to raise taxes, impose cuts and bail out the banks.  Such an approach can only deflate the economy, will reduce tax intake and increase unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">For the Government, NAMA is the only show in town, or TOSIT, as it is called.  It is its big idea and it is a dud.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Connick</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I am delighted to have the opportunity to make my contribution to what is, as many speakers have said, probably the most important legislation ever to pass through this House, certainly in the lifetime of this Dáil and probably in our lifetime in this Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, his staff and his advisers for all the work they put into the Bill.  The old phrase, "a lot done — more to do", is very apt in respect of this Bill.  We all know NAMA is, and will be, work in progress for many years ahead.  It is the best and only option for us to try to manage our way out of the very difficult financial situation in which we find ourselves and our banking system.  While not trivialising our own domestic problems, we must also deal with the worst global downturn and economic collapse since the Great Depression.  Last year, this Government had to readjust and manage the collapse of our tax receipts, the construction industry and the global downturn.  Our exports have held up extremely well but our competitiveness has been weakened — of that there is no doubt.  We lost thousands of jobs as a result of that.  We have also had to deal with a massive devaluation of sterling against the euro, which continues to be of significant concern to all of us.  This is also impacting seriously on our exports to what, traditionally, was our biggest market.  We also took €10 billion out of people's pockets in the adjustments in the budget which has had a real impact on people's lives.  This decision was not taken easily and resulted in real pain for people.  We understand that.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Opposition would have us believe it is all Fianna Fáil's fault, of course.  In its regular efforts to bay for blood from this Government it has been assisted by a hostile media.  Politics in this country has become soundbite central, with "blew the boom", "bailing out the banks" or "bailing out the developers" being the cries, or that boring old taunt, "the Galway tent", which is constantly trotted out.  The tent is gone, by the way, although it may be difficult for some people to accept this.  Funnily enough, it has been replaced by a Fine Gael tent at Punchestown.  People should be careful and watch out for that and where it might take them.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The Opposition's behaviour throughout this crisis has been appalling.  Its Deputies are so anxious to get their hands on power they are prepared to say anything and are backed up by a largely hostile media commentary.  We have a few friends in the media, for example, Gerry Ryan, Senator Eoghan Harris and Brendan O'Connor, who have occasionally shown the courage to go against the tide and I acknowledge that.  I have sat in this Chamber and been shocked at the recklessness of some of what has been said.  Have the Opposition leaders, Deputies Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore, stopped for a second to think of the message they are sending out?  Have they and their spokespersons on finance, Deputies Richard Bruton and Joan Burton, done so?  They all seem to have forgotten the banking system works on confidence.  They constantly refer to appearances by the banks before an Oireachtas committee over a year ago during which the banks said everything was okay.  One shudders to think what would have happened if they had said there was a problem.  That might have caused a run on the banks resulting in a bank collapse.  The consequences of that would be a calamity too great for me and many of us present to contemplate.  The so-called alternative government cannot agree on a solution for the banks in addressing the correction of the public finances.  Its parties have many policy differences in every sector yet want us to believe they could do a better job.  The parties with all the answers and none of the solutions will have to wait a bit longer, I am afraid.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Regarding blowing the boom, what about the record levels of expenditure invested across every programme for Government over recent years?  People seem to forget that.  Every village, town and county in this country has benefited.  People have seen the benefits of investment in schools, health services, roads, sports halls and across all sectors.  There was the small matter of the pension reserve fund, a mere €20 billion we managed to save through all that time against the backdrop of an Opposition calling for more expenditure.  In those times there was no mention of fiscal rectitude.  The Opposition was as visionary as all the economists who suddenly arrived on the scene in the past 12 months to say, "I told you so".  Where were they two years ago?  In fairness, I set apart Deputy George Lee who was eventually going to get it right, having predicted a downturn for almost ten years in a row.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">On bailing out the banks, the subject does not sit easy on the shoulders of any of my colleagues in Government.  If we had our way, we would not give them a penny.  However, without a functioning banking system we will not have an economy and the risks to the economy are now so great we must fix our banking system first.  NAMA is the best method of doing this.  It allows us to manage our way out of debt and allows our banks to get back to the business of ensuring funding is available to business.  It restores confidence in our banking system and gives us the opportunity to deal with the many unfinished sites and projects that will have value and, in time, will give a positive return to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I welcome the recent news that a levy will be applied to banks if a loss is made at the end of this scheme.  I would also like to see banks working closer with small businesses, showing the flexibility required to ensure that such businesses will survive these turbulent times.  Decisions must be made again at bank manager level rather than in the boardroom in Dublin or anywhere else that is removed from what is happening on the ground.  People in business are under serious pressure.  I recently met a publican, a good friend, who had a direct debit returned because he was €1.93 over his limit.  It cost him €18.50 to deal with that issue.  Surely this is not playing fair.  Discretion must be applied.  When my friend went to the bank he was told decisions were made in Dublin.  One can see the difficulties this causes.  Banks need to be told to behave in a way that is helpful in getting us out of the current mess.  Hiding behind best banking practice in this situation will not work.  The banks had a significant role in getting us into this mess and must now play their part in helping us to get out of it.  There are no free lunches.  As we take measures to save the banking system, the banks must take measures to save us and our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I turn to a matter of considerable concern to which Deputies on all sides of the House have referred, namely, mortgages and the difficulty people are finding in coping.  My colleague in the Seanad, Senator Marc MacSharry, recently produced a document of merit which warrants further consideration.  He and other contributors offered a number of solutions, including interest-only payments.  Obviously, that is not a permanent solution but it might consolidate people's affairs and give them the opportunity to get themselves out of the situation in which they find themselves.  Perhaps time limits might be set with the interest period being without penalty.  This would have implications for some aspects of the mortgage but is worth considering and I ask banks to look at such options.  Permanent extensions of a mortgage period or extending a 25 or 30-year mortgage are such options and might be examined.  There is the possibility of renting back a property from the lender.  In this situation the default on the mortgage is taken back by the bank which re-rents the property to the original mortgagee.  A moratorium, or breathing space, could be looked at because fixed rates are causing great difficulty for people who bought at a time when they thought it prudent to fix rates but now, with the lowering of interest rates, they are paying hundreds of euro more than they should.  Surely addressing that debt problem by means of a lower current rate is better than getting no payment at all or having a default at a much higher rate.  I call on the banks to look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Regarding the redrafting of the terms of a mortgage, there are some new mortgage holders who probably should never have been approved, many of whom went to mortgage brokers.  I deal with people in my constituency office every day who face enormous mortgage repayments and, unfortunately, are now on social welfare.  In many cases, there is no way out for some of these people because the scale of the mortgage is such it should not have been given.  We need to address this issue and I call on the banks to consider it again and see if they can do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Most builders I know have gone bust.  Those who are trying to struggle on are doing their best to keep a man or two in work.  For some builders everything has gone and they may lose their homes.  Previous speakers asked where the money has gone.  It went into further sites and developments and was eaten up.  However, it is time to stop demonising them.  The majority of the jobs lost, more than 100,000, have been in the construction sector.  It is possible that up to €10 billion of our current Exchequer shortfall comes from that sector alone.  If we are to get out of this situation, there is no doubt but that we will need a fully functional construction sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">We must stop the myth that borrowers and developers will walk away scot free because it is not true.  At local level, the builders who present at our constituency offices are in serious difficulties and their banks are pursuing them rigorously.  When NAMA takes over, the loans transferred to it will not be written down and borrowers will continue to owe the entire amount borrowed from the bank.  Many well established construction firms need a break.  They have viable projects in the pipeline and NAMA must work with them to try to maximise returns.  If NAMA is a success, which I believe it will be, what will be the Opposition's stance?  The winners at that stage will be the taxpayers, which is proper order.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">It is only fair to say that everyone is angry and frustrated with what has occurred during the past 18 months.  Hindsight is a wonderful tool, but no one could have foreseen the collapse of the global financial system.  We did the right thing with the bank guarantee on 30 September 2008 and we are doing the right thing now with NAMA's establishment.  I understand the concern, hurt and difficulty being experienced by people and many are in what I refer to as "walk away trouble" and may never recover.  Many people have seen their hopes and dreams dashed, but we must find a way out.  NAMA is an important component in getting the economy functioning again.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Our decisions last year, which saw €10 billion taken out of public expenditure, have hit people hard and we have further tough decisions to make in the coming months, but they must be made in the country's interests.  We must restore our competitiveness.  While there are signs that we are addressing this matter through falling prices, we have some way to go and the nation must buy into what we are trying to do.  For this to happen, we need everyone on board, including a hostile media.  Social partnership must be re-established with a new realism and a determination to refocus our efforts on putting Ireland Inc. back in business and preparing it for the global upturn when it comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Lisbon treaty has been passed and a new and refocused programme for Government has been agreed.  I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and his party on their work at the weekend.  Let us ensure that any of NAMA's current shortcomings are addressed by amendments proposed during the coming weeks.  Its swift passage through the House is critical because businesses cannot hold out much longer.  Then, we must focus our attention on the upcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Recently, I have received many e-mails, telephone calls and clinic visits from people from every background who are concerned about NAMA and its consequences for their futures and the futures of their children.  The public want to see people who have contributed to the difficulties in our banking system brought to justice.  They want to see them led away in handcuffs and jailed.  It is only proper that justice be served on those who behaved reprehensibly.  The public's confidence also needs to be restored.  They must have faith in the senior managers and directors of our financial institutions, and they need to know that their deposits are safe.  This will take time and effort on everyone's behalf.  The Government is committed to a complete reformation of the banking system, which I am confident it will achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Social benefits from NAMA are possible.  With so many people on housing lists, there will be an opportunity to purchase or take long-term leases on unsold apartment blocks or housing units for social and affordable housing.  This initiative should be pursued with vigour in the months and years ahead.  Other uses could include the acquisition of land for schools, public parks and social housing.  This is something that I would like to see occur and I encourage the Minister to ensure that these options are fully explored and delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Regarding the banks, it is vital that a commitment by the two main banks be secured and put into practice to boost lending by increasing lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises and to help first-time buyers.  We must adopt a new approach that sets new standards in banking regulation and corporate governance and creates a new and enhanced role for the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Much has been written about NAMA and many concerns have been raised, particularly regarding risk-sharing.  I share these concerns and hope that the new levy under discussion will be supported and included in the amendments to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">In Wexford last night, we met landowners along the Enniscorthy and Newross bypasses who were concerned about the new windfall tax of 80%.  The Minister for Finance has assured us that the tax will not apply to lands acquired via CPOs, but I call on him to make a public statement in that regard.  People have enough concerns without believing that such taxes will be imposed upon them at this time, so clearing this matter up would be helpful.  Concern about the sale of sites by farmers was also expressed.  There was a call for the roll-over tax of 25% of capital gains tax to be abolished.  As in most CPO cases, the land is replaced by the farmer.  I call on the Minister to reconsider this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The State will provide bonds to the value of €54 billion to the banks.  In return, the State will acquire assets which, if managed properly, will and should return a profit to the taxpayer.  While I accept that there is a risk, the risk posed by doing nothing is not an option and could have far greater consequences for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Losses will be incurred by the banks and their shareholders and NAMA will move against any borrower who will not or cannot repay his or her loans.  Further reductions in risks to the taxpayer will come in the form of prudent and realistic assumptions about future property prices and equity stakes in the banks, which I welcome.  NAMA is expected to pay its way through interest received from the performing loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I do not underestimate the task lying ahead, but we are following a plan of action that should help us to stabilise the situation and get our public finances back in order.  We have delivered on the Lisbon treaty and our new programme for Government has been agreed.  NAMA is on the way and we will succeed in fixing the banking system.  Next up is budget 2010 and we must continue our efforts to restore confidence in the economy, which will lead to job creation, restore our competitiveness and get this great country back on its feet.  With the help of the people and all sides of the House, I am confident that we will achieve our goals and make a success of this important legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_468">I am pleased to be able to contribute to this important debate.  I have read as much about the matter as I can, including debates in the House and the media, and the more I read, the more confused I get.  How did we find ourselves in this mess?  I considered countries like Canada, which has what is known as a boring and conservative regulatory system.  Canada has come through the infamous global financial crisis.  Many commentators on the Government side are wheeling in the crisis as an excuse for this mess.  Perhaps they are right to do so, but how was Ireland so exposed?</p>
          <p eId="para_469">On 20 February 2001, the then Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance announced the establishment of a new structure for financial sector regulation.  I remember that there was a considerable run-in to the debate and that there were many related issues because the Financial Regulator was to be set up as a separate body from the Central Bank.  Indeed, the Central Bank was to be stripped of some of its powers.  I will quote a press release:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_470">The structure will include a new authority responsible for prudential regulation of both the banking and insurance sectors and for consumer protection.  The new authority will be known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA).  It will have its own Board, with an independent Chairperson.  The Ministers intend to proceed immediately to establish an Interim Board for this new authority on a non-statutory basis which will appoint a Chief Executive and a Director of Customer Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Let us fast forward to 20 January 2009 and a press release issued by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  Its chairman, my constituency colleague, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_472">The crisis in the Irish banking industry, which necessitated a €400 billion guarantee from the Government followed by a recapitalisation scheme and the eventual nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, has led to many commentators calling into question the role of the regulator and the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">Deputy Michael Ahern further stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_474">The principles-based or light touch approach to regulation employed by the supervisory authorities here had been widely criticised, with the regulator and the Central Bank panned for not stress-testing the sector hard enough and down-playing the risk of rising bad debts on substantial property loans.  There is a growing consensus that both the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank should have been more proactive in curbing excessive and reckless lending, particularly in the property market.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">This is a given.  I note a major change was made in 2001 and at that time there were many misgivings about that change.  One needs to read between the lines as to the reason for that change and to find out who benefited from that change and why a light touch regulation was introduced to enable this massive amount of credit to be available on the markets.  Who benefited, why was it done and who did it?  I refer to what was done in countries such as Canada which does not have the same problems.  In Canada they kept to the old, boring conservative regulation and they do not have the problems we have, and Canadian banks are coming here to see if they can take over some of our banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I refer to the contribution by the Minister for Finance on this Bill. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_477">Large levels of speculative property lending left the banks exposed to a property market which had passed the peak of its cycle. The property market shuddered to a halt.  Sales of houses and other property stopped and repayments of interest and capital could not be met by borrowers.  International providers of funding and capital recognised the risks, cut credit lines and in some cases stopped dealing with the financial institutions.  In this weakened state, our banks started to hoard capital to protect themselves.  Stress on their capital and funding positions understandably damaged the ability of banks to provide a vital flow of new and existing lending to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">He went on to say that the banking system had let us down.  I maintain that the changes made and the light touch regulation has caused this major problem for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I refer to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 21 January 2009, at which Mr. Jim Farrell, chairman of the Financial Regulator stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_480">Under our principles-led supervision system, responsibility for the proper management and control of a financial services provider and the integrity of its systems rests with the board of directors and senior management.  [My reading of his statement is he was saying it was the responsibility of the banks to regulate themselves.] Prudent risk management, ethical behaviour and transparency in business dealings are key values expected of boards and senior management in regulated firms.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">It could be said that the banks were to blame.  Mr. Farrell further stated, "It is clear that a more intensive form of regulation is now required."  We know now this is the case but the horse has gone and now we are shutting the stable door, having opened it in 2001.  Mr. Farrell continued, "We are also reviewing the governance structures of the institutions to ensure that there are proper systems of internal control."</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The report by the High Court inspectors into the affairs of National Irish Bank published in 2004 concluded that, "The problem of DIRT evasion was an industry-wide phenomenon".  The inspectors wished to record that in the first year of their investigations they believed they did not have the full co-operation of the bank.  They said it appeared that ethical conduct was not a core value of the bank for a period of ten years and this value was sacrificed in favour of business growth and development, even if it meant defrauding the State or, in certain cases, imposing improper fees and charges on the bank's customers.  The lesson for all businesses and for all aspects of Irish society is that our standards of conduct must be regularly reviewed and improved to match those expected of a developed society.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Where was the Department and the Minister in all this?  The Government of the day changed the rules, brought in light touch regulation and let the banks do what they wished.  No changes were made up to 2004.  The High Court inspectors to inquire into NIB were appointed on 30 March 1998 and 15 June 1998.  As far back as 1998 we knew there was a problem with the banking culture.  Yet in 2001 the Government of the day changed to light touch regulation and took its eye off the ball until the Minister for Finance, the Financial Regulator and we all realise it was a big mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I contend the mistake was made by the Minister of the day for much of that time, who is now the Taoiseach.  He was the man in charge.  The buck stops with him.  The Taoiseach is to blame for a lot of the mess in which we find ourselves today and there is no avoiding that.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I refer to a point made by Deputy Connick in his contribution.  He stated, "Most builders I know have gone bust."  Many Deputies said, "We will chase the builders, we will chase the developers, we will go after them for every cent they have."  However, most of them are gone wallop and, if not, they have had time to move their assets out of the country so they cannot be touched.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Deputy Billy Kelleher said that people who owe money to the banks will continue to owe them money, the same amount to NAMA, and will have to pay it back or be pursued by default in the normal way.  Deputy Frank Fahey said that developers will continue to owe money.  Many Deputies have stated this in their contributions but as the developers have gone bust, how will they repay the money?</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The Minister opposite, Deputy John Gormley, was a teacher, as was I, and he will know it is recommended to make explanations simple. The financial services industry, and the pensions industry in particular, are brilliant at inventing a language of their own which the ordinary person is unable to understand.  It uses flowery English that nobody can understand and which serves to obscure all kinds of points.  As I understand, the banks borrowed money from bond holders or other international banks and, as the Minister admitted, they overdid it.  They gave this money to developers who bought land and property and built apartments.  That market has now collapsed.  The banks are left with the debts, the international people are screaming for this money and if the banks do not repay it they will go under and we will lose our banking system.  The Government then steps in and says, "Hang on, we will give you an IOU.  We will call it government bonds but it is an IOU."  The Government gives the banks an IOU which the banks exchange for cash from the ECB.  The banks can then repay the bond holders with this cash and in one bound the banks are free and are out the gap even though levies have been imposed on them.  The banks can now breathe a sigh of relief and go back to their boardrooms and relax.  The ECB is holding the IOUs and the Government, the taxpayer, has to pick up the tab and repay those IOUs at some stage.  Much of the development land that NAMA or the taxpayer owns is virtually worthless and there is currently no market for it.  In my own area there are fields which were bought for millions of euro and, as one man said to me, "Sheep could not even eat the grass because it is full of weeds."  The land will never realise the value of the money paid for it.  How will NAMA get back that money?</p>
          <p eId="para_488">It is hoped that in the future the value of this property will rise but this is only a hope as there is no proof it will happen.  One commentator, Mr. David McWilliams said, "The idea of property prices rising while inflation is falling is something even Brian Lenihan, our Minister for Finance...would find hard to sell."  This long-term economic value is very strange.  Many commentators have spoken on NAMA.  NAMA will be a very substantial State monopoly.  Some people have stated that it will be the largest owner of property in the world, which is phenomenal.  When one considers the numbers and the billions of euro involved, it is absolutely scary and the taxpayer is taking on this burden.  Thus, it is only right that we should have a substantial debate and put forward alternatives.  I am perturbed that the alternatives put forward are dismissed politically instead of being examined to establish if there are good ideas among them.  Some international experts maintain the NAMA idea is not a good one and that it should be considered very carefully indeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Today, I encountered an interesting article by Professor Morgan Kelly in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He adds some comments to the debate and perhaps someone will respond to these later.  We are all focused on NAMA, the debt, the properties and so forth.  However, there is another elephant in the drawing room too, that is, the very substantial personal debt accrued by people and businesses throughout the State.  I understand NAMA will start with loans of €5 million and work up.  What happens to the loans below that figure still in the banks?  Will they be left with the banks?  Will the banks use the cash they get through the sale of the bonds to clear some of that debt?  How big is it?  Will the Minister inform us when he is winding up of the extent of the personal debt that the banks are holding that will not be paid back?</p>
          <p eId="para_490">In his article, Professor Kelly refers to "the destruction of the Irish commercial class, who we might have hoped to be an engine of export led recovery as they were in the 1990s", and that this is "likely to prove one of the most enduring and costly legacies of the property bubble".  There is another issue here.  Several Deputies have referred to the fact that businesses are finding it hard to get cash from banks.  We have all been critical of easy credit and I began my contribution this evening by referring to the availability of easy credit.  My understanding is that the banks are lending and will lend to viable businesses.  However, in our current economic climate, very few businesses are viable.  Businesses are struggling and what is missing from a Government policy point of view is some form of a stimulus package to get businesses moving again and to get money flowing in the economy.  Such a package does not seem to exist.  The banks will get cash and sail off back to their boardrooms happy, and the developers are already out of the gap.  Thus the banks and developers have been looked after.  However, the taxpayer is left holding the baby to the tune of unknown tens of billions of euro into the future.  Businesses cannot operate because the economy is going down all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">What proposals does the Government have to get the economy moving?  It is not simply a matter of throwing good money after bad.  Professor Kelly stated that "forcing banks to lend to SMEs will only compound our problems".  This is in the case of SMEs that are not viable.  He continued: "One condition of the Japanese bank recapitalisation in 1999 was that they lend to small firms, but the effect was to heap a second layer of non-performing loans onto existing property losses."  There is an issue here which is a catch-22 situation.  The way out of this is for the Government to start stimulating the economy such that we get a real economy working again, not simply a false economy or throwing money at the problem.  We must do more than this and we must have imagination.  He continued: "Even after the crushing expense of NAMA, Irish banks will still be seriously short of capital", a point I made earlier.  Professor Kelly further stated: "Under the current, deliberately lax, international bank regulations, AIB and Bank of Ireland need capital of around €8.5 billion."  The Green Party will aid Fianna Fáil in passing the legislation, but once NAMA is passed a very significant problem will remain.  A very substantial recapitalisation remains to be carried out.  It is unquantifiable but we will need a further €8.5 billion.  I am concerned that the banks are being let off scot free and no pressure is being put on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Deputy Bruton proposed making money available upfront now through a good bank which would be totally ring-fenced, a State recovery bank with no toxic debts whatsoever.  This would allow money to be available now for viable businesses.  According to Professor Morgan Kelly it will be very difficult for such a proposal to work later.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Many speakers referred to the issue of what happens to the ordinary person who owes money to the banks.  Yesterday, I received a call from a person whose husband was jailed because he owed some money.  This is taking place along with house repossession and so forth.  Some form of stimulus package from the Government to get the economy up and running is missing.  There seems to be no idea or proposal forthcoming and nothing is happening.  There is a good deal of lofty aspiration for the future, but nothing right now when it is most needed.  This emergency has been before us for almost 18 months.  It is a long time to wait for something to happen.  An increasing number of people are unemployed and more people are appearing before the High Court and other courts threatened with house repossession.  We are told we can expect a good deal more of this between now and the end of this year and into early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">It is important to discuss these issues and this is the most important debate we have held here.  I want Committee Stage of the Bill completed in the Chamber, not hidden somewhere in the bunker.  Mr. Colm McCarthy stated this country has gone bust, which scares the living daylights out of me.  We must see real leadership and I am very concerned about NAMA, especially when so many international experts have expressed such concern.  This is beyond politics.  I call on all Deputies to really examine what is being said and written about this issue.  Let us forget about the medical card, planning permission, the pot hole down the road and the vote in two years time; this is far more important than any of those matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">Tá díospóireacht thar a bheith tábhachtach ar siúl anseo.  Nuair a foilsíodh an dréacht den reachtaíocht seo ar 30 Iúil i mbliana, cuireadh tús leis an díospóireacht.  B'shin an cuspóir a bhí ag an Aire Airgeadais ag an am.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh díospóireacht chuimsitheach againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">In the time during which the debate has been held we have all been reminded that we are not here for the first time.  Many of the problems under discussion have been aired previously, especially when my party was in Opposition.  I refer to the way in which the property bubble was overheated and the unsustainable nature of that practice.  Unfortunately, this has all been borne out in subsequent events.  However, going back will not help us other than to allow us to appreciate that this has not taken place recently but has been brewing for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">There is no one Minister for Finance or Government that represents the beginning and the end of this matter.  However, I hope that everyone, having considered the matter, can appreciate that one of the mistakes we made was to treat money as a commodity.  It was considered more important than food, caring or any of the other important responsibilities in society; it was an end in itself.  However, such a commodity is not like cars or computers or the tangible parts of an economy which we all need.  In fact, it is no more or less than a mechanism of barter.  That may be difficult for people who deal with money all the time to appreciate because they are so sucked up in the accumulative nature of money, which is based around the economic growth model that has taken root.  However, it is important to bear in mind that it is a mechanism of barter which allows people to specialise, and for all that it is very necessary and useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">It means that not everyone has to be a mechanic because we can pay someone to repair the car.  Not everyone has to be a farmer, but we can pay a fair price to people to grow our food.  Not everyone has to be a builder either because others can build the houses we need.  There are people who like to be a jack-of-all-trades and good luck to them, but they are rare and very special people.  Ultimately, money allows us to have specialists so that society can develop and the quality of life improves as a result.  However, we now have an urgent problem that cannot be debated for much longer.  We need to act and that action requires some type of asset management agency.  It is a painful readjustment strategy and must succeed because I do not want to contemplate failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">It has to succeed in rebuilding trust and recapitalising our money system.  Essentially, that trust is where I feel we need to do more work in the Green Party.  We need to ensure that the social dividend aspect of the legislation delivers on the deal.  The public is being asked to share the pain, so it must ensure that it gets the gain also.  That is part of the equation.  If it is to be trustworthy, it must deliver sufficient regulation.  We have had a failure of regulation, which is clear in hindsight.  Countries like Canada, which are not currently in the same difficulties — although they have a recession and there is much unemployment — were very strict when banks wanted to merge and would not allow that to happen.  They could not overlook that situation.  Likewise, the windfall tax is an aspect of community gain if a community has to take pain.  There has been disquiet among IFA members, for example, on that situation, but people must distinguish between somebody who needs to build a house for a son or daughter, which is not a developer-style or re-zoning situation, and somebody in the large-scale developer league, with which we are all too familiar.  I hope discussions can take place which will clarify and satisfy those concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I have received a number of e-mails and would like to read part of one into the record.  It is from a senior member of staff in a money-brokering division of a large stockbroker firm.  To my mind, the correspondent has elucidated what people need to hear.  I do not wish to name this person but the House will understand when I read part of the e-mail.  As regards NAMA, he thinks it is a clever piece of legislation and the safeguards included are more than sufficient to safeguard the taxpayer.  From his e-mail address, one can see that he works in a well respected stockbroking firm.  One might say, "He would say that, wouldn't he?", and he is obviously inviting people to be suspicious, but if Members listen further I think they will agree that he has something worthwhile to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The area he works in is highly specialised.  He is in a managing director's role in a money-brokering division and is probably best placed to see the effects the funding crisis has had on the banks.  He states that the crisis has been brewing since May 2007 and he adds that it is fair to say that our institutions are close to pariah status in international money markets.  He firmly believes that the NAMA proposal will solve this, as it will improve the loan-to-deposit ratio so significantly that it will see a flow of new funding into the country by next spring.  He states that we will have the first set of clean balance sheets in Europe and a significant first mover advantage.  He asks provocatively if it is a bailout for the banks and he answers: "Absolutely."  He also asks if the banks deserve to be nationalised for their behaviour and the answer again is "Absolutely".  He then asks if there is an alternative to the NAMA plan, but he does not believe there is a radical one.  There may be variations on a theme, but no major alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">In his opinion, based on 20 years as a money broker, the implications for sovereign and bank funding if AIB and Bank of Ireland were to be nationalised would be nothing short of catastrophic.  The flow of funds out of the country would be so significant that, he states, we would have the ECB and IMF here within weeks of it happening.  People may ask why but, he states, the answer is evident from the flow of funds out of Anglo Irish Bank since it was nationalised, which he estimates to be in excess of €15 billion.  Why does this happen?  Simply put, an investor with €100 million to lend to Ireland this time last year lent €20 million to AIB, €20 million to Bank of Ireland, €20 million to Irish Life &amp; Permanent and €20 million to Anglo Irish Bank and bought €20 million of Irish Government bonds.  Once the crisis started, the overall limit of €100 million was probably reduced by anything from 20% to 100%.  Let us assume the investor reduced his overall limit by 20% to €80 million and his individual limits to €16 million each.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">When Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised, it effectively became part of the Government of Ireland and its limit was incorporated into the Irish limit of €16 million, reducing the pool to Ireland by €64 million.  Nationalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland would have the effect of immediately reducing it by a further 32% at least as, he believes, that international investors would take flight.  No amount of ECB money would replace this quality of funding and, in his view, it would lead us into a lengthy depression in Ireland.  He says there is ample evidence that, on the back of the promise of NAMA, sovereign funding is improving.  Based on his experience, he states that he would be 100% happy that, with the post-NAMA publication of clean balance sheets, funding will flow here and that the real economy will see the benefits.  The banks will have to lend; otherwise, they will end up with a loan-to-deposit ratio of less than 100%.  This will revive the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">This is not only about reviving our economy, but also about reviving our communities.  As we have heard, the land bank will be large and there is a need for local authorities to come forward with ideas.  That land should be used in the interim for the type of things I would like to see.  I have spoken to farmers who regard allotments as a pension plan and there is potential in that area for food production.  We need to train people in food skills.  The Kenny report will be implemented when local authorities begin to take initiatives on how their communities are to be planned, rather than waiting for developers to do it.  Likewise, credit unions have legislation that urges them to invest in their communities, not just in banks.  While we need to capitalise the banks, we also need to invest in our communities.  I hope that credit unions will be part of that, as well as local authorities.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_518">The purpose of this legislation is to amend and extend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, to provide for mandatory professional insurance for certain medical practitioners and to provide for connected matters.  The legislation is intended to protect patients and to help doctors.  It is designed to regulate doctors in order that they have appropriate insurance to practise medicine in Ireland.  Currently, one can be registered with the Medical Council.  One is not expected to have insurance and while it is ethically expected that one would have insurance, it is not a legal requirement nor is it a criminal offence to practise without it.  The Bill seeks to address both deficits and to address ever increasing globalisation whereby doctors can visit private clinics, perform surgery and leave again.  I do not denigrate such clinics.  Their regulation is an issue but the purpose of the Bill is to provide an absolute guarantee to the public that doctors practising in Ireland have adequate and appropriate insurance and indemnity.  They are slightly different but it is not the purpose of the Bill, lest it be construed so, that one or the other would no longer be acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The majority of doctors are responsible and they carry appropriate medical negligence insurance.  However, as in all professions, some may not have an appropriate level of insurance cover either through inadvertence or design.  The Department of Health and Children and the Medical Council do not know how many practitioners have insurance, what level of cover they hold, the type of insurance they hold or who provides it.  Fine Gael believes that, at the very least, this information must be collected and, following the enactment of this Bill, all doctors will be required to have adequate insurance cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The legislation will make medical indemnity cover, forms of which can range from a formal contract of insurance to the type of discretionary indemnity provided by mutual societies such as the Medical Defence Union, MPU and Medical Protection Society, MPS, compulsory.  The Bill aims to close a loophole that could allow an unscrupulous doctor to apply for medical registration and practise without insurance.   We intend that insurance will be compulsory for all practising doctors and the Bill provides that the Medical Council will have the power to set the appropriate type and level of insurance to be held by different classes of practitioners.  For example, eastern European countries with poor economies would consider a €200,000 insurance bond more than adequate to meet their needs whereas clearly in Ireland that would not be adequate.  Currently, the Medical Council has no such power and while it states doctors must have adequate cover, there is no system of checking to make sure doctors have cover or adequate cover.  Categories of practitioner, such as full-time academics, practitioners registered in Ireland but practising abroad or those retired, would be exempt from holding such indemnity or insurance cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">This Bill is proposed in the interest of both patients and doctors.  It guarantees, for the first time, that patients are protected in so far as that in the event of a mistake or medical negligence, they can claim financial compensation from a doctor.  Improved regulation provides better protection to patients, removing the possibility whereby a doctor may not have appropriate insurance or any insurance cover at all.  The legislation maintains trust in the profession as a whole, while ensuring all doctors have sufficient insurance cover.  It will further provide that before the Medical Council can issue a certificate to practise to a practitioner, written evidence of appropriate insurance must be produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Someone irresponsible could practise in Ireland without the appropriate medical negligence insurance and, in the case of negligent or unsatisfactory treatment, an aggrieved or injured patient may have no redress to compensation.  The Bill is intended to apply to doctors who are not domiciled in Ireland but who often practise here in private clinics, as well as practitioners normally resident in Ireland.  In the event of mistakes or medical negligence, we must offer patients the best protection we can.  Compulsory indemnity would instil confidence in the system and guarantee patients' redress if something went wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">A draft directive on patient rights in cross-border health care is being considered by the institutions of the European Union.  Article 5(1)(<i>e</i>) of the draft directive, as proposed by the Commission, requires member states providing treatment to ensure that health care providers have systems of professional liability insurance or a guarantee or similar equivalent arrangements in place.  The UK Government has sought to introduce mandatory indemnity for doctors.  The legislation was approved by the UK Parliament in 2006.  In parallel with bringing forward the legislation, the UK Government sought to make indemnity compulsory for other health care professionals such as nurses and midwives and mandatory indemnity is being reviewed with a view to its introduction for all professionals.  Our Bill is not aimed at nurses or other medical professionals.  Other countries such as Singapore and South Africa have taken steps to introduce mandatory indemnity for doctors and they have legislation in draft form.  Legislation was also approved in the Cayman Islands to require doctors to have indemnity.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Irish doctors have four main options: the clinical indemnity scheme, the Medical Defence Union, the Medical Protection Society and Medisec.  Historically there were other insurers but most have withdrawn.  It has been troublesome to get some of them to honour their commitments.  I had a discussion with an insurer earlier and there have been issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">There are three types of insurance.  Occurrence-based insurance is offered by the MPS and the MDU.  If one was insured when the event occurred, one remains insured even if the claim is not processed for years afterwards.  Claims-based insurance is offered by Medisec.  If the claim is made years after the event and the professional is no longer insured, cover may not be in place.  Run-off cover is required and that will be addressed in the legislation.  The clinical indemnity scheme provides State insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">One of the most notable features of clinical negligence litigation is the long time lag between an alleged negligent act and an ensuing claim.  Professional indemnity has traditionally been provided on an occurrence-based basis because claims may be brought many years after the event.  In other words, the indemnity arrangements doctors have in place at the time of an incident can be invoked at any time in the future when a claim emerges.  This may be long after they have changed indemnifiers, retired, or even after death.  The alternative form of indemnity is claims-made insurance cover.  Most insurance policies are offered on this basis and a policy must be in force when a claim is reported.  This is all very well for some types of cover, where an incident is reported to the indemnifier almost immediately, for example, car insurance claims, but it does not suffice for medical insurance where claims could be made years later when problems are identified and claimants reach the point where there can be a court case.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Given the nature of claims-made indemnity, it is more difficult to move from one insurer to another or to take breaks from practice without the risk of gaps developing in cover.  A clinical negligence claim will often be made two or three years after the original adverse incident.  The claim may be made decades after the event in some cases.  However, with occurrence-based indemnity, the date on which a claim is brought or reported has no bearing on the right to seek assistance.  The MPS and the MDU offer such insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">There is no obligation to obtain run-off cover when doctors terminate their insurance policy.  However, such cover should be mandatory when doctors do so to avoid gaps in cover.  Normally when they move insurer, the new insurer will arrange run-off cover.  When doctors leave their insurer because of retirement, career break or otherwise, the insurer could be required to offer run-off cover for a specific period and for a reasonable premium.  Such cover protects patients and doctors against claims that may emerge after the policy has terminated but that arise from events unreported during their period of cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">There is a lack of regulation in private clinics.  In the public service all HSE staff, including consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, nurses and other clinical staff employed by health agencies, are covered by the State clinical indemnity scheme.  Conversely, in the private sector we do not know if a medical professional has indemnity insurance unless a claim is made.  If one holds a contract with the GMS, one must produce one's insurance, but an issue arises in terms of locums and other private doctors who come and go and whom we presume have insurance but who may not on some occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">During the past decade the cosmetic surgery business expanded exponentially.  The absence of proper regulation in this area has meant that, on occasions, under-qualified and untrained practitioners have been allowed to perform complicated cosmetic surgery procedures such as breast augmentation, liposuction and gastric banding which have put patients' lives at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">A number of issues arise in that regard from the Medical Council's perspective.  A doctor may be legitimately on the medical register in this country but not on the specialist register concerned.  They may be operating in a specialist area such as plastic or cosmetic surgery even though they are not listed as being such a doctor on the medical register.  That puts the Medical Council in a position where it is the body to insist on the type of cover people should have and make that sort of activity illegal.  It is clear some resource issues may arise for the Medical Council, but it is in the public interest and the best interest of patients that this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I am aware of at least two cases where a doctor came to this country, operated on a patient, the procedure was not a success and after several return visits to the clinic, the person decided to take legal action.  They eventually got to court three years later.  The doctor came over from England, admitted he made a mess of the operation but said that he was now bankrupt and no longer had insurance.  The patient had no redress in that case and we must address those situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The other one is a specific case which was made public but I apologise to the family for any upset it might cause them to have it mentioned again.  Absence of regulation had fatal consequences for Bernadette Reid, from Wicklow, who died following surgery for a gastric band operation in a south Dublin clinic, Advanced Cosmetic Surgery.  It is reported that Ms Reid went for surgery against the advice of her general practitioner, who considered her unsuitable for the procedure because she had chronic asthma.  At no time had anyone from the clinic consulted with the lady's GP or requested her medical records prior to beginning the procedure.  During the course of the procedure, it apparently became obvious that she had a tumour and the operation was abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Regulation of the clinics here is another issue that arises, but it is not one we will deal with today.  It is important that patients here are protected and that it is a legal requirement for anyone registered to be insured.  The Bill provides for punitive penalties in terms of fines and custodial sentences, particularly for a recurrence.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I want to record that I received a telephone call from the Minister this morning, whom I know is not opposed to the Bill in principle.  She will put down an amendment which imposes a moratorium in terms of the Second Reading, with which I do not have an issue.  I thank the Minister for her co-operation.  This Bill is for the good of patients but also for the good of doctors because the rogue doctors who do not have insurance are the ones likely to create mayhem, which eventually imposes a cost on everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I wish to briefly mention New Zealand, which operates a no fault insurance-indemnity system.  Interestingly, one of the people to whom I spoke today told me that their system involves rapid settlements of claims with little involvement of lawyers and savings on legal costs.  This system avoids the angst and risk of costly court actions for the claimant while ensuring that the injured party receives adequate and timely compensation but, most importantly, the relevant and necessary supports for them to continue to lead a normal life in so far as that is possible.  That is the key issue.  Rather than awarding vast sums of money, they seek to address the deficit caused by the negligence and the sums of money awarded are much smaller.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The same company that provides legal indemnity to most doctors here in Ireland also provides a service to the doctors in New Zealand under the no fault system.  We should examine that system, adapt it to Ireland's needs and introduce it here in order to save legal costs which can then be used for health care provision at the front line and also to simplify the compensation process for the patient and claimant.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">We expect to pay out €60 million in medical-legal costs this year, €20 million of which will be to lawyers.  It is interesting that the gentleman to whom I spoke today said that most people appear to be happy with the system in New Zealand and the only people unhappy are those in the legal profession.  I commend the Bill to the House and again acknowledge the Minister's support.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Deputy Jim O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_539">I support the Bill, although not out of sympathy with my colleagues in the legal profession, as mentioned by Deputy Reilly.  This is a non-controversial Bill and it should be dealt with by the House on that basis.  It is an honest attempt to close a loophole in our professional regulations.  I urge all sides of the House to support the principle of the Bill and ensure that Deputy Reilly's proposal is put into operation at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">When non-doctors think about medical practice we tend to refer to the origins of medicine, the father of medicine, Hippocrates, and examine the wisdom of the ancients to see the type of medicines they were prescribing at that time.  Of the Greek medical texts the oath of medical ethics for physicians prescribed by Hippocrates is the one that stands the test of time.  Having set up a medical school on the island of Kos, off the Greek coast, Hippocrates established a process whereby new physicians were required to swear by Apollo and a host of other healing gods and goddesses that they would do certain things and not do others.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Some of the requirements in the Hippocratic oath may sound quaint today.  The new physician had to swear that whatever houses he would visit — they were all "he" at that time — it would be for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, mischief and, in particular, sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves.  That is the quaint language used at the time.  There were commitments that they would not give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor were they to make any suggestions to that effect and so on.  There was also a commitment that he would not give to a woman an abortive remedy: "In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art."</p>
          <p eId="para_542">What is remembered most from the Hippocratic oath was the commitment that the new physician would swear to all the gods and goddesses to first do no harm.  In many ways that oath has been re-written through the years to suit the values of different cultures that were influenced by Greek medicine but the basic principle remains the same, namely, that the physician or the doctor will do no harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The problem is that at times the doctor does harm.  That has always been the case over the years, and continues to be the case today.  One has to accept that some injuries or trauma are avoidable, particularly when a person is in receipt of acute care.  That injury or trauma might be the result of the inevitable consequences of the disease process or the unavoidable side effects of the treatment being performed, but in some instances it is clear that was not the case and that the trauma or injury suffered by the patient arose from the avoidable measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">We do not know the full extent of the problem today.  As Deputy Reilly mentioned, the full data is not available.  Studies were carried out in many countries which appear to confirm the view that there is an unacceptably high level of negligent, adverse events.  Some studies were done in the United States which suggest that up to 4% of hospitalised patients suffer an adverse event approximately, half of which are believed to be avoidable.  Those findings could probably be applied here as well.  We are probably no better or worse off.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">If these are the facts, what is the remedy for the patient who has suffered those effects?  The normal process is that if there are negligent adverse effects on the patient, the person is entitled to claim compensation.  In the US, approximately one in eight negligent events results in a claim for compensation.  I do not know what the figure for Ireland is as I do not have the data, but it may not be any different.  We have as strong, or as weak, a litigious culture here as in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">When a claim is made, it cannot be equated to a normal claim for personal injuries.  Where there is a normal claim for personal injury, it involves a healthy person involved in an accident who has sustained some trauma.  Medical negligence claims are more difficult because they normally involve somebody who has suffered a medical accident while probably already having a condition that requires some treatment.  The person may have received the wrong treatment or there may have been a mistake in diagnosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">There is medical negligence where there is a deviation from accepted standards of care and the injury is considered a result of negligence if complications arise not because of unforeseen circumstances, but improper care and treatment.  That leads to the point that the least an injured claimant should expect is that having gone through the medical, legal and judicial hoops, any award given would be paid.  I am aware that this is normally the case but it is clear that, in some instances, it is not.  In some cases, awards granted are not recoverable because there is no indemnity insurance, which is a problem that needs to be confronted.  In essence, it is the basis for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">I am quite surprised that it is only at this stage that we are closing this loophole.  I am not a practising lawyer at this stage but I could not get a practising certificate without proving to the Law Society that I have liability insurance.  If that is the case with lawyers, why should it be any different for a doctor going to the Irish Medical Council?  Most doctors have medical indemnity insurance anyway so there would not be a significant additional burden.  It would help us avoid the rogue doctor or somebody who is scalping the system and not being fair to patients or doctors who comply with the rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">This Bill is not in any way an attack on doctors.  Some 95% or 98% of doctors are doing their job properly and honestly, but we must rope off those who fall into the small percentage who do not do their job properly.  The medical profession would accept there are some people like that.  The president of the Medical Council said openly some years ago that between 3% and 5% of doctors were underperforming.  It is quite a normal or natural position but we should guard against it nonetheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">There is the general question of insurance.  I accept that the clinical indemnity scheme established in 2002 was a big advance which covered responsibility for the vast majority of claims.  There is indemnification and management of very many clinical negligence claims.  From sitting on the Committee of Public Accounts, I know approximately 400 or 450 such claims were dealt with by the State Claims Agency in 2007 so the net is clearly wide enough, although it does not cover everything.  That is the point we are working on here.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">It is useful to consider the scenario in other countries.  As I understand it, almost all the states in America require that physicians have malpractice insurance.  Sometimes the awards can be very big and, correspondingly, insurance premiums can be big as well.  I have no doubt that obstetricians, for example, would have hefty insurance in light of expensive awards.  If that is the case, it is unfair if somebody who makes a legitimate change should then find that because the assets are not there on the part of the doctor in question, the claim cannot be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">There are instances, as have been mentioned by Deputy Reilly, of people coming into this country, staying for a short time and leaving like a chicken flying the coop.  In such cases, nobody is quite sure if the people in question have insurance and the poor unfortunate claimant, who has gone through hoops to secure an award, may have to engage lawyers — a much maligned species who try to do their best for their clients — to chase the people around the world.  This is an additional job which may not be successful if the doctor in question has gone to another part of the globe.  That is the background to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The picture as presented by Deputy Reilly on behalf of Fine Gael is a simple question of regulation of doctors practising in this country to ensure that they have appropriate insurance to practise medicine.  I do not see anything against making such medical indemnity cover compulsory.  This is compulsory for solicitors; one cannot get a certificate to practise without proof of insurance.  One cannot drive a car without compulsory insurance but, to give a gross example, if a person is amputating a leg, there is no compulsory requirement for insurance, although I appreciate that in general there is cover through the State clinical indemnity scheme.  As I understand that scheme, it does not apply to private clinics, so why should the same concept not apply in the private sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I am very much in favour of ensuring that medical indemnity cover is compulsory for all doctors practising in this country.  It is something that can be dealt with by the Medical Council, which should set the appropriate levels, as there is a wide range in the type of cover available depending on the nature of the practice being carried on.  That is for the Medical Council to work on in order to establish the guidelines and requirements to be put into operation before issuing a certificate to practise to a practitioner.  Nobody in this House would be inclined to vote against that type of proposal.  I appreciate that certain modalities may have to be put into operation before matters can be progressed.  However, I hope the Minister will indicate that she supports the Bill in principle.  The modalities to which I refer can then be put in place at a later date.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I commend the work done by Deputy Reilly on this and a number of previous Bills.  The legislation before us highlights the importance of having an expert in this field in the House who is prepared to bring forward good proposals of this nature.  I recognise the fact that the Minister for Health and Children is prepared to accept the general principle behind the Bill, which shows that Members on all sides can, in co-operation with each other, bring forward legislation to close certain loopholes or gaps that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">As Deputy Reilly stated, the main purpose of the Bill is to protect patients.  I am interested in making a contribution to the debate because I am familiar with a case where a patient was placed in an extremely vulnerable position and had no comeback in respect of a mistake made by a practitioner in a private clinic.  Cases such as that illustrate why the Bill is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The Bill is designed to regulate doctors and ensure that they possess appropriate insurance to practise medicine in Ireland.  The majority of doctors posses such insurance but, unfortunately, there are some who, either inadvertently or through sheer carelessness, do not.  It is rather unusual that neither the Department of Health and Children nor the Irish Medical Council knows the exact number of doctors in this country who are not insured.  Even if it is not mandatory in nature, there should be an obligation on doctors to inform the HSE or even their patients that they do not possess adequate insurance cover.  Doctors should do this as a matter of course but, unfortunately, it does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The UK Government sought to introduce mandatory indemnity for doctors and the relevant legislation was approved by Westminster in 2006.  In parallel to bringing forward that legislation, the UK Government also sought to make indemnity compulsory for other health care professionals such as nurses and midwives.  Whether we want to take that route is another issue, but we should consider what the UK authorities are doing to discover if we should put in place a similar system.  South Africa and other countries have also taken steps to introduce legislation relating to mandatory indemnity for doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Ultimately, patients will benefit and doctors will be afforded protection if mandatory indemnity is introduced.  The Bill will enable the Irish Medical Council to set the appropriate levels of insurance that will be held by different classes of practitioners.  It will also exempt different categories of practitioners from the necessity of holding such indemnity.  It is important that the legislation should also apply to the many doctors who are not domiciled in Ireland but who practise in private clinics here on a regular basis.  It is becoming increasingly common for people to come here from abroad to carry out certain procedures on a particular day of the week or perhaps once a month.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I welcome the Bill.  As already stated, I am familiar with a situation involving a particular individual which would never have arisen if the necessity to possess mandatory indemnity had been in place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_561">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation.  I congratulate the Minister and Deputy Reilly on discussing the issue to which it relates earlier today and I hope they will be able to reach an accommodation so that we might move matters forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Insurance, particularly as it relates to private medical practices and clinics, is extremely important.  I am not aware of too many difficulties arising in the context of ordinary private practitioners.  However, I have come across quite a few in respect of hospital and other settings.  In recent days, I met a young person whose aunt encountered serious difficulties in the HSE system.  If one is a certain age, even in the HSE system, one can experience problems in the context of obtaining support and assistance.  I have not read the entire file I was presented with by the young person.  However, I am aware that it contains documentation to the effect that the hospital involved apologised and admitted that a difficulty had arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Regardless of whether one is dealing with private practitioners or the public health service, patients and their families are not really interested in insurance or money.  Rather, they are concerned with regard to the availability of support services in the aftermath of the relevant procedure or whatever.  The woman whose case was brought to my attention is no longer able to walk properly.  Ten months after her first operation, she is not properly healed.  If she wants to go shopping or whatever, she is obliged to rely on her niece or some other relative to provide transport.  She requested a mobile or electric wheelchair but was informed, in no uncertain terms, that it cannot be provided.  The woman lives in an old person's dwelling, which is very suitable because it has been adapted to meet her needs.  However, she cannot go shopping or whatever without asking one of her relatives to travel a long distance to assist her.  The individual in question is not interested in insurance but she would appreciate some assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I am aware of quite a number of problems that have arisen in respect of private medical practices.  Everyone is aware that some doctors come here from abroad — in some instances to fly in for the day — to do short-term work.  The Bill seeks to ensure that such individuals are properly insured and that there will be a follow-up system in place.  If a doctor from abroad carries out a procedure here and then returns when a difficulty arises and states that he or she has no money, the patient involved is left in an extremely weak position.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">I commend the Bill, which is in the interests of both patients and doctors, to the House.  As Deputy Reilly stated, it will guarantee that, for the first time, patients will be protected in that, in the event of a mistake or medical negligence, they will be in a position to claim financial compensation from doctors.  Improved regulation provides better protection to patients, removing the possibility that doctors may not have appropriate insurance or any insurance cover at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">This legislation is both straightforward and important.  I welcome the fact that the Minister and Deputy Reilly may be able to reach an accommodation so that a system of mandatory indemnity might be brought into being as quickly as possible.  Such a development would ensure that people can be guaranteed their rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">It is now two and a half years since the House enacted the medical practitioners legislation of 2007.  This was a comprehensive modernisation of legislation governing the medical profession that then dated back 30 years.  It was a good debate and an important moment in legislating for patient safety and standards in health.  It was clear from all contributions in that debate that at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship is trust.  When one is a patient or when one's family members are patients, one wants to have the utmost confidence and trust in one's doctor not from the perspective of blind faith or deference, but for good reason.  However, I do not believe that people want a bevy of lawyers, legislators or insurers metaphorically sitting in on confidential discussions with their doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">A system characterised by trust, patient involvement in feedback, no-fault reporting, responsiveness to complaints, fair processes and continuous learning is much preferable to one based on suspicion, defensiveness, opaque procedures, blame and litigation.  I believe the clear sense of the House two years ago and subsequently is that Members want health care to be built on the first model and not the second, by supporting trust and confidence rather than relying on blame, litigation and compensation.  I believe Members also share the view that to achieve the highest quality of medical care and trust in the relationship between doctor and patient, it is essential that it is supported by a modern infrastructure that exists outside the relationship itself.  Just as Members no longer believe it sufficient for professions to monitor and regulate themselves on their own, they also do not think it appropriate to rely solely on personal traits and training to achieve a high level of care and trust in the doctor-patient relationship.  Consequently, the Government is supporting and reinforcing quality care and trust through an infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">First and most important in this infrastructure is medical competence assurance.  This means the initial rigorous training of doctors, followed by a continual process of competence assurance.  The Government has provided and supported key institutions with authority and public confidence to ensure medical competence, principally, the new Medical Council and the professional colleges.  Another part of the supporting infrastructure for the doctor-patient relationship comprises clear processes to deal with cases in which things go wrong, ranging from negligence at one extreme to honest mistakes and plain accidents or coincidences of small events.  Even if they are never used, the existence of full professional indemnity insurance, fair and open complaints procedures, fair and thorough fitness to practise hearings, whistleblower protections and so on is critical to engendering confidence on the part of patients in both each doctor and in the practice of medicine itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I believe great progress has been made on these fronts in a variety of legislation and initiatives as part of the health reform programme.  In addition to the innovations in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the new Medical Council, the Government has established the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, as the body that will set standards for health care providers beyond the personal and professional competence of individual clinicians.  The clinical indemnity scheme is working well to provide assurance for patients and doctors alike on medical claims.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, will set out some important provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act and features of the clinical indemnity scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">This year, I commenced provisions relating to whistleblower protection in the Health Act 2004.  The Oireachtas also enacted the Pharmacy Act 2007, which provides for a complete overhaul of the regulation of pharmacy and which updates legislation that went back to the 19th century.  Again, patient safety, continuing competence assurance and the achievement of quality services is at the heart of that legislation.  It is evident from the work of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland in the past two years that this new and modernised regulation is working better for patients and the public interest.  The same is true for HIQA, which in just a few years has made tangible progress towards higher standards of care and higher public confidence in the services received.  Furthermore, the Department set up the patient safety commission, which also gave its backing to the commission's report.  An implementation process is now under way under the direction of the chief medical officer and his team.  A key part of the thinking behind the patient safety commission is to involve patients and their perspectives in the achievement of higher standards.  This idea is based on the insight that, in the 21st century, a grounded, trusting doctor-patient relationship is based on mutual respect and two-way feedback.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">It is in the overall context of the infrastructure supporting patient safety and the doctor-patient relationship that I perceive and welcome the motivation behind Deputy Reilly's Bill.  As Deputy Reilly has well articulated this evening, the motivation is that patients would be assured that professional indemnity insurance is, in fact, in place for every doctor who practises in the State and in whom they place their trust.  I agree fully with the objective behind this Bill.  Patients need the assurance of the competence and professional insurance of their doctors.  The question is how one most effectively achieves such assurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Given the complexities and sensitivities of medical indemnity insurance, the method deserves detailed reflection from the legal, administrative and practical points of view.  This is the reason the Government has tabled an amendment this evening to the effect that the Second Reading of the Bill will be deferred until the end of January next at the latest.  In the meantime, I will ensure that the draft legislation receives full analysis and consideration from all the relevant policy and legal expertise available to me.  I will revert to Deputy Reilly and the Fine Gael Party before the end of next January.  I also intend to keep him informed and fully consult him on particular aspects as I proceed.  I also am happy to include Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">More generally, I welcome this opportunity to work together with other parties on improving assurance for patients in potential legislation.  Our legislative system is designed to be deliberative but our politics are adversarial, often excessively so.  This can lessen the occasions for collaborative, deliberative work on legislation driven by shared objectives or certainly can drown it out in public communications so the public too seldom sees Members as legislators working together on common objectives.  This Bill provides Members with such an opportunity.  I thank Deputy Reilly for introducing this Bill in his party's Private Members' time.  I acknowledge the constructive spirit in which it has been offered and I undertake to examine it honestly and fully in consultation with him and to revert to this House before the end of January.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
          <p eId="para_587">I am happy to have the opportunity on behalf of the Government to participate in this debate on Deputy Reilly's Bill, which proposes the introduction of mandatory professional indemnity cover for medical practitioners by way of an amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  The Government accepts that systems must be in place that minimise to the greatest extent possible the need for patients to initiate civil litigation and thereby avail of the cover which professional indemnity provides.  All Members have a shared wish to ensure that patients are protected from harm in so far as humanly possible.  Progressive policies implemented by the Government have underlined its commitment to this issue.  Indeed, the very Act which this Bill proposes to amend contains a large number of significant measures which at their heart intend to promote the protection of patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I wish to take this opportunity to outline some of the significant advances in the area of the reform of professional regulation.  As Members are aware, the Minister for Health and Children has undertaken an ambitious legislative programme in recent years as part of the health reform programme.  While the Health Act 2004 was the primary focus of this programme, significant importance has been placed on bringing forward legislation relating to modernising professional regulation.  The new Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Pharmacy Act 2007 are now law.  I am pleased to note that work also is at an advanced stage on the preparations for the publication of the nurses and midwives Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The main purpose and aim of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 is not to provide in detail for redress after an adverse clinical event, but to shift the focus entirely to a more proactive system of robust registration and regulation of the medical profession before any such event occurs.  The Act, which repealed legislation that was almost 30 years old, was signed into law in May 2007 following a wide-ranging consultation and serious consideration of the matters which needed to be addressed.  The Act is being commenced on a phased basis to allow for a smooth transition to the new procedures which the Medical Council must introduce.  The main objective of the Act is to provide for a modern, efficient, transparent and accountable system for the regulation of the medical profession, which will satisfy the public and the profession that all medical practitioners are appropriately qualified and competent to practise in a safe manner on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Key areas addressed in the Medical Practitioners Act include governance, membership of the Medical Council, registration, fitness to practise procedures, education and training and maintenance of professional competence.  Strengthening and clarifying accountability is a priority under this Act.  Modern governance arrangements applicable to other statutory bodies in the health service and across the wider public service now apply to the Medical Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">For the first time ever, the new Medical Council now has a majority of members who are not medical practitioners.  This principle now applies to the regulation of the medical profession, as to other health professionals and non-health professionals.  It is important for public confidence that members of a profession themselves do not have majority control in the governance of their regulatory body.  This is paramount to the ongoing development of openness and transparency in the work of the Medical Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The Medical Practitioners Act places significant emphasis on the responsibilities that come with the privilege of registration with the Medical Council.  It is now an offence for a medical practitioner to practise medicine in the State unless he or she is first registered.  Significant penalties are attached for breaches of these requirements.  The establishment of a new register of medical practitioners consisting of four divisions, which came into effect on 16 March 2009, is particularly important.  Most doctors will be registered in one of the following three divisions: specialist division, trainee specialist division or general division if they are neither a specialist nor in an approved internship or specialist training post.  The remaining division is for visiting medical practitioners from the European economic area providing temporary and occasional services.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Under the Act, doctors with suitable non-EU specialist qualifications are able to gain direct access to specialist registration.  Provisions are also included to help doctors holding refugee status to become registered.  The Act provides for a number of routes for complaints and concerns to be addressed.  A mediation process for dealing with less serious complaints by agreement of the parties concerned is provided for.  The Act also includes means for a complaint to be referred to the statutory complaints process established under the Health Act 2004, or to the procedures of another body or authority, or for the referral of a matter to competence assurance procedures, where appropriate.  Openness and transparency in procedures must be demonstrated.  Over the years, it has been of significant concern that fitness to practise procedures were conducted behind closed doors and that the Medical Council was precluded by legislation from disclosing any details regarding the conduct of inquiries.  Arising from these concerns, the Medical Practitioners Act provides that, in general, fitness to practise inquiries are to be heard in public.  The council held its first public fitness to practise inquiry hearing on 4 March 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The support of doctors and the protection of patients require the modernisation of medical education and training processes.  Provisions on medical education and training have been significantly developed over those included in the Medical Practitioners Act 1978.  The new medical education and training functions for the Medical Council, which commenced on 16 March 2009, also cover the functions of the former postgraduate medical and dental board.  The Department of Health and Children is currently focused on developing policy, evaluation and financial frameworks to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of highly competent doctors trained to deliver a patient centred, high performance service in Ireland.  The Government policy to have a consultant-provided service requires that sufficient numbers of highly qualified doctors are trained in order to meet the needs of the health service into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The Act provides in detail for the Medical Council to approve and monitor medical education and training at all levels.  It deals extensively with the approval and monitoring by the council of education and training for medical students, interns and those undertaking specialist training.  This includes the specification of guidelines and standards on curricula, training facilities and other matters.  The Medical Council has an ongoing role in monitoring, inspecting and approving compliance by medical education and training stakeholders with these standards and guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 makes provision for a new statutory framework, to be operated by the Medical Council, for the maintenance of professional competence of registered medical practitioners.  The intention of these provisions is to ensure that doctors remain highly competent throughout their careers.  The council will be required to develop, establish and operate one or more schemes of competence assurance, to submit it to the Minister for consideration and to develop statutory rules regarding the operation of the scheme, which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act relating to the maintenance of professional competence are the only ones that remain to be commenced.  This will be undertaken when the council has developed the relevant schemes.  The council has indicated that it expects to be in a position to introduce the professional competence element of the Act in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The Medical Council's Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour provides that doctors must ensure that they have adequate professional indemnity for the work they perform.  I welcome the fact that the council recently completed a review of this important guide and I have been advised that it expects to be in a position to launch the latest version to the profession and the public by the end of November 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I refer to the arrangements currently in place in the State regarding medical indemnity.  In particular, I wish to highlight the progress the Government has made on improving the situation for health professionals, including doctors, working in the State.  In recent years we have moved to a much more efficient system for providing for indemnity of professionals in our public health services.  Under the clinical indemnity scheme, the State has assumed responsibility for the indemnification and management of clinical negligence claims arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients.  The clinical indemnity scheme was established because commercial insurers either withdrew from offering insurance cover to obstetricians and obstetric units or were not in a position to provide cover at affordable rates.  This was due to the escalation in the size of court awards and associated costs in cases of birth-related cerebral injury.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The scheme is managed by the State Claims Agency and was established in July 2002.  One of the main advantages of the scheme is that it rationalised the myriad of medical indemnity arrangements which had applied up to that point.  The clinical indemnity scheme means that each enterprise, for example, each hospital or HSE area, assumes legal liability for its employees' alleged clinical negligence.  Claims against consultants were brought within the scope of the scheme on 1 February 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The clinical indemnity scheme has responsibility for developing and implementing a national clinical risk management strategy, including the development of clinical risk management standards.  The clinical indemnity scheme advises and assists participating enterprises on the adoption of effective risk management.  This includes assistance in the development of policies, procedures and guidelines that promote good clinical practice.  Risk management advice is informed by analysis conducted on a central national database of adverse clinical incidents reported to the clinical indemnity scheme by health care enterprises.  Health care enterprises record adverse clinical incidents and near misses, clinical negligence claims and anticipated claims, employer's liability and public liability incidents and claims.  Clinical incidents are reported to the clinical indemnity scheme without patient identification details.  The identity of patients and of any staff involved in incidents is revealed to the clinical indemnity scheme only if litigation ensues.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Clearly, the clinical indemnity scheme could not include private practice by consultants undertaken off the public hospital site.  However, a number of years ago, in order to address a serious emerging issue whereby cover was either unavailable or withdrawn for obstetric services, the Government undertook measures to ensure that the cost of professional indemnity cover for consultants working in private practice remained available and affordable.  This was done by capping the amount of cover that doctors need to purchase and providing a State-backed indemnity over and above that limit.  This important system has worked extremely well in making professional indemnity insurance much more accessible and affordable for the medical profession.  The level of these caps has been independently reviewed on two separate occasions and has been found to continue to achieve the Government's aims on its introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I look forward to listening to the debate and the many views that will be put forward on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_603">I welcome the opportunity to speak.  I thank Deputy Reilly for publishing the legislation.  The Government is pleased with the principle of the legislation and Members will resolve that the Bill be read a second time tomorrow evening, in line with what the Deputy proposed.  It can be considered in January 2010.  It is good to see general agreement on this issue, notwithstanding that a number of details must be worked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The Bill seeks to regulate doctors so they have the appropriate insurance in order to practise medicine in Ireland.  We live in a litigious society and insurance is important.  Nobody could engage in medical activities without such cover because it would be an enormous risk to himself or herself and to his or her patients if something went wrong.  As was pointed out, medical indemnity cover is to be compulsory for medical practitioners who are specified by the Medical Council as requiring such cover.  I agree with the principle of this but I wonder whether the Medical Council is the best arbiter of these issues.  Many of these cases can end up in court and judges may take a different view to the Medical Council as to the level of cover required.  Some of these issues will have to be put on a statutory footing to ensure the courts have clear guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I do not normally mention courts when discussing legislation but inevitably when things go wrong some of these cases end up in court.  This is one of the main points I want to discuss with regard to education and training and risk assessment and analysis by the HSE.  I also want to draw attention to differentiating between the role of the Department, which will pass the legislation, and the HSE, which will be involved in its implementation through its employment of doctors, consultants and other professionals in the health services and ensuring that the taxpayers' interest is well-covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">When considering much of the legislation which comes before us in the Dáil one's personal experience as a TD in a constituency can be invaluable in contributing to a debate such as this.  I have seen a significant change of emphasis in the HSE with regard to risk assessment and analysis.  In my early days as a TD I was aware of many cases that went to court because something went seriously wrong and people ended up with a difficulty for the rest of their lives — or it might have been a temporary situation where something went wrong for example in the delivery of a child where the mother was not satisfied with the outcome — and people sought information and there was a clam-up.  People then sought information under the Freedom of Information Act but still could not get all of the answers they sought.  Bitterness crept in because they felt something was covered up or hidden.  They then engaged solicitors and once solicitors get involved an issue takes on a life of its own and the possibility of good communication and talks stops at that stage.  I know the State Claims Agency now deals with all of these cases but historically it did not and many difficulties were created.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I have been impressed by some cases of which I am aware because of local people approaching me as a TD when they were not satisfied with a situation.  Often, all people want is an explanation of what happened and what went wrong.  There has been reluctance in the system to provide that information because of fears that it will lead to admissions of guilt or negligence which will open the floodgates.  It is a vicious circle because this fear prevents those in the HSE assessing the case from providing information to a patient and the lack of this information provokes the patient to step up activity.  One of the most important things we need to do is break this vicious circle.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">We must improve the communication skills of doctors.  Notwithstanding the significant improvements made in this area in recent years, many people going to a doctor are numbed if they receive bad news and when they go home and try to explain it to their families they do not remember exactly what was said.  It is a very basic point but people should write down their questions before they visit a doctor because they will forget to ask the very obvious questions.  I know it sounds strange to state this but everybody knows it from his or her own experience.  One will ring a consultant's secretary the following day and explain that one meant to ask a particular question and ask the consultant to phone back.  However, he or she is busy and the treadmill goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I agree with the principle of the legislation before us.  It is important that there is proper indemnity and insurance and I accept the role being outlined in the Bill.  The establishment of the implementation steering group this year to drive implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance, many of which will require legislative change, is to be welcomed and I look forward to that happening in due course.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanConnick" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Deputy Seán Connick</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I welcome the Bill.  The main thrust of Deputy Reilly's Bill is to provide for insurance requirements for medical practitioners in Ireland.  The clinical indemnity scheme, which was established in 2002, plays an important role in the provision of professional indemnity in the public health care system.  Through the clinical indemnity scheme, the State is responsible for negligence claims arising from the care and treatment of patients in public health care.  Up to the establishment of the clinical indemnity scheme, each defendant in a clinical negligence case, such as the hospital, doctor, nurse, consultant and health board, had separate legal representation.  This was due to the diverse insurance and indemnity schemes of which each was part.  This significantly increased legal costs, added to the time it took to process a case and led to many insurance providers either refusing certain types of cover or offering it at vastly increased premiums.  This was a particular concern for hospitals with obstetric units and for obstetricians and gynaecologists due to the increasing costs and amount of cases arising from birth-related cerebral dysfunction.  Under the clinical indemnity scheme, each hospital or HSE area, depending on the circumstances, now assumes liability for its employees' alleged negligence.  This has provided us with a far more cost-effective system of professional indemnity within the public health care system.  The clinical indemnity scheme plays an important role in our public health care system and the House should recognise and support the State Claims Agency in implementing it.  However, we have to recognise that the structure of the clinical indemnity scheme is based on enterprise liability and as such it is not an insurance based scheme.  As a result, we need clarification as to whether the clinical indemnity scheme would fall foul of Deputy Reilly's Bill if it was passed into legislation by the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Deputy Reilly's Bill proposes that the Medical Council should regulate for the form and level of medical indemnity cover required by each medical practitioner practising in Ireland.  As things stand, the Medical Council's guide to ethical conduct and behaviour states that, "Doctors must ensure that they have adequate professional indemnity for the work they perform".  I have a concern about the ability of the Medical Council to adjudicate on what is the appropriate minimum sum of indemnity necessary for each class of medical practitioner, as it would be required to do under the Bill.  A similar provision was passed in a Bill in Britain in 2006 which required medical practitioners to hold an adequate and appropriate indemnity arrangement.  The General Medical Council, which is Britain's version of our Medical Council, has established an expert working group to advise on what constitutes an adequate and appropriate indemnity.  After two years of deliberations, this expert working group has yet to resolve what looks like such a simple issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">On reading the Bill I freely admit there is merit in a number of the proposals which have been put forward.  The issue of medical indemnity is one which poses a serious challenge to medical practitioners throughout the world.  We certainly do not want to find ourselves in a position where patients who suffer from the negligent acts of medical practitioners discover that the practitioners concerned do not have an adequate level of medical cover or even worse, no insurance at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Deputy Reilly's stated aim of ensuring that we do not allow practitioners, particularly those from abroad, to practise in this country without insurance is certainly admirable.  However, I do not believe we should divorce the sole issue of medical indemnity from the wider issue of the general standards of patient care and quality assurance which we expect of medical practitioners in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance has advanced a very clear strategy for the future direction of patient care in Ireland.  This group has made 134 recommendations which it wants to see adopted.  Among these recommendations are proposals on the licensing of public and private health care providers and proposals for the introduction of a system of privileging of health care professionals.  An implementation steering group has been established to commence the implementation of the commission's recommendations and its first report is due to be published shortly.  I welcome the recommendations of the commission and feel they will make a significant contribution to the standard of health care provided.  I also acknowledge the work being done by the implementation review group, which is chaired by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children.  I look forward to seeing its first progress report and to seeing how it proposes to turn the commission's recommendations into practical solutions to our health care needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">I begin by adding to the collaborative atmosphere in the House by stating the Labour Party also supports Deputy Reilly's legislation and congratulates him on introducing it.  I must comment on the fact that unfortunately when the 9 o'clock news is shown tonight this element of collaboration in the Chamber will not be the top item coming from this building.  That said, it is positive and perhaps there is much more of it here than the public ever realises.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I am somewhat surprised no EU directive is in place in this area, as much legislation emanates from the EU in attempts to regularise what occurs in different member states.  In the past, we all used to travel with our E111 forms.  The E112 card allows one to travel from one member state to another to avail of medical treatment if they cannot obtain it at home.  Considering there are many EU-backed opportunities to travel for different health care and treatments, I am somewhat surprised there is no overall standard in medical professional indemnity coming from the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">There is more movement of persons seeking treatment and of medical practitioners practising in other countries.  This does not just apply to within the EU.  I knew of a person from the Limerick area who, sadly, died in the United States when having cosmetic surgery some years ago.  People do travel outside of the EU to have various cosmetic medical procedures.  This legislation does not cover the dental area but many people are travelling for dental procedures to various countries.  I am not sure whether they are covered by an indemnity scheme.  If not, I would hope it could be incorporated in the legislation in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">We live in a world in which there is much commodification of medical care and where procedures are an item people buy in the private sector rather than getting treatment in a public system in which doctors work for the public good, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said earlier.  This is part of the driving force behind Deputy Reilly's legislation.  Medical practitioners, some of whom do not live in the State, carry out certain medical procedures but are not adequately covered by insurance.  It is important this piece of the jigsaw is in place.  The Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, outlined what procedures are already in place.  The obligation to have clinical indemnity is not on the Statute Book but should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I was impressed with the New Zealand system of no-fault indemnity when the Committee on Health and Children received a presentation on it.  It makes much sense and is one we should be considering.  It is built on trust between patients and doctors and the kind of principles that guide people who work in the medial profession.

          <p eId="para_623">——would be better spent in the overall health budget.  As Members are only too aware of the various areas in which more moneys need to be spent, I will not list them.  The New Zealand system should be examined with a view to introducing it in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Minister of State said the Medical Council's guide to ethical conduct and behaviour provides that doctors must ensure they have adequate professional indemnity for the work they perform.  The problem is that it is only a guide, not obligatory.  It is therefore possible for people to ignore or not to be aware of this guide.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Several speakers referred to the large costs involved in indemnity in obstetrics where mistakes have been made.  Very often they are not actual mistakes but misadventures surrounding a child's birth.  The claims are large because of the long-term effect for a child.  The clinical indemnity scheme has been a way of addressing the difficult issues in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, does a very good inspection job but primarily deals with public health institutions.  There is an urgent need to regulate private medicine.  With the current spirit of collaboration, I should perhaps not have a go at the political ideology of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, with regard to co-location and the encouragement of private medicine across the system.  It is a matter that profoundly disturbs me, however, and is not in accordance with the Labour Party's philosophy.  If much more private medical care is to be introduced in the system, it must be properly regulated and controlled.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In the past week I have noted an advertisement for a certain private hospital's cancer services.  While the State is rationalising cancer services into eight specialist centres, with large demonstrations against such moves, especially in the north west, it seems a private hospital can have the numbers of patients going through its cancer services which are nowhere near the critical mass we are told are essential in cancer care.  It is urgent there is proper monitoring, control and investigation of private health care providers.  Many small private health care units can go on their merry way without any great investigation or inspection from the State.  That does no service to their patients.  In many cases, people pay high private insurance premia when they could get much better cover if they stuck with the public health system.  People, however, go into the private system because they can buy attention and care faster in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Deputy Reilly's Bill addresses private practitioners who carry out procedures in this country but who may not have adequate cover.  They tend to be practising in areas that would not be normally dealt with in the acute hospital services.  They are, however, increasingly becoming a feature of this country's and other countries' health systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I note the Minister will accept Deputy Reilly's Bill but her amendment seeks until 31 January to discuss further the issues around the legislation.  While that sounds reasonable to me, this legislation is required and there should be no great delay in whatever deliberations are necessary on the Government's part.  I commend Deputy Reilly on introducing the legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_630">I welcome this Bill and urge the Government not to oppose its passing Second Stage.  The practice has grown up, a very negative and unwelcome one, that the Government almost automatically votes down Opposition Bills on Second Stage.  This Bill should go to Committee Stage during which any differences and difficulties can be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The Government and its advisers do not by any means have a monopoly of wisdom in these matters.  We have heard much about respect for democratic institutions but such respect is not enhanced by a practice where only Government legislation is allowed to proceed, which happens all too often in respect of Private Member's Bills, and Opposition legislation is opposed, even if the Government agrees with its principles and main elements.  I hope and expect that the Government agrees with the principles and main elements of Deputy Reilly's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">This is a health service-related Bill and gives us an opportunity to address the issue of our health service providers and our health system of which we have heard relatively little in the House recently.  The economic crisis, the collapse of financial institutions, NAMA, the massive deficit in the public finances, the exposure of extravagance on the part of those in high office and the growing levels of mass unemployment have all served to obscure the ongoing and very serious crisis in our public health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Since autumn 2007 a regime of cuts has been introduced across the public health services that has made a bad situation much worse.  Frontline health care workers in our public health services, including medical practitioners, are under severe and growing pressure.  In this situation it is far more likely that mistakes will be made, whether through inevitable human error or through negligence, with very serious consequences for patients and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Everything must be done to prevent such errors and omissions.  We must never have a repeat of the systemic failure which led to the horror of the Michael Neary scandal or the symphysiotomy scandal.  What happens when things do go wrong?  The scandals I have mentioned highlighted the need to reform the Medical Council which was a shield for the medical profession rather than a watchdog for the public.  That was addressed to some extent in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  There is, however, a need to address in a comprehensive way the whole issue of compensation for those who suffer as a result of medical error or negligence.  Under the current system people have to take long drawn-out cases through the courts at great expense to themselves, to the public health services and to the taxpayer.  The only real winners in this system are the lawyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">This Bill deals with one aspect of the problem and that is the lack of regulation of doctors to ensure they have appropriate insurance cover to practise in Ireland.  Most people would be very surprised that such legislation is not already in place.  It is also quite amazing, as Deputy Reilly pointed out, that the Department of Health and Children and the Medical Council do not know how many practitioners have insurance, what level of insurance they hold or who provides it.  This is a worrying situation which we must address urgently.  I concur with the explanatory memorandum of the Bill which states the majority of doctors are responsible and carry appropriate medical negligence insurance but, as in all professions, some may not have an appropriate level of insurance cover, either through inadvertence or, sadly, design.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I welcome the intent of the Bill to make medical indemnity cover compulsory for all practising doctors and provide that the Medical Council will have the power to set appropriate levels of insurance to be held by different classes of practitioners.  The Medical Council has no such power and only recommends that doctors carry such insurance.  The Bill also provides that before the Medical Council can issue a certificate to practise to the practitioner, written evidence of the appropriate insurance being in place must be produced to the Council.  It provides for circumstances in which insurance may lapse and makes it an offence to practise without insurance where such insurance is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The precise role of the Medical Council as proposed in this Bill would probably need further scrutiny and this is another good reason for the Government to allow the Bill to take its natural course so we can address the substance of those issues on Committee Stage.  I appeal again to the Government to allow it to proceed through Second Stage and to accommodate engagement by all parties and voices interested in addressing this important and serious area.  It is alarming that someone irresponsible could practice here without the appropriate medical negligence insurance and in the event of negligent or unsatisfactory treatment an aggrieved or injured patient may have no redress to compensation.  That is a very serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Legislation such as this is required to address such a major flaw in our system.  This legislation would regulate the system as far as the doctor is concerned but more comprehensive reform is required.  Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children earlier this year received an illuminating presentation about the no-fault compensation which operates successfully in New Zealand.  I was present and was most impressed that the scheme focuses very much on the needs of those who suffer as a result of medical misadventure.  Their medical needs, family circumstances, employment situation, home adaptation, transport requirements as well as financial needs are taken into account.  In contrast, the system here is more of a lottery with the prospect of either a large sum of money or a dead end at the conclusion of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">In recent years the New Zealand Government relaxed previously strict criteria for access to its no-fault scheme.  Patients who sustained injury from medical mishaps could previously access the Accident Compensation Corporation's scheme only if they met certain criteria.  To access the scheme the adverse consequence either had to be rare, "occurring in one per cent or less of cases where that treatment is given" or required a finding of fault on the part of a practitioner or organisation.  Thus a victim of a car crash could get compensation from the scheme without first having to prove fault, but the same did not necessarily apply to patients who sustained an injury as a result of medical treatment.  The removal of the two thresholds was designed to end the inconsistencies in the ways injuries were incurred and make it a true no-fault scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">In 1999 the current Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Health and Children, was questioned about the possibility of introducing such a no-fault scheme in respect of children born with disabilities.  The Master of the National Maternity Hospital had recently proposed the introduction of such a scheme.  Deputy Cowen stated then that several interested groups and individuals had pressed for the introduction of a no-fault scheme for these cases.  He said that apart from removing the need for parents to sue hospitals and doctors to ensure that the care needs of their children were secured, it would save on the high legal and other transaction costs associated with litigation.  It would also represent a move to a compensation system based on needs rather than alleged negligence.  Deputy Cowen said, "Under the present adversarial system the parents of children who cannot establish negligence do not receive any compensation".  The case for the passage of this legislation is clearly made.  I strongly commend to Government that given the need, it should accommodate its passage and use the opportunity on Committee Stage to make the Bill amenable to its range of concerns rather than reject it at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I am not happy to speak on the legislation before us which has been debated in the House for a number of weeks.  When one talks to people about the Bill and NAMA, one factor emerges, namely, the lack of Government regulation in recent years.  There was reckless behaviour on the part of a corrupt Fianna Fáil Government, and builders, bankers and developers were in the pockets of the Fianna Fáil Party for far too long.  What happened was inevitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Since I was elected to this House in 2002, my party's finance spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton, has spoken in one budget debate after another against Government policy and about what was bound to happen.  One heard what Ministers, party leaders and Taoisigh said in recent years.  Charlie McCreevy told us to party on.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said people who talked down the economy should commit suicide.  Deputy Brian Cowen said we would have a soft landing.  Patrick Neary said we were sound financially.  These quotations are from recent years.  How out of touch were the people I quoted?  This shows how out of touch the former Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, is.  I blame him for causing much of the trouble we are in now.  He had the cheek to appear on "The Late Late Show" last Friday and say he might run for the Presidency.  He said he would think about it because he would be 60 in some months and would see what the story was.  Allow me to give a message to the former Taoiseach.  He would not win the presidency of a tiddlywinks club because people have no respect for him or his past.  That is my opinion of the former Taoiseach.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_646">Let that message go out loud and clear to him this evening.  That man was out of touch for the past number of years.  It annoys me, as a public representative, to consider what happened in the Galway tent with developers who gave €1,000 for a plate of dinner.  Holy divine God.  When people are hardly able to afford a plate of dinner it is extremely annoying to see developers paying €1,000 merely to have dinner with a Minister or a Taoiseach to get favours from them.  That is exactly what happened.  They got favours and that is the trouble now.  People outside this House are equally to blame because they returned Fianna Fáil to power year after year.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Very many people have been blamed for the position they now find themselves in but I feel sorry for them.  The person whom I really feel sorry for is the hard-pressed taxpayer who must pay for the mistakes of this Government.  It is annoying to see what is happening to the ordinary taxpayer who is worried about putting a son or daughter through college, paying the mortgage and putting food on the table.  This person is paying for the mistakes of bankers, developers, the Financial Regulator, and, to a lesser extent, the Governor of the Central Bank, John Hurley.  Mr. Hurley took a softly-softly approach in which everything was okay when it was not.  It has to be one thing or the other.  He was afraid to bang on the door of the Minister for Finance and say we were in trouble, there were red lights and we should take action.  He was afraid to tell the Minister what the situation was.  The Financial Regulator, Patrick Neary, was paid an enormous salary and was there to do a job which he did not do very well.  From a layman's view, this was the man who should have reported to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Brian Cowen.  These people have a great deal to answer for.  We are going though the present situation because of their reckless behaviour.  If one compares Ireland with Canada or Spain, those countries are not in the position we are in because they took action and had regulation in place.  They did not let things or people get out of control because they had stricter regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Regarding borrowings and people getting 100% mortgages, that was great at the time.  People had the new house, the tarmacadam, the new car and everything of that kind.  This Government has not listened to layman's language in recent years.  It is great to receive 100% mortgages but not great when one has to pay back and times are tougher.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">A constituent came to me some weeks ago who was unable to afford to pay his mortgage and was afraid to face the financial institution which had given it to him.  I set up a meeting with the bank, whose name I will not mention.  At the meeting the bank told him that if he missed four staged payments it would be obliged to bring him to court.  That would take perhaps four to six months and he would then be evicted from his home because the bank would take it from him.  At the same time, Messrs. Fitzpatrick and Fingleton can walk away with golden handshakes, not at all worried about the people who are unable to pay their mortgages.  I realise I am not talking about the NAMA Bill now but I am saying what the layman on the street is saying about Fingleton and Fitzpatrick.  These are two of the biggest gangsters ever involved in banking institutions and because of them we have to bring forward the NAMA legislation.  There is one law for the rich and another for the poor.  That is the only way I can describe this.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Prior to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, speaking on "Morning Ireland", Mr. David Drumm, the former chief executive officer of that bank, said that merging with another bank had not been on the bank's agenda.  He also said the bank's executives would see a pay cut next year, no bonuses would be paid and salaries would be frozen.  He said this would result in a 50% to 60% cut in annual remuneration for the bank's top management.   I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, and his officials and I would like the Minister to address the issue tomorrow in his closing remarks.  What salary cuts, bonuses and pay freezes have occurred among the top management in the five banks covered by the NAMA legislation since it was decided the Government would look after those banks?  People in the private sector have taken severe pay cuts. Workers in the public sector have taken a pay cut, even though it might have been an indirect one via the pension levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Tomorrow evening I want the Minister for Finance to address a matter of the utmost importance.  What pay cuts or pay freezes have been taken or accepted by top management in all of the banks covered by the Government guarantee?  Have they received bonuses?  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, will never be President.  The people are waiting and will have the last say on that man.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_652">One needs to regard the proposed administration and day-to-day operation of NAMA as fundamentally flawed.  Those who were proportionally most responsible for creating this financial mess are now at the forefront in navigating the economy into clear waters.  Once again, it stretches the Government's credibility to breaking point to believe those who have made such a mess of things should continue to have their hands on the levers of power.  This is becoming a sick Irish cliché — absolutely no accountability and no responsibility, an <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> system of government.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">An important consideration in planning for the future of the economy must be a proper review of why this occurred and why it was allowed to occur.  An inquiry has been mooted by many, including Mr. Colm McCarthy.  The Minister for Finance seemed open to the idea, although he was never particularly enthusiastic about or seemingly driven by it, aside from his recent public admission that he shared the public's frustration at the apparent ease with which bankers were circumventing the legal process.  There is a good precedent, namely, that set by the late Deputy Jim Mitchell's Oireachtas committee inquiry into the DIRT scandal.  The House has the tools to carry out this work.  The legislation should create an independent inquiry under the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas to investigate what went on in the banking sector.  Such an inquiry would offer the Minister the opportunity, even at this late stage, to retrospectively bring an end to the practice whereby the banking tail wags the economic dog.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">In his presentation of NAMA the Minister relies on assumptions for his proposal to work.  His figures stand and fall on the assumption that we have reached the bottom of the decline in value in the property market.  I appreciate that this must be done but there are so many variables in his conclusion that we cannot be sure he has called it correctly.  I fail to understand the formula he and his officials applied in arriving at their conclusion in terms of market value.  It begs the question of how comprehensive and wide-ranging is their analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The Minister has made much of merely requiring a 10% increase in property values to allow NAMA to break even.  This is all fine and it achieved the headlines it set out to grab, but it is missing the full story.  If the Minister is wrong in saying we have reached the bottom of the market, the climb to break even for NAMA will be steeper and consequently cost the taxpayer even more.  The rigour of his analysis must be compromised by the oversupply of properties.  Recent reports show that we have enough land zoned to cater for the needs of generations.  The Minister need only drive through any constituency to check the availability of commercial space and land zoned residential.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The supply side of the equation is more than catered for, but the demand side has been badly wounded.  The aim of all of the Government's actions since the last budget has been to quench demand in the economy.  The increase in VAT, the fact that the only costs which are rising in the inflation index are those associated with public services, income levies and many other factors will become more significant as we navigate our way out of recession.  Demand and spending as economic tools are and will become important parts of NAMA.  The current level of commercial rents is untenable.  I have no doubt that retail outlets will become part of NAMA-controlled properties.  Sales have collapsed around the country and the level of unemployment in the retail sector has soared.  However, rents fixed at the height of the property bubble remain the norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">NAMA will not solve the crisis in access to credit.  The economy simply cannot recover without a functioning banking system but NAMA will do little to ensure credit will flow.  Credit is the lifeblood of business which keeps it ticking.  This has been the most important issue facing every small and medium-sized business for the past 18 months, yet the Government has failed to tackle the problem.  Jobs are being lost daily because of the banks' inflexibility.  Confidence in the economy will not recover without access to credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">NAMA is being proposed as the solution.  Yes, it will give financial institutions access to extra funding from the European Central Bank, but as Mr. Colm McCarthy and Professor Patrick Honohan have stated, there will be no guarantee that this extra funding will be used to finance additional lending in the economy.  The four main banks alone are indebted to other non-Irish credit institutions to the tune of €140 billion.  With NAMA, there will be no obligation on banks to lend money.  Their only obligation will be to service these expensive loans.  Therefore, there is no guarantee that the credit for which businesses have been screaming for the past 18 months will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Fine Gael has proposed the establishment of a national recovery bank.  There would be many advantages in creating such a bank instead of NAMA, the greatest being that new State funding for the banks would ensure almost immediate lending in the economy.  Our model would ensure the taxpayer would be purchasing higher quality loans, as opposed to the highly questionable toxic developer loans being acquired under NAMA.  A national recovery bank could be up and running in a few weeks.  The national recovery model has been introduced in France where it has been highly successful, as evidenced by the encouraging signs emerging in the French economy.  The good bank proposal would be the most effective, quickest and fairest way to get credit flowing again.  Even if NAMA goes ahead, we should still establish a national recovery bank to provide for the economy's credit needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Any economic recovery will be based on confidence, but the NAMA proposal does not inspire confidence.  There has been the expected spin on the whole process since publication of the Bill, indicating it is "the only show in town" and "the best option of a bad lot".  The Government has attempted to rubbish other potential solutions with its ideological attachment to protecting those with whom it has been so closely associated during the past 12 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The Government has obviously studied the approach adopted in the United States to the economic crisis during the past 12 months.  The Minister would do well to heed the words of Mr. Larry Summers, director of the US National Economic Council and top economic adviser to President Obama.  As president of Harvard in 2006, he told his students, "Be mindful of those threats that come from elevating the value of consensus, conformity and comfort above the value of truth."  It is impossible to accept that this legislation is based on the truth and I look forward to voting against it tomorrow evening.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_662">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this Second Stage debate.  We need to acknowledge the reasons our banking system is in such a sorry state and the reason an initiative on the scale and of the complexity of NAMA is required to assist the banking system in order that it may contribute to economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Some of the factors are truly global in nature, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.  Those events are completely outside the control of anyone in this jurisdiction.  However, the frailties of our financial institutions were merely exposed by what followed the Lehman Brothers collapse.  The weaknesses were there but they were not apparent and those weaknesses were built up over a number of years, characterised by gross excessive lending, particularly to the property and construction sectors.  It is clear that for many years the Irish banks were accessing cheap credit in a poorly regulated global financial system.  The banks engaged in a frenzy of property-related lending and exposed the entire banking system and indeed the entire Irish economy to enormous risk which has now crystallised before us and is a risk which must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">There is no doubt that the banks became overly reliant on borrowing on the inter-bank wholesale market and moved away from the traditional system of banking whereby banks relied on the level of deposits on their books in determining their level of lending.  The practices which prevailed in our banking system, coupled with the collapse of the global financial system, have resulted in the appalling vista we now face with regard to our financial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I wish to acknowledge the many thousands of people working in the Irish banking system, the hard-working officials, those working at the lower and middle levels in various financial institutions.  They work hard and for modest pay and they are not responsible for the excesses and the gross mismanagement of the institutions which prevailed in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The blame is not solely with any single financial institution but the recent crisis has brought a particular focus on one institution, Anglo Irish Bank.  In his contribution on Second Stage, the Minister for Finance referred to the shameful behaviour of some senior executives at Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I refer to the breakdown of the €77 billion book value of the loans which are to be transferred to NAMA.  Of the €77 billion, Anglo Irish Bank accounts for €28 billion which is the highest amount among the institutions; the second highest loan amount is Allied Irish Bank at €24 billion; Bank of Ireland has a loan value of €16 billion; Educational Building Society has a loan value of €1 billion and Irish Nationwide Building Society has a loan value of €8 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I refer to the article by Simon Carswell in <i>The Irish Times</i> entitled “The Anglo 10”.  He set out in clear terms the details of what happened and the consequences for the Irish taxpayer.  The origins were in the unwinding of the contracts for difference arrangement between Seán Quinn and Anglo Irish Bank.  This was an indirect stake of 25% of which he subsequently wished to acquire only 15% with the remaining 10% of shares threatening to flood the market, as feared by the senior executives of Anglo Irish Bank.  They took action at that time to shore up the share price of the bank.  It has transpired they loaned a total of €451 million to ten customers who are now known as the golden circle or the Anglo ten.  Those ten individuals were loaned sums which, as of last January, stood at between €9.7 million for one individual and up to €56.5 million for another individual.  <i>The Irish Times </i>article revealed that the ten loans totalled €392 million in January 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The real scandal is that three quarters of the sum of money was borrowed on a non-recourse basis.  The only security given for the loans was the shares themselves.  The whole purpose of the transaction was to shore up the share price to prevent 10% of Anglo Irish Bank shares reaching the Stock Exchange with what the executives would have regarded as very serious consequences for the bank.  Those shares are now worthless, given the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  The bank has had to write off €308 million of that €451 million because the loans were given on a non-recourse basis with the shares themselves being the only security.  By its failure to seek any other security or personal guarantees from those customers the bank was utterly reckless in its dealings.  The sum of €308 million which has been written off is effectively money down the drain and is a direct hit on the Irish taxpayer.  An artificial arrangement to buy shares in the bank to prevent them reaching the market is a distortion of the market and I look forward to the outcome of the investigations currently underway in that regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_671">The people responsible for those transactions must be held accountable.  This is not the only matter at Anglo Irish Bank which is the subject of such investigations.  The concealment of directors' loans over a number of years is an extremely serious matter which relates in particular to the former chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Seán FitzPatrick.  These loans were not reported for many years, were deliberately concealed from the market and had a distorting effect as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">A third aspect currently the subject of investigation relates to the lodgement of up to €7.5 billion from Irish Life and Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank, the sole purpose of which was to massage and distort the picture at Anglo Irish Bank at the end of its financial year.  There can be no more serious abuse or distortion of the market than these transactions.  The sole purpose of that transaction appeared to be to improve the appearance of Anglo Irish Bank's balance sheet.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">As a result, the State has nationalised the bank and has had subsequently to inject €4 billion to keep Anglo Irish Bank afloat.  This is money we will certainly never see again.  There is no question but that AIB and Bank of Ireland can and will recover but only a hopeless optimist would believe that Anglo can recover, such is the legacy of damage from its former executives.  Deputies from across the floor of the House will argue that the bank should be allowed go under and the losses should be crystallised as being a better outcome for the State.  This would not be the case.  That option was examined but the result for the taxpayer would have been far more devastating than investing that €4 billion, even with the prospect of having to invest further moneys in Anglo Irish Bank which now seems to be avoidable.  There has to be accountability.  Justice must be done and must be seen to be done in respect of those who managed Anglo Irish Bank in particular in such a reckless manner.  Shoddy practices and reckless lending were not the sole preserve of Anglo Irish Bank but based on the information in the public domain, the lowest standards in financial institutions applied in Anglo Irish Bank.  It would be timely for the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Mr. Paul Appleby, to make a statement outlining the progress he has made on the investigation into these transactions at Anglo Irish Bank.  Last February, officers attached to the Garda fraud squad entered the bank's premises and seized certain documents but there has been no update since then.  The public are furious to see those who were responsible for bringing the bank to its knees swanning around and seemingly immune from the justice system.  This issue must be dealt with if we are to have any prospect of restoring public confidence in the banking system.  I call on the Director of Corporate Enforcement to make a statement, even if only in general terms, about the progress to date of the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">Since September 2008 the actions taken by Government have worked well.  The guarantee scheme was introduced in September 2008.  This helped to stabilise the banking system and the banks are now beginning to raise funds on the international markets independently of that guarantee.  This is the first important step in a gradual process of the banks removing themselves from sole reliance on the State guarantee as a means of accessing credit.  The State will receive €1 billion from the banks further to the guarantee scheme.  None of the Irish banks has defaulted on any repayments and the guarantee has not been invoked in that respect.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have also been recapitalised and the State is receiving €560 million per annum on foot of the recapitalisation of those institutions in respect of the 25% warrants the State has taken.  The State has made significant gains from those warrants because of the increase in the share price since that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">It is important to point out that none of this has been painless for the banks either.  The share prices of the main banks have effectively collapsed despite a small recovery in recent times.  In addition, subordinated bondholders have also been hit with a large amount of subordinated debt bought back by the banks in recent months at a significant discount.  The outcome of these transactions was a loss representing approximately €4 billion to those bondholders and a material contribution to the capital required for the institutions that would otherwise have had to come from the State and, by extension, the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">There is no easy way of dealing with this crisis, no panacea and no painless solution.  We must identify what is regarded as the best solution, move on and implement it as quickly as possible because the reality is we must get funding flowing through the banking system again.  It is an essential component of economic recovery and it cannot happen quickly enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The Minister took a very positive step in publishing the draft Bill at the end of July.  It allowed a robust public and political debate in August and September, prior to the resumption of the Dáil, and I believe we will end up with a better NAMA Bill at the end of this process as a result.  The Minister appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service at the end of August to go through the Bill.  Since the Bill was published the cost of borrowing for Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> Germany, regarded as the benchmark country, has narrowed in recent months, which is welcome.  We could have endless academic and political debate and we should debate the matter at length given the seriousness of the issue but we also need action and we must move ahead with whatever agreed solution is to be put in place.  There is a direct contradiction in complaining about businesses having a lack of credit on the one hand and criticising the Government for bailing out the banks on the other hand.  Without support for the banking system those businesses have no prospect of accessing new streams of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">From the outset and the publication of the draft Bill the Minister for Finance has stated he is open to constructive amendments relating to the Bill put forward by the House on Committee Stage, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The fundamental issue to which we must face up is the overhang of property related loans.  The banks are not confronting this problem in a meaningful and serious way.  They have allowed the overhang of those loans to remain on their books and, as a result, are unable to lend to the real economy or to give businesses access to credit which they so earnestly crave.  NAMA is not a bailout for bankers and builders.  If people wish to portray it as a bailout, then it is a bailout of our banking system which is necessary and essential and I would defend that in any debate because of the importance of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">There is risk inherent in NAMA.  There is no risk-free solution to resolving the difficulties in our banking system.  Much has been said about the risk of proceeding with NAMA but very little has been said about the risk of doing absolutely nothing, the risk of allowing the banking system to continue to be paralysed by the overhang of these property related loans.  It is in the collective interest of all sides of the House to have a banking system that functions normally.  There has been severe criticism of the banks for not lending to businesses in recent times.  However, the banks simply do not have the money to lend.  This is borne out by the facts.  Everyone will have seen the vast amount of money banks have spent on advertising deposit accounts and savings products in recent months in an effort to rebuild their balance sheets, because they do not have access to credit and are unable to pass on credit to the real economy and to the businesses which so badly need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">NAMA will represent an injection of funding into the banking system.  It is structured in such a way that the banks will be able to bring the bonds to the ECB and cash them in at 0.5% above the ECB base rate, representing a real stimulus to the economy.  Each loan purchased by NAMA from the banks will be valued individually and it is important to recognise this.  I welcome the fact that the levy, which is the final safeguard in the event of NAMA making a loss over the course of its lifetime, will be imposed on the financial institutions to recoup any loss to the taxpayer.  Such a levy will now be built into the legislation, an important safeguard.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Much of the public debate has been characterised by a choice between either NAMA or nationalisation.  In reality they are not mutually exclusive because the nationalisation of the banks would not in itself solve anything.  An asset management agency vehicle would still have to be established to clean the banking system of all the toxic loans.  The ECB, on which we rely so heavily, is not in favour of full nationalisation of the banking system.  In such an event the existing shareholders would have to be compensated by taxpayers too.  Many experts have predicted that full nationalisation would result in Ireland's sovereign credit rating being downgraded and would increase the cost of servicing the national debt.  Another proposal from the other side of the House related to defaulting on bondholders.  That is simply not an option either because many of the bondholders are pension funds or investment managers and credit unions invest in bonds and so forth.  Defaulting on these is not an option either nor is it painless or risk-free.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">To varying degrees the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission have all supported the NAMA type approach the Government intends to pursue.  I am not suggesting the Bill cannot be improved because I believe it will be improved in the coming weeks and the Minister is open to amendments which will improve the Bill.  I also believe if Second Stage is passed tomorrow, it is the responsibility of every Member to seek to refine the Bill to improve it and to safeguard the taxpayer in every way possible.  There are risk sharing mechanisms built into the scheme.  Much of the public debate has centred on the issue of the premium being paid for the loans.  This is associated with the long-term economic value, the €7 billion premium or uplift.  The State has warrants equating to 25% of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  We fully own Anglo Irish Bank and the building societies are mutual societies and it is certain we will end up investing further equity into the two principal institutions as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">In effect, €4 billion of the €7 billion premium is covered through State ownership and control.  The State is on both sides of the transaction to the extent of €4 billion from the €7 billion.  Subordinated bonds are being issued to the tune of €2.7 billion, bringing the total to €6.7 billion of the total of €7 billion.  We have the final safeguard related to the levy which will be in the final statute once approved by the House.  The Minister has negotiated a very good deal with the ECB, related to the facility for cashing in these bonds at the base rate, currently at 1%, plus 0.5%.  If the process is managed correctly on a cash flow basis the income received from the performing loans will more than pay the interest on the bonds.  Over time, the proceeds from the loan repayments and the sale of the underlying assets will fund the repayments of the bonds in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Another key issue raised is whether the funding in the amount of €54 billion will be lent on by the banks.  There will be a real commercial incentive for the banks to put that money to work.  If they merely hold on to the bonds they will receive 1.5% interest from NAMA but if they cash in the bonds they can put the money to work, lend it out at interest rates of a multiple of the 1.5% they would receive in the event of not putting the money to work.  It would be helpful in the interests of public confidence to put a clause into the legislation to ensure that money is lent on.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">My final point is related to the area of Oireachtas oversight, which we all agree is fundamentally important.  There are several relevant provisions in the Bill including section 52, relating to the annual accounts; section 53, relating to the biannual report; section 55, relating to the audit of the accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General; section 56, which states the chief executive and the chairman will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the audited accounts; and sections 218 and 219, which relate to the review of NAMA's progress.  It is essential that the chairperson and chief executive officer of NAMA should be brought before the appropriate Oireachtas committee at regular intervals, not just to discuss the accounts, which will only tell us so much, but also to discuss the progress NAMA is making towards achieving the objectives set out in this legislation.  If that requires an amendment, and I believe it may, then it should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Clearly, lessons must be learned following all of this.  There are lessons for bankers, regulators, politicians, developers and consumers.  As a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I look forward to discussing the Bill on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_149">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_688">While I have great respect for Deputy Michael McGrath's views, as a layman I still find it difficult to understand how the State can justify the investment of €4 billion of taxpayers' money in Anglo Irish Bank.  To date, no one has been able to give me an economic rationale for allowing this bank to stay afloat.  I have not heard it from a market perspective, nor have I heard a cogent political perspective to convince me of the need to have invested so much taxpayers' money in that institution.  There will have to be a further analysis of that decision.  I can only surmise that some of the stakeholders in that bank were so strategic in terms of the Irish economy and the employment they provide that if there was a risk their investments were going to be compromised in any way, it could have had untold consequences for jobs in a number of other sectors.  That has not been stated by anyone on the Government benches, however.  I would prefer people to come clean about the motives for such an investment because taxpayers deserve no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">As regards the Deputy's comments on the levy, those who will ultimately pay the price if such a levy is imposed on the banks will be the customers, not the institutions themselves and certainly not the shareholders.  If a levy is imposed, the taxpayers will pay it, thus imposing another cost on the customer base.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">As regards the NAMA legislation, four months ago, a representative from the Irish Banking Federation told an Oireachtas committee that approximately 14,000 people in this country have mortgages which are in arrears.  Juxtapose this with a blanket guarantee, which Labour opposed, and one has a situation where the Government now stands as guarantor for the funds of speculative bondholders in some instances, as well as shareholders in a banking system in a state of paralysis and to which it is proposed to transfer resources in the name of all taxpayers, present and future.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">One of the fundamental questions for my constituents in Cork East is whether legislation of this magnitude will protect home owners who are at risk of repossession.  The answer to that question, quite plainly, is "No".  We are losing jobs every day and liquidity plays a part in that analysis.  More seriously, as my colleague Deputy Michael D. Higgins pointed out earlier, home owners are terrified of the day when interest rates increase as the European Central Bank responds to a slow European recovery.  A wave of repossessions may ensue.  That figure of 14,000 represents thousands of families who live with the fear of repossession hanging over their heads as they attempt to make ends meet.  These are families living in unfinished estates or shoebox apartments.  Young families are sending their children to prefab classrooms in schools too small to cope with the influx of new housing.  They are families who made a choice.  Much like the bankers who will be bailed out by this legislation, these families decided to take a risk in purchasing houses at historically high prices.  Taking out a mortgage constitutes making an investment in property, with all the potential hazards that come with it.  In the main, however, their behaviour could not be characterised as speculative.  Their behaviour was predicated on the basic human need to set up home and put down roots.  The difference, however, is that these families will not be afforded any bailout.  The best that families in arrears will get is a moratorium, a stay of execution that will delay the inevitable proceedings that could see a percentage of them rendered homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">There is also another difference.  While bankers and builders looked to a multitude of so-called financial experts hell bent on hitting financial targets, the people took their Government's assurances at face value when stepping onto the property ladder.  The Fianna Fáil Party laughed off warnings of a recession with jokes about naysayers committing suicide and insisted that we were in for a soft landing when cautioned about the overheated economy.  Weeks prior to the 2007 general election, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, criticised an RTE programme entitled "Future Shock: Property Crash".  At the time the programme was frightening in its bleak appraisal of the property market, but it is now seen as remarkable in its prescience.  At the time, Deputy Bertie Ahern described the programme as irresponsible and inaccurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Why should the public trust those who got us into this mess to get us out of it?  The Fianna Fáil Party has not got the confidence of the people of this country on NAMA or any other issue.  Once again, the people are being asked to trust Fianna Fáil, the party which gave assurances of soft landings and ignored the advice of those concerned with the property bubble.  Once again, its members chose to ignore the warnings, this time disregarding the sound economic consensus that NAMA is a bad deal for the taxpayer.  Any faith the public once had in Fianna Fáil is gone.  We can see this legislation for what it is — an attempt by Fianna Fáil to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  It will continue to prop up those who benefited greatly from the economic policies of Deputies Bertie Ahern, Charlie McCreevy and Brian Cowen.  Those policies enlarged the gulf between the wealthy elite and ordinary citizens.  The people of Ireland do not want NAMA and they do not believe that this Government can repair the damage done to Ireland’s economy, reputation and confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The Labour Party policy on NAMA is predicated on a belief that the payment to a bank of a long-term economic value for loans amounts to a significant gift by taxpayers.  This is a €7 billion gift to the banks.  As CORI and other organisations have pointed out, this is likely to undermine the State's finances and public services for years to come while failing to secure credit for businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The Government's approach to resolving the current fiscal crisis is inherently flawed.  There is no talk of stimulus and the assets are over-valued.  Banks do not have to change their behaviour.  We believe the current market value is the price that must be paid for these assets.  The Government should ensure nothing above the true current market value is paid for the assets in order that the risk to the citizen is lessened.  If the €47 billion valuation is accurate, the decision to pay the banks €54 billion for the assets amounts to a gift of €7 billion to them.  Where is the economic justification for such an action?</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The Bill is one of the most significant the Dáil will ever debate.  The risks to the Exchequer are enormous and irreversible.  Overpayment by NAMA for the loans will impose a major financial burden on the State, yet it is clear this is the inevitable consequence of the Government's approach.  Throughout the banking crisis, the Labour Party's analysis has been consistent in its determination to protect the interests of the taxpayer, while advancing proposals to restore a functioning banking system, supplying much needed credit in the economy at the lowest cost and risk to the taxpayer.  Our analysis is there will always be a risk to the taxpayer but we can mitigate it more expeditiously than Fianna Fáil.  Our approach, based on temporary nationalisation of the two largest banks, would minimise the risk to the taxpayer and provide a potential upside when the banks were reintegrated into the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">We have published our position in this regard and been consistent in our opposition to the underlying culture of greed and recklessness that gave rise to the banking crisis in the first place.  We have always called for tougher regulation at EU level and countered the role of our own Commissioner, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, in completely rolling back the regulatory framework, a process started by his predecessor, Commissioner Bolkestein.  In addition, we have always said the financial services sector would have to be regulated because the invisible hand of capitalism would render the type of crisis we are now experiencing.  During the bubble years we pointed to the dangers and unfairness of soaring house prices, brought forward legislation to control the price of building land and challenged the tax breaks fuelling property prices.  Instead of acting to control prices, Fianna Fáil stoked the property boom at the same time as the party flaunted its relationships with property developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">There are serious weaknesses in the proposed governance structures of NAMA.  As well as the risks and costs of bad loans being borne by the taxpayer, no provision in the Bill gives assurance that a tough, commercial approach will be taken to developers.  The legislation has inherent flaws.  The Bill states the agency is to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State having regard to a number of factors but it vests extraordinary powers and discretion in the Minister for Finance.  I am not convinced these powers will achieve the best financial return for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The legislation states, "except where otherwise provided by this Act, NAMA is independent in its performance of its functions".  In an overall assessment of the Bill's provisions, the agency, in all major respects, is not independent but it must act at the direction of the Minister.  Its function is "to acquire certain assets from certain persons to be designated" by the Minister and "to perform such other functions related to the management or realisation of bank assets that it has acquired as are directed by the Minister".  The power of designation of "eligible bank assets" to be purchased by NAMA is vested in the Minister.  He or she must consult NAMA, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator but the power to designate resides with him or her exclusively.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">This is a flawed process in the context of democracy.  I hope the Labour Party will have an opportunity to address this issue on Committee Stage because there must be proper financial and regulatory oversight of the legislation to ensure it will not be abused if the Minister is seeking to achieve the aim of gaining the maximum value for the amount invested by the State.  The legislation requires NAMA, in the performance of its functions, to have regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister and sets out his or her powers of direction, which are extensive.  The agency is required to comply with any ministerial direction.  The legislation gives the Minister too much power.  These powers need to be devolved to the financial regulatory regime.  I hope this issue will also be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The NTMA must provide NAMA with such business and support services and systems as the NAMA board determines acting on the recommendation of the chief executive officer of NAMA and following consultation with the chief executive officer of the NTMA.  It is also obliged to supply staff and provide NAMA with treasury services and advice.  Other than these functions, NAMA appears to be a cuckoo in the NTMA nest.  While the formula of having consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank is included in the Bill, clearly the Minister is not bound by and does not need to have particular regard to his or her views.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">With regard to the role of the Oireachtas, the Minister is required to furnish an annual statement to the Houses of the Oireachtas but the Bill entitles him or her to omit "any matter that would disclose confidential information".  "Confidential information" is widely defined and could be construed to justify withholding any information the Minister sees fit.  The chairperson and chief executive officer of NAMA must appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and deal with general matters that are specified, for example, the economy and the efficiency of NAMA systems and procedures.  However, the Bill includes a section that gags and prevents them from expressing an opinion on the merits of the policy of the Government or a Minister or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The legislation appears to leave it in the hands of the Minister to evaluate after five years whether NAMA "had made progress towards achieving its overall objectives" and whether a continuation of the agency is necessary.  That should be a decision for the Oireachtas, rather than the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The Minister also has critical overriding functions in the determination of acquisition values.  The Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations to require NAMA to take into account the report of an expert concerning factors or matters relevant to the determination of the value of any property in question.  Under the legislation, he or she will appoint the expert reviewer and the valuation panel.  The panel will review the total portfolio acquisition value and then proceed to communicate its position to the Minister, not NAMA.  However, the Minister can reject the valuation of a portfolio by the panel.  In other words, if he or she does not secure the valuation he or she wants from the panel, it will have to reconsider the valuation.  That is a Labour Party analysis and is something I hope the Minister will respond to in the debate because it is pertinent.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">There is much in the Bill that will require further discussion.  The valuation process is inherently flawed.  The taxpayer will have paid a surplus of their own money to the banks for this process.  The legacy of this legislation will be negative.  The Labour Party had a constructive alternative analysis through the construction of an asset recovery which we felt would be a much more expeditious way of dealing with the crisis in the banking sector.  We felt that temporary nationalisation, with a view to selling stock back into the market once there was an upturn in the economy, was the way to go.  We hope to deal with all of the issues we have outlined on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_708">Before I contribute to the debate on NAMA I take the opportunity as a north east TD to record my sincere congratulations to Deputy Seamus Kirk on his ascension to the role of Ceann Comhairle.  It is a superb achievement for him and for the people of County Louth whom he represents where he topped the poll in 2007, and is a fitting highlight to a 27 year Dáil career.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">I express my sincere appreciation and thanks to the former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy John O'Donoghue, for his kindness and assistance to me as a new Deputy in this House since 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">In all of Deputy Kirk's 27 year Dáil career, and in my two and a half years as a Member, I believe no Bill is as important as the one we are debating.  NAMA will buy loans from the participating banks at a discount.  That is hugely important.  It will take riskier loan classes away from the balance sheets of the banks concerned and make the banks safer and more secure for depositors and investors.  We need that to happen to get liquidity back into the system.  Like other Deputies in this House, I have had numerous business people in Cavan and Monaghan contact me to outline the way they have struggled to get credit, and NAMA is the vital part in the equation.  Banks are hampered in their efforts to lend money to viable businesses, sole traders, potential home owners etc. because of those bad loans.  I agree with Deputy Michael McGrath who said earlier that they just do not have the money to lend.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">There is and has been a problem with regulation.  When money was flush, there were banks that lent money as if it was confetti at a wedding and now we are in this difficult position.  It is unfortunate that some bank employees have been treated in an inappropriate manner in the delivery of their services and duties.  There are many fine people of the highest integrity working in our banks, and we should not forget that.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">There have been many complaints about the long-term economic valuation.  It must be remembered that this valuation methodology, along with all other State aid aspects of the NAMA initiative, is subject to the approval of the European Union Commission.  Banks need access to cash or near cash assets in place of the property loan assets they had previously, which were not moving in the property market.  That is the case not only in my constituency but nationwide.  This will make for more stable and secure financial institutions which will be better able to lend to and support the domestic economy.  That is the crux of the entire debate on NAMA and the reason I support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Every economy needs a proper functioning banking system, and that is what we are attempting to achieve.  Who wants to go to an ATM and insert their card only to read that there are insufficient funds on the part of the bank, not the card holder?  For us, standing still is not an option.  We must take the brave decisions.  NAMA will manage the loans either directly or indirectly so as to obtain the best achievable return from them.  In the meantime, it will collect interest due and pursue debts to ensure its own income stream and recoup the Government investment over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">NAMA, in effect, puts itself in the place of the bank that originated the loan and will have all the same rights to pursue debts where necessary.  Borrowers who continue to meet their contractual obligations have no reason to worry — their rights are fully protected.  We do not want to create another administrative monster and therefore NAMA will be a streamlined, efficient organisational structure.  It will have complete control of the assets and will make all the major decisions in regard to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Minister noted that it is clear that an intervention of this scale in the banking market is bound to have considerable implications, both for the institutions individually and for the broader structure of the banking system.  The Minister said these implications are being considered and may, as indicated earlier, include implications for capital requirements.  These matters have formed part of the broader context in which the NAMA legislation has been discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">These weeks of debate on NAMA have given market participants, public representatives and the public themselves an opportunity to digest the detailed and comprehensive nature and content of the Bill and they allow me, as a Deputy from Cavan-Monaghan, to speak on this most important Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">For the sake of clarity I wish to point out the principal features of the Bill.  NAMA will buy the appropriate assets of the participating institutions.  The price will not be the book value of the loans but will include an appropriate write down which the participating institutions will have to reflect in their books.  NAMA will purchase the assets through the issue to the banks of Government securities and-or guaranteed securities issued by NAMA.  The replacing of property related loans with Government bonds will strengthen the balance sheets of the banks which will increase their capacity to access liquidity in the financial markets and, if necessary, through the Eurosystem liquidity operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The principles of the valuation methodology are set out in the legislation, and the Minister will be making detailed regulations based on these principles.  The methodology will recognise that the current market for property backed loans and the underlying assets are very illiquid and will not require the banks to accept "fire-sale" values, nor will it be guided in its pricing by the property prices and expectations regarding property prices that underpinned the original lending decision.  It will aim to set a reasonable price having regard to a longer term perspective on the property market.  The valuation methodology and the scheme as a whole will require EU state aid approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">NAMA will set the price it is prepared to pay for assets, not the banks, the builders or the vested interests.  That will be done for the good of the Irish taxpayer.  In acquiring loans, NAMA will have all necessary powers to carry out full due diligence and acquire all necessary information.  Participating institutions are obliged to act in good faith and comply with appropriate directions from NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">NAMA will have all the powers necessary to purchase, hold and dispose of assets and, if necessary, complete developments with a view to achieving an optimum return to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">NAMA will be accountable to the Oireachtas in the usual manner.  The agency will report to the Minister, reports will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and NAMA accounts will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Various legislative exemptions and variances have been provided to enable NAMA complete its work as efficiently as possible.  To deal with the danger that persons might seek to impede NAMA's operation in particular ways, NAMA has been provided with limited powers to obtain property or interest compulsorily.  Where litigation arises in respect of NAMA's operations, provisions have been made to ensure this does not unduly obstruct NAMA's efficient operations and such litigation proceeds without delay.  NAMA will be provided with powers necessary to enforce the security on loans, including the appointment of statutory receivers, and to be vested with ownership of the underlying asset where appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Institutions may apply to the Minister to be designated as participating institutions.  The draft text includes objective and non-discriminatory criteria which must be taken account of for designation and these include systemic importance to the State, other State supports available to the institution, maintenance of financial stability and facilitating the flow of credit to the economy.  In volunteering for participation, an institution will be required to confirm that it will accept the designation of eligible assets by NAMA and will accept the NAMA valuation of those assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">Eligible assets for transfer to NAMA will include the land and development books and associated loans.  Associated loans will be those loans which are not in the land and development category but which are held by individuals or companies that also have land and development exposures or where the borrower may be a systemic risk to the financial system.  Associated loans will take account of cross-collateralisation and other associated loan exposures of borrowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I want to mention the anger felt by members of the public for the bankers who have erred.  This anger is justified and it is important we allow the investigations to continue.  There will be a day of reckoning when a banker or bankers will face the full rigours of the law.  At that stage natural justice will be seen to be done as certain individuals have damaged our reputation as a country and for that they must pay the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">This Bill is necessary.  We would prefer not to be where we are but this Government would be abdicating its duties if it did not seek to take the necessary tough decisions for the good of this country.  We are not bailing out bankers or developers.  We are bailing out nothing except this economy.  We must get it moving again and NAMA is the best and only show in town.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterKellyFF" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Deputy Peter Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_727">I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Seamus Kirk on his new job, which he fully deserves.  I also thank Deputy John O'Donoghue for the help and courtesy he has shown me at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The National Asset Management Agency will buy assets from banks, thereby taking the riskier loans off bank balance sheets and making banks safer and more secure for depositors and investors.  This is the best approach to ensure stability in our financial system and free banks to lend to businesses and households.  NAMA will buy loans at a discount of about 30%.  It will do so on the basis of individual loan valuations carried out by experts and subject to European Commission approval.  The payment for the loans will be in the form of Government bonds.  NAMA will manage these loans either directly or indirectly to obtain the best achievable return from them.  In the meantime, it will collect interest due and pursue debts owed by developers.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has pledged that the full rigours of the law will be applied to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">We all know property and land prices are depressed.  Owners of these assets will not be able to sell land or property until prices increase in an economic recovery.  However, the economy will not recover unless the banks are able to lend to businesses and households once again.  Banks cannot access funds to lend money given the uncertainty of the value of loans on balance sheets.  This prevents prospective buyers entering the market, which ensures asset prices remain depressed.  By establishing NAMA the Government is trying to unlock this catch-22.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">We have no other option.  We must address the health and stability of our banking system to ensure the credit required by the economy is provided and people's savings are protected.  Banks need to be able to access cash so that they can lend this cash to viable businesses and households.  At the moment, concerns about the impact of risky loans on the banking system are creating funding difficulties for the banks and restricting the flow of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The replacing of property related loans with Government bonds will remove uncertainty about the soundness of banks' balance sheets.  This will increase their capacity to access funds in the financial markets and, if necessary, from the ECB.  This response will ensure the banking system's safety, stability and capability to lend, all of which are crucial for economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">NAMA is not a bailout for banks or developers.  It is about getting the banks to a position where they can start lending to families and businesses once more.  Banks will suffer substantial losses on the sale of assets to NAMA.  It is not a rescue vehicle for developers or other borrowers as NAMA will expect to be repaid in exactly the same way as a bank would.  NAMA is not about restoring the property bubble prices of 2007 and it is estimated that NAMA will have to achieve an uplift of less than 10% over the current market values on its assets over ten years to break even.  Furthermore, there will be a fund available to allow some half-finished construction works to be completed.  This is good news for those in new estates where work is unfinished, thereby making it even more difficult to sell remaining houses and apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Naturally, there has been concern about what safeguards will be put in place to protect the taxpayer.  Under the Bill there will be no easy terms available to borrowers from NAMA.  All borrowers will be pursued by NAMA for their debts and it will be a crime for anyone to lobby NAMA in regard to any of its decisions.  Only a borrower and his or her agents will be authorised to deal with NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The legislation has been changed to require more frequent reporting by the agency and the Minister for Finance to the Oireachtas.  Any involvement by borrowers in the development or completion of property acquired by NAMA will be subject to strict limits and controls.  Under the Bill there will be no easy terms available to borrowers from NAMA, and all of these will be pursued for their debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">NAMA is not expected to make a loss over the long term but if it does, financial institutions will be levied.  The Government is not bailing out the banks but is bailing out the economy.  In the absence of a functioning banking sector, everything people have worked so hard for would be placed at risk.  It is for this reason I will be voting for the speedy implementation of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Bankers — I do not include staff at branch level in this — have let this country down.  There is no excuse for greed.  We now have a duty, for the good of the economy, to restore confidence in the banking system.  It is estimated that the value of the bank loans to be taken over by NAMA is approximately €77 billion.  NAMA is supposed to pay €54 billion for these and, as a result, the banks will suffer a loss of €23 billion.  The banks are rightly sharing the losses.  After all, it was they who engaged in approving crazy loans in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The purpose of this legislation is to ensure the banks lend again.  The European Central Bank, not taxpayers, will put up the money in respect of this matter.  If NAMA covers its costs over ten years, taxpayers will pay nothing.  If it makes a loss, a bank levy will be introduced to cover this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_738">From 2001 to 2007, loans to farmers increased from €3.5 billion to €5 billion.  During the same period, property developments increased from approximately €5 billion to in the region of €80 billion.  That is the key point in respect of this matter.  In addition, there was no regulation or oversight during the period to which I refer.  The proposal to rectify the position involves the establishment of a State-run monopoly property management agency, NAMA, which will give €54 million to the banks to shore up their balance sheets.  That is a huge amount of money to pay to five banks and building societies in respect of non-paying loans.  The bill in respect of NAMA's running costs and interest repayments remains unknown.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">There are four fundamental issues which should be of concern to every citizen.  First, the best experts available have not been engaged to carry out an in-depth analysis of NAMA's impact on the financial and social sectors.  The Government has not considered any alternative, including the Fine Gael proposal in respect of a national recovery bank.  Until now, the only discussion regarding proposals relating to NAMA took place in the media and at the last week's negotiations on the programme to rescue the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The second issue relates to the €7 billion difference between the €54 billion the Government will pay the banks and the €47 billion — and dropping — estimated value of the properties involved.  This is a direct and indefensible premium payment to the banks at a time when basic services and special needs supports have been cut.  In addition, there is no protection for taxpayers regarding further hidden losses.  If a fire sale were to take place in respect of the Zoe Group's €3 billion in bad debts, what then would be the position of the €47 billion valuation on the properties to which I refer?  We already know that the two main banks will require further capitalisation to the tune of €9 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The third issue is that the NAMA loan book will be comprised of two thirds land and property and one third investment property.  The Government will, through NAMA, maximise the yields of all properties by debt collection, selling and buying land, developing property and managing rental properties.  This poses a serious question whether there will be a conflict of interest involving the Department of Finance and county councils and other agencies which source and manage land for community.  Will NAMA have a vested interest in stoking a new and equally unsustainable upward valuation of property?  In essence, the long-term prospects for NAMA depend on an uplift in property prices.  For this to happen in the way the Government envisages, namely, 1% per year or 10% over the ten years in order that NAMA will break even, which has been rubbished by most experts, it will be necessary to fuel inflation and directly compromise our ability to restore our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Government has stated that NAMA will not cost the taxpayer billions.  However, I am of the view that its activities will lead to an increase in property prices.  Fine Gael proposes the establishment of a national recovery bank.  Such an institution would have made all the money allocated to it available to businesses to restart the economy.  Under this model property price increases would have followed the economy and reflected people's ability to buy, not the other way around.  The NAMA model is dependent on property prices being dragged back up and people following them.  To put matters simply, this will place the Government in a compromising position.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The fourth issue of concern is that the main job of a bank is to deposit people's savings and lend money to individuals and companies to create jobs.  As a number of previous speakers indicated and regardless of what the Minister for Finance stated, NAMA bonds will be used to shore up the balance sheets of the banks.  The objective is not primarily to encourage them to lend money but rather to place them in a healthier position.  Regardless of what is stated in respect of green shoots of recovery, there is a view abroad that we could be in a W-shaped recession.  In other words, the global economy dropped and is rising but will fall again before eventually rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Fine Gael option of a national recovery bank would provide an immediate, uncomplicated transfusion of funds to those who need it, namely, businesses and individuals.  More importantly, it would avoid the establishment of a State-run monopoly in the property market.  Such a monopoly has complex implications for society which have not even been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The Government's attitude is one of casual tyranny.  It seems tyrannical and casual that we will stump up 40% of our gross domestic product to pay the debts of the bankers and developers.  Sweden only paid 7% of its GDP on clearing bank debts.  A huge amount of the money to which I refer will be invested in two institutions — Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide — which will never lend again.  It is incomprehensible that we would tie up so much of our national equity in two institutions that will play no further part in stimulating the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">What is happening is also tyrannical in that the Department of Finance will become the biggest landowner in the country, if not the world.  At a time when rents should be falling to allow a return to competitiveness, NAMA will be geared towards extracting maximum values.  There is no upper limit on the amount of money taxpayers will be asked to provide to NAMA in respect of its loan book in the event that it experiences an increase in losses.  There is no guarantee that the total amount will be €54 billion.  As we understand it, this matter will remain at the discretion of the Minister who, with the exception of the submission of an annual report to the Committee of Public Accounts, will exercise the only oversight and scrutiny in respect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The tyrannical aspect of what is proposed is also evidenced by the fact that there will be no Government assistance for the estimated 35,000 people who may default on their loans or mortgages.  Rather, the Department of Finance will hound these individuals for every last cent.  Why has provision not been made to the effect that any bank which recklessly provided 100% loans and sub-prime loans and provided current accounts therewith should be obliged to write off at least 15% of such loans?  The banks were reckless and stimulated the property bubble in so far as they actively touted for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Unfortunately, banking became a marketing tool and ceased to be based on sound financial fundamentals.  It became a matter of how large a bonus those engaged in offering loans on behalf of the banks could obtain at the end of the year.  All responsible banking practices and proper oversight mechanisms seemed to disappear. If we questioned what was happening, we were accused of being killjoys and of being jealous because we were not involved in stimulating the boom.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The casual aspect of the Government's behaviour is that the Minister for Finance believes it is fine to toss a bonus of €7 billion to those who have behaved recklessly.  In that context, when one considers the cuts that have been made to vital services, it is no wonder that members of the public are angry.  The Minister appears to state casually that assurances have been given to the effect that credit will become available.  Privately, people in the banking sector will state banks have again become cautious and conservative and will not lend money to businesses other than those which are viable.  Businesses are being told they need not bother applying and then one is told 80% of those businesses which do apply are having their applications approved.  New business sometimes constitutes restructuring business and it fits into a statistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I will turn to some of the implications of last week's discussions on the new programme for Government.  It appears as though amendments will be introduced regarding a levy and a capital gains tax rate of 80% for land acquired under compulsory purchase orders for the building of roads and infrastructure for the greater good.  Such arrangements first were negotiated to compensate people who were losing strategic land.  Valuations are based on the impact on the existing and future landholding and the payments were deemed to be necessary to enable people to re-establish the viability of their landholding units.  It seems the application of a rate of capital gains tax of 80% as a penalty on those who were unable to stand in the way of a decision would be penal.  I cannot understand how any rural Deputy could stand over such an agreement.  The same is true of the sale of sites whereby, perhaps reluctantly, people may be obliged to sell.  One hears of farmers, in particular, who are obliged to sell some of the silverware or their breeding stock simply to pay their bills.  While it is not a course of action that most people wish to take, if they could sort out their financial difficulties by selling a site, it seems criminal that such persons would then be forced to pay a rate of 80% on the sale.  I do not have a problem with levying a windfall tax in respect of vast tracts of zoned land that previously were farmland.  While a reasonable sum certainly should be applied, two wrongs do not make a right and going from a rate of 20% to 80% seems to be draconian.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> discussed seven reasons that Ireland would be left behind, one of which was uncertainty about taxes.  It read:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_752">NAMA and the process of fiscal adjustment have caused major uncertainties, especially in the minds of taxpayers.  No one knows for sure how much additional taxes will be imposed as a result of bailing out banks [These are not my words].  The tax commission report also creates uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">No one seems to understand joined-up thinking is required in this regard.  No member of the Government appears to think of this uncertainty.  When first announced, NAMA evinced a certain amount of decisiveness.  Similarly, the publication of the reports from an bord snip and the Commission on Taxation betokened a certain amount of decisiveness, albeit in hope rather than expectation.  However, there has been no joined-up thinking in this regard and people have been obliged to endure a renegotiation of a programme for Government in which one third of 800 people decided the fate of the Government.  Someone called it a programme for survival, which probably describes it better.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Nevertheless, the country could take other measures.  As I noted, the goal is to try to swing back down to a competitive position.  In this context, we can try to have addressed some of the areas somewhat outside our control.  For example, we are powerless with regard to what happens with the valuation of the United States dollar or sterling.  The value of sterling is having a serious impact on our exporters.  We must consider keeping those affected active, alive and afloat.  One development that could take place pertains to China which has so much money invested in dollars.  Were the Chinese authorities able to invest in euro without risking instability, it certainly could help to shore up the euro's position.  Ireland should ask the International Monetary Fund to revisit the substitution account and create a new international currency in which countries such as China could invest without causing exchange rate volatility.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Ireland exports 43% of its agricultural produce to the United Kingdom.  Yesterday I met farmers as they drove their tractors through Wicklow town.  For the first time ever I encountered a mood of despair rather than of anger.  They are unable to be angry anymore.  This island has a food producing economy and agrifood sector that employs, depending on what figures one takes, between 230,000 and 300,000 people, yet we appear to be doing nothing to address this issue.  My colleague, Deputy Creed, and I produced a draft fair trade Bill to deal with the retail and grocery sectors.  The day after we published it the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced a consultation process on the development of a code of practice.  While some of the soundings taken from the big three retailers have been that this will add to costs, I believe that to be nonsense.  There is nothing to fear in our Bill for anyone who is not partaking in the practices we propose to outlaw.  If the Bill allows for people to prove this, it will not constitute an additional cost and an audit would cost an organisation more.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">In this context, it appears no effort is being made to try to restart the economy.  The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, noted that the €16 billion loss in income constituted a part of the problem that no one in government appeared to be trying to address.  The State has lost income in the form of lost tax revenue from a bloated property sector.  While the property sector was shoring up the coffers of the State, sight was lost of the fact that all other areas were disappearing in terms of competitiveness.  Unless these issues are addressed and action is taken to stimulate the economy, we will not succeed, regardless of what is done to shore up the banks.  Even the 1% rate the Government has identified as being necessary will not be achieved.  Certainly, it will not get credit rolling because we do not know where we are going.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Fundamentally, to allow the economy to recover we must concentrate on those sectors in which we are strongest.  If we regain competitiveness, we have a tourism sector that can compete with most places in the world.  Moreover, we are in the euro zone, speak English and have a natural resource in respect of agriculture, food and energy production.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security which presented a draft Bill to the Government on foreshore licensing.  However, it has been buried between the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and there is no sign of it emerging, for whatever reason.  I am led to believe there is a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change which has acknowledged receipt of the Bill.  However, it probably has been in its possession for six months by now.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">To revert to NAMA, it is hard to comprehend how such an important act or direction for the State to take can be treated with such a casual attitude.  It is a fundamental mistake to overvalue and overestimate.  The spin the Government has placed on this matter evinces no sense of erring on the side of caution.  I have listened to the contributions of various Members on the Government side and this issue is being spun in a positive fashion.  While Members on the Opposition side do not wish to spin negatively, if one considers the Bill pragmatically, the risks are huge.  This is a huge gamble and no effort is being made to take on board proposals from any other side of the House.  Mr. Dermot Desmond of NCB alluded to the need for a national recovery bank, to which the Fine Gael proposal comes closest.  The incentive varies slightly under our suggestion.  The institutions are charged 4% per year to guarantee the bad loans.  To pay that and have access to new credit, they have to lend money to service that loan and pay their ongoing bills.  Fine Gael is not alone in saying that a recovery bank is the best way to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">I disagree with the notion of nationalisation, which is a last resort.  Everyone, including small shareholders, must take risks but the risk seems to be on the public.  For the small shareholders there is some hope that some day they or their descendants will get the value back on their investment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Deputy John Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_760">I wish Deputy Seamus Kirk all the best in his new position as Ceann Comhairle.  I thank Deputy John O'Donoghue for his courtesy and kindness to me while I was in the Chamber, speaking or kicking up from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The National Asset Management Agency Bill has been widely debated inside and outside the House over recent weeks by the public, economists and those who have expertise on finance and banking.  Everyone has a view on how NAMA will work, how it will help the banking system, how it will get us out of this situation and how it will help the future of this country.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, stated: "NAMA will facilitate the speedy removal of higher risk property related assets which are clogging up the banks' balance sheets and greatly hampering their ability to lend to creditworthy individuals and households and thereby support economic activity."  The Government is determined to ensure the Irish banking system can provide the credit and financial services the economy needs for sustainable economic recovery.  This should be fully and properly regulated and supervised in the future.  For this reason the Government has taken decisive steps over the past year to stabilise and reform our financial system.  This is a process that must continue.  The purpose of the activity is not to benefit bankers or major borrowers but to protect the security of bank deposits, reduce the risk to our economy and ensure we have a future based on sustainable economic development supplied by, but not led by, an efficient financial system.  The Government will continue to implement the programme for Government in a way that protects the taxpayer.  It is important the taxpayer is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Having stabilised our banking system, the Government will ensure a root and branch reform so that we never return to the reckless lending practices that led to the banking crisis.  Participating banks will be required to submit detailed restructuring and lending plans, dealing with the key elements of their business strategy.  This will include lending targets to different business sectors and the future balance between the Irish and international operations.  The Government and the Financial Regulator will develop a new code of conduct for the treatment of non-performing loans of small and medium-sized businesses.  The principles of the combined code of corporate governance will be set on a legislative footing so that all banks, public companies and State-sponsored bodies deal with key areas of governance of institutions, including board composition and independence, segregation of the chief executive officer and chair, clear definition of executive and non-executive responsibilities, audit committee composition, segregation of committee chairs, risk management, selection of non-executive directors and sanctions for non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The Government is in the process of drafting legislation for the reform of the regulatory system for financial services.  People are very concerned that the regulatory system in place over recent years did not work.  It is one of the causes that landed us in the mess we are in at the present time.  In preparation for this the Government will shortly restructure the boards of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator and select members having regard to the renewed mandate and focus on the central banking and regulatory structures.  Within the new structures for regulation of the financial sector, a specific executive will be assigned responsibility for all Central Bank issues regarding ongoing oversight of State-owned and State-supported institutions.  The Government's approach to asset valuation within the NAMA initiative is a carefully balanced and reasonable approach having regard to the need to stabilise the financial system and to ensure the economy has access to credit and financial services.  Alternative approaches risk leaving the banking system impaired and without access to funds or capital for future development.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Many Members have come across problems in recent months in respect of the lack of credit from banks.  This applies to small businesses, farmers who had overdrafts and people who have loans for houses but are unable to meet repayments.  In recent months banks have adopted a tough attitude, especially towards good customers.  I do not believe that the banks lack finance.  We hear regularly that the banks have no money but I do not believe that is the case.  The banks are using NAMA and therefore I am concerned that NAMA should go through Second Stage in the House as quickly as possible, while having the proper debate, onto Committee Stage and be enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">There will be many amendments along the way.  Finance spokespersons in the Labour Party, Fine Gael and other Opposition parties in this House will provide many good ideas and amendments.  The Minister for Finance stated that he is prepared to listen carefully to amendments from the Opposition.  This is the way it should be done.  No one has a monopoly on wisdom on how we should deal with the financial situation in this country.  We need all sides on board to deal effectively and quickly with the legislation so that banks lend to those who deserve loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Other Members from Wexford are in the same position as I am, having met people, particularly farmers, who had overdraft facilities of €25,000 or €50,000 in recent years for restocking purposes or other purposes.  They receive a letter in the post telling them that the overdraft facility has been withdrawn completely or reduced by half or quarter.  There is no discussion or dialogue.  That is not good enough.  Where people have proved to be good customers in the past, banks should be prepared to allow them to continue as viable family businesses or farming businesses.  To pull the rug from under people at this late stage in the year will make people non-productive.  This will lead to job losses and people will be unable to continue as viable propositions in farming or small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">It is very important that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment continue to have dialogue with the banks to ensure credit is available.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has this structure in place to encourage the banking system to lend.  Sometimes I get the feeling it is not working properly.  There is a need for a hands-on approach by the Tánaiste to ensure people who deserve credit and who have good repayment records are able to avail of it in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Recently, I received a letter from a person who has been an employee of AIB finance and leasing for more than two years.  Perhaps my colleagues in Wexford received the same letter.  He is seriously concerned about recent developments in the financial services sector and from a professional point of view he is very concerned that while we discuss NAMA, deal with those who owe the billions of euro and are concerned with the income of farmers and small businesses those working in banks who were in no way to blame for the banking crisis may lose their jobs, be left behind and be forgotten about.  He is very anxious that this should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The letter states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_770">I believe that as part of this debate some thought should be given to the future shape and functioning of our financial institutions to ensure that the lessons of the current crisis are fully learned and taken on board. ... Furthermore, in considering how financial institutions should function in the future, it is clear that not only does the industry need much closer scrutiny in terms of regulation, but the culture of banking also requires a major overhaul to restore the traditional values of prudence, integrity and long-term stability. ... What emerges from the crisis is not a damaged banking system sustained by a piecemeal patchwork of short-term fixes — but rather a reformed system underpinned by a comprehensive approach designed to ensure that it can function effectively in support of economic recovery and social solidarity.  Such a system should have due regard to the interest of staff, customers and shareholders as well as the public good.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The letter writer urges us as politicians "to ensure that the considerable outlay of public money being committed to address the current crisis does not become a catalyst for an assault on the jobs and livelihoods of staff working in the financial services sector".</p>
          <p eId="para_772">From time to time, we politicians must call to the bank and speak with bank officials, although the wider world might believe that we do not have to and that we do not have any financial problems.  I know from speaking with people working in banks that they feel very annoyed and concerned that ordinary working people are being made scapegoats for crazy decisions taken by people at a higher level.  As a result, the general public feels aggrieved towards people working in banks and this should not be the case because ordinary bank employees work from nine to five on an ordinary salary and they are in no way responsible for the problems we now face.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The family home is an issue about which I am concerned.  Many people will be looked after and catered for but those living in a family home who secured mortgages to build that home and have lost their jobs in recent weeks or months are under very severe pressure.  A section in the new programme for Government deals with the protection of the family home.  This issue requires much thought and debate as the NAMA Bill goes through the House.  Will the Minister for Finance seriously examine how we can implement a system that will ensure the family home is protected and that people who may find it very difficult to meet repayments at present will receive a stay to allow them to pay back a small portion of their mortgage?  They are not in a position to pay back the full mortgage at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Senator Marc MacSharry and other Senators put forward a number of options to the Minister for Finance, including interest-only payments, permanently extended mortgage payments, renting back property from the lender, a moratorium on fixed rates and redrafting mortgage terms.  I will throw in a further suggestion.  As Deputies Howlin and Kehoe know, the local authority operates a differential rent system whereby one pays rent based on one's income.  It is very important that the Minister for Finance considers, in conjunction with the banks, how a differential repayment system could be initiated for a period of two, three or four years to enable people to make their repayments based on their present income.  When things pick up and they secure a job — as they will — they will return to making full payments.  During the debate on NAMA, there is a serious need to examine a system to facilitate people who are now finding it very difficult to meet mortgage repayments.  It is very important that we examine this.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Some of the mortgages loaned to people were very high.  People come to me who have mortgage repayments of €1,200 or €1,400 per month.  How they ever secured a mortgage based on their income at the time baffles me; it shows that at the time the banks were prepared to throw money at the ordinary public regardless of their income.  Now, when difficulties are arising, the banks want to put in the boot.  That should not be tolerated.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, take back the message to the Minister for Finance — we will do so ourselves at parliamentary party meetings and other fora — that the family home should be included in the NAMA debate?  Concrete proposals should be put forward that will allow the banks and the Minister for Finance to come up with a satisfactory solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Deputy Kehoe and I attended a farming meeting last night where approximately 200 farmers were present.  They were very concerned about a taxation proposal and that the 80% rate might affect land they would provide under CPO for road widening or bypasses.  The Ministers for Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have confirmed to us that this is not the case and that the 80% rate will not be any way related to CPO land.  When the Minister for Finance replies tomorrow will he confirm to farmers that they will not be liable for this 80% tax rate?  Last night, we did our best to confirm to the farmers of Wexford that it will not be the case that CPO land will be included in the 80% windfall tax, nor should it be.  The Minister should keep the IFA and the farmers of the country happy and confirm that this will not happen.  Public meetings have taken place in various parts of the country where concern has been expressed on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">This is about getting people back to work.  We need to correct the country's finances as quickly as possible.  While we hear about green shoots we have a long way to go.  Every 1,000 people on the dole costs the Exchequer an estimated €20 million in social welfare payments and lost tax.  That is a lot of money being lost to the Exchequer.  It is also a lot of heartbreak and job losses are causing problems for many families throughout the country.  Many worked in the building industry and earned good money and in County Wexford we were very dependent on the building industry which employed huge numbers of people.  It is about time we examined how to get the building industry up and running again.  Certainly, there is not a hope we will get it back to the way it was but there is still room for a certain amount of building to develop and I hope it does as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I welcome the NAMA Bill.  I hope it passes through the Houses as quickly as possible and that we can get on to lending to people throughout the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_779">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise an important national issue, namely, the provision of dedicated facilities at Cork University Hospital for patients with cystic fibrosis.  When I checked the Official Report, it is almost a year to the day, 15 October 2008, when I last raised this matter on the Adjournment.  I acknowledge the progress that has been made since in the provision of services and facilities for people with cystic fibrosis.  I also acknowledge the additional funding provided for staffing levels with the roll-out of multidisciplinary support teams across the country.  Significant improvements have been made in services infrastructure, particularly in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin and elsewhere.  I am glad there has been some improvement in life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis.  The Health Service Executive provides direct funding for maintaining a cystic fibrosis registry which now can provide relevant data for 90% of those with cystic fibrosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">This Adjournment debate is also timely with the publication today of the HSE report on services for people with cystic fibrosis.  The report was completed in 2006 but has only now been published.  It followed on from the Pollock report, commissioned by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, which was presented to the HSE.  Many of that report's recommendations have been implemented in the past few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">A statement of need was finalised some time ago for the provision of dedicated cystic fibrosis facilities at Cork University Hospital, to include a dedicated day care unit, with the scope and scale of inpatient beds in a respiratory ward outlined.  Anyone with knowledge of cystic fibrosis will be aware that the risk of cross-infection for sufferers in an acute hospital environment is significant.  Independent access to cystic fibrosis facilities in a hospital environment is important for sufferers to prevent exposing them to a significant risk of cross-infection which can have fatal consequences.  Some progress has been made in the provision of such facilities at Cork University Hospital.  The most recent correspondence I received from the HSE indicates plans are being advanced for an interim day care facility in the hospital which will include a dedicated day care space for adult patients until the overall site development plan is advanced for the permanent provision of facilities for children and adult cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">I acknowledge the work of the voluntary group, Build4life, in counties Cork and Kerry which to date has raised in excess €1.5 million.  I also acknowledge the work of the Cork 65 Roses Ball committee which held a charity ball last Saturday night to highlight the need to improve the facilities available at Cork University Hospital for both adult and children cystic fibrosis sufferers.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">I hope the Minister of State will be able to outline the national position and that in Cork University Hospital in the provision and improvement of services outlined in today's report from the HSE.  I welcome the statement the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland has published in response to the HSE report, particularly that new-born screening for cystic fibrosis will begin in 2010.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response and hope we can provide as soon as possible across the country and at Cork University Hospital the facilities cystic fibrosis sufferers need and badly deserve.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_157">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_784">I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">The Government is acutely aware of the tremendous challenges the 1,174 people living with cystic fibrosis face every day.  The Minister for Health and Children has prioritised the development of services for people suffering with cystic fibrosis and, since 2006, funding of €6.78 million has been provided for the HSE to develop services.  It is particularly important to develop efficient and equitable cystic fibrosis services, as evidence shows that not only are people with cystic fibrosis living longer, but the number of children born with cystic fibrosis is also increasing.  It is vital, therefore, that these services are enhanced to cope with the anticipated increase in demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">To date, the HSE has primarily focused on increasing staffing levels in treatment units across the country and developing and modernising hospital facilities to ensure patients requiring admission can be treated in the best environment possible.  The approach in developing services for persons with cystic fibrosis has been informed by two significant reports.  The first, the Pollock report, was commissioned by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and involved a review of existing hospital services for cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards.  This report identified the need to develop services and improve the physical infrastructure in hospitals which treat cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">A multidisciplinary working group, established by the HSE in 2005, undertook a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The group identified a range of necessary service improvements, including the need to increase the levels of consultant, nursing and allied professional staffing in cystic fibrosis units nationally.  The group's report will be made available shortly by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">Since 2006, many programmes and developments have been initiated and many are completed or near completion.  In Cork the situation is improving significantly for the 110 adult and 80 paediatric patients for whom Cork University Hospital cares.  Two new medical consultants, additional nursing staff, allied health professional staff and support staff have been recruited, ensuring patients can receive prompt and appropriate care.  Plans are also being developed to provide a cystic fibrosis day care facility in the hospital.  This is being advanced in conjunction with the Build4life Association, the adult cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary team and the executive management board of Cork University Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">At St. Vincent's Hospital, the national adult tertiary referral centre, several capital projects have been completed.  The enhanced facilities provided include a new ambulatory care centre and a new emergency department which includes single-room accommodation.  The refurbishment of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis has also been completed and the beds are now operational.  The next phase in the development of St. Vincent's Hospital's facilities will involve the building of a new ward block to replace existing accommodation.  The new ward block will provide single room en-suite accommodation, 100 rooms, with a dedicated day unit for people with cystic fibrosis, including single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.  It is hoped the development will become operational as early as possible in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">Another initiative which will contribute to the improvement of care for people with cystic fibrosis is the creation of data registries which gather information from individual patients and provide a pool of accurate data that can be used for research purposes.  An independent registry for cystic fibrosis, funded by the State, has been established.  This will help to make international comparisons over time regarding the incidence of cystic fibrosis treatment and outcomes for patients.  An epidemiological survival analysis has recently been completed by the registry.  The final report is expected to be published shortly.  Among the many elements of the report is the welcome finding that the average life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has increased significantly in recent years.  Progress is also being made by the HSE on the introduction of a national screening programme for newborns.  A steering group has been established to oversee its implementation and to ensure co-ordination with the development of other relevant services.  I look forward to the early introduction of this important service.  Overall, this package of measures demonstrates the Government's strong commitment to improving the level of services available to people with cystic fibrosis, not alone in Cork but throughout the country.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_158">
            <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_791">I want to express my absolute disgust at Aer Lingus for yet again singling out Shannon Airport for most of its planned cuts.  I was shocked at the extent of the measures announced last Thursday.  There is undoubtedly an agenda at work among senior Aer Lingus management to kick Shannon at every turn.  Why else would the airline refuse to use the state-of-the-art new €21 million US pre-clearance facility at Shannon Airport?  You can bet your bottom dollar that if the same facility were made available in Dublin first it would use it.  Other carriers such as Continental, Delta and British Airways are availing of the service which puts Aer Lingus at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">If Aer Lingus marketed and supported Shannon Airport as it does its new loss-making bases in Belfast and Gatwick, the potential of Shannon and the mid-west would be unlocked.  Last winter 30,000 passengers travelled with Delta out of Shannon, whom Aer Lingus could attract.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">Aer Lingus management is asking Shannon to carry an unfair burden.  The loss of a 130-strong cabin crew base in Shannon and its replacement with a core group of just 20 to operate the Heathrow route is a step closer to Aer Lingus's full bypass of Shannon Airport.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has a very poor record in defending services at Shannon.  This crisis presents him with an opportunity to redeem himself.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">He must intervene in the interest of balanced regional development, of securing a transatlantic base on the west coast, of business and tourism in the mid-west and of saving 102 jobs.  He must use the 25% shareholding he holds in Aer Lingus to ensure US connectivity to the mid-west region.  I plead with the Minister to act and for once to work in the interest of Shannon.  We need to retain the full complement of cabin crew there to secure our vital Shannon transatlantic base.  The Minister's failure to intervene in the Shannon-Heathrow dispute was a big mistake.  He should not make the same mistake this time.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_159">
            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_795">These are testing times for Aer Lingus and its staff, especially those based at Shannon Airport.  The airline's lamp is burning through its cash reserves faster than it can refill them and by the end of the year its cash reserves are expected to be down to €400 million from €803 million in 2008.  Some of the airline management's decisions in recent years have been questionable and have left the airline in a precarious position.  It has spent €180 million cash on the purchase of two Airbus aircraft and has also been a casualty of fuel hedging.  In addition, while it claims that this reduction in cash reserves is due to a combination of reduced sales and high staff costs, I understand it is due to save up to €55 million a year in staff costs from January 2010 as a result of cost savings agreed with staff in the last restructuring plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Unfortunately, Aer Lingus staff at Shannon and the people of the mid-west will once again pay the greatest price for these bad decisions.  Aer Lingus has been continually undermining and downgrading its Shannon operation for several years.  It now plans to shed 102 cabin crew jobs at Shannon which will have serious implications for future transatlantic services at the airport.  Aer Lingus has failed to sign up to use the new state-of-the-art US pre-clearance facility and there is no reason Aer Lingus cannot negotiate an agreement with the US port authorities which would facilitate their Shannon passengers.  It flies into terminal four in New York which has a domestic baggage claim area used by Delta, Northwest and Virgin America operating domestic services and the situation in Boston is similar with a domestic baggage claim area available which is used by Southwest for its domestic routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">Its US advertising campaigns are tilted in favour of Dublin Airport as the two most recent campaigns testify.  It now plans to reduce the New York EI 111 service from Shannon to a thrice-weekly flight.  Bookings for the Shannon-New York service to the end of March 2010 are well ahead of bookings on the EI 105 Dublin-JFK service but I am amazed that the airline plans to operate its Shannon service on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays two of which days have traditionally been poor for bookings on the New York route.  I believe the airline is intentionally running down the Shannon operation to show that the Shannon service underperforms against the Dublin one.  I have constantly pointed out the need for the airline to review the timing of its Shannon flight.  EI 111 should depart at 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock in the morning which would allow the airline to compete for the 30,000 passengers who travelled with Delta Airlines last winter which is not operating from Shannon this winter.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, will tell the Minister for Transport that what is needed now is an urgent meeting with Christoph Mueller who has not had sufficient time to make himself <i>au fait</i> with the Shannon situation and I am calling on the Minister to arrange this meeting.  The Government has a 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus and has appointed directors to the company.  The Minister must have learned lessons from the Shannon-Heathrow debacle last year and I urge him to act and arrange this meeting immediately.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_160">
            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_799">We all know that Aer Lingus must cut its costs but it is out of proportion for it to take 102 cabin crew out of Shannon when it is taking only 100 out of Dublin and Cork airports together.  In the interests of balanced regional development the west depends on having connectivity through Shannon Airport for the sake of industrial development and of the society in the west and mid-west.  With all due respect to him, the Minister of State present here has no brief whatsoever for transport.  That the Minister for Transport did not come to the House to reply to four different Deputies on this issue of crucial concern to the people in the mid-west indicates how he views Shannon Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">I urge the Government to use its 25% share in Aer Lingus.  What was the point of keeping a 25% share in the airline if it does not use it in the interest of balance for the country?  The transatlantic routes are crucial to Shannon's survival.  It offers very few flights into Europe.  There are a couple of Heathrow connections which we had to fight to win back, despite the Government's having allowed them to be taken away.  Transatlantic travel is crucial to Shannon.  I urge the Government to insist that the cabin crew that deals with the transatlantic routes be based in Shannon.  That makes sense.  Many flights go in other directions from Cork and Dublin.  The Minister should let us have our cabin crew in Shannon and a commitment from Aer Lingus to Shannon Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">There is no problem about opening up the customs pre-clearance facility at Shannon and it should be opened now.  I urge the Government to insist that Aer Lingus do that.  There is a domestic baggage claim area in terminal four in JFK airport and in Boston airport.  There is no problem about opening the pre-clearance facility in Shannon for Aer Lingus passengers and this will not conflict in any way with the Dublin passengers.  It is a falsehood to suggest that this is a problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">The airline needs to keep a proper base of cabin crew in Shannon Airport and above all to respect the loyalty of the staff who have stayed with the airline despite opportunities to go.  It is vital to the west that we have air connectivity.  It is shameful that the Green Party while in Government does not stand up for balanced regional development in which it is supposed to believe.  I hope the Minister for Transport will somehow listen to this debate and take this issue seriously because it is of vital concern to us in the region.</p>

          <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_161">
            <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
            <p eId="para_803">I beg the Acting Chairman's indulgence on a matter of vital interest for the mid-west and Limerick.  It is absolutely shameful that the Minister for Transport is not in the Chamber tonight.  When I was elected to the Dáil in 2007, the first issue before the House was the Shannon-Heathrow route.  At that time, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, stated he was disowning the problem of dealing with the 25% stake.  When the Government retained its 25% stake in Aer Lingus, it did so for strategic reasons.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on the transatlantic routes Aer Lingus operated from Shannon to which I got a two-line response stating that commercial operational matters at Aer Lingus are a matter for the management and board of the company.  The Minister has three appointees on the board and he should be in the House tonight.  We all know Aer Lingus has difficulties because of today's world markets but what is now required is a consideration of what can be done to keep a sustainable transatlantic service from Shannon Airport that will involve the retention of the 127 cabin staff based there.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">The Heathrow route was taken from Shannon and Aer Lingus had to restore it because it was profitable.  It made the wrong decision and is now making the wrong decision about the transatlantic routes and the removal of the cabin crew based at Shannon Airport.  Negotiations are getting under way between unions and management.  The Minister for Transport should use the 25% stake to ensure Aer Lingus looks at the broad overall perspective for a sustainable base in Shannon Airport for transatlantic routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">Aer Lingus should be using the customer border clearance facility at Shannon Airport.  Why is it not doing so?  The Government paid for that facility to be based there.  It is a 25% stakeholder.  Why does it not insist that Aer Lingus use the facility?</p>

            <p eId="para_807">It is a comparative advantage for Ireland and the mid-west.  I am a Deputy representing Limerick.  Shannon Airport is vital to us, both for connectivity through Heathrow and for the transatlantic routes.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Transport is not present tonight.  There are 102 jobs at stake.  The future of the region is at stake with regard to the connectivity which is required for balanced regional development.  That is why the Government retained its 25% stake in Aer Lingus.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">It is cowardly for the Minister not to be present tonight to answer our questions.  He should insist that Aer Lingus engage in meaningful discussions with the unions and management with regard to providing a sustainable service based in Shannon Airport with cabin crew based there.  These people have given loyal service over many years to Aer Lingus and to Limerick, the mid-west and Shannon Airport.  They want to stay in their jobs and are willing to work with management.  Meaningful discussions are now required.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">I understand discussions are getting under way tomorrow, with detailed discussions to take place on 29 October.  I expect the Minister to come to the House and give Members an assurance that he will stand up for the interests of the Aer Lingus workers and the mid-west, Limerick in particular, rather than provide a meaningless two-line answer.  We all want to work with Aer Lingus and we realise it has financial difficulties.  Let us look at a sustainable model for Shannon Airport such as was never undertaken by Aer Lingus.  The airline made a mistake with the Heathrow route and is now making a significant mistake with the transatlantic route and in taking cabin crew away from Shannon Airport.  I want the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, who is present, to tell the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, we are not going to go away.  This issue will return to the House and we expect the Minister to answer these questions then.</p>

            <p eId="para_826">Subject to that duty the Minister has mandated the State-nominated directors to seek to ensure that all decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level.  In any such decisions they are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.  The Government is satisfied from all the information available to it that a major restructuring of the group's cost base is essential if Aer Lingus is to survive.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The Minister understands that approximately 100 of the 676 job losses being sought by the company will be at its Shannon Airport base.  Job losses are particularly regrettable in the current economic climate and the Minister and I have every sympathy for those whose jobs are on the line.  The Minister understands a consultation process between management and staff is now under way and he encourages all parties to engage constructively in that process.  The industrial relations mechanisms of the State are available to assist in reaching an agreed outcome for all concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">From an aviation policy perspective, the cornerstones of Government aviation policy are competitiveness and connectivity.  A viable Aer Lingus is key to ensuring the achievement of these objectives.  In Ireland, our priority now is to ensure we can sustain continued air access to key business and tourism markets.  Competition among airlines serving the Irish market has been the cornerstone of our aviation policy resulting in dramatic growth in air services and passenger numbers over the past ten to 15 years until the advent of the global downturn.  The best way to maximise Ireland's air connectivity is to see Aer Lingus returned to a stable footing to allow it to compete aggressively in the current very difficult market environment.  This is a difficult time for Aer Lingus.  I ask all stakeholders and regional interests to lend their support to the airline to ensure it has a viable independent future for the benefit of tourism, business and the country's economic recovery.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_830">I wish to share time with Deputies Howlin and Kehoe whom I know share my concern regarding the matter I raise.  I am happy they should have an opportunity to express their concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">I raise the kidnapping of Father Michael Sinnott who is from Barntown near Clonard, an area I know well for many different reasons.  It is a fundamental fact that the kidnapping of an Irish citizen who has worked abroad in such a distinguished way for nearly five decades, as Father Sinnott has done, is something that affects all of us.  Father Sinnott's Columban community has expressed its concern but I wanted us, as a Parliament, to join the Columbans in saying we wish to convey to the Filipino community and the breakaway group in Mindanao that we are affected.  Everyone in Ireland is affected by the kidnapping of Father Sinnott, a man aged 80, who has very special medical needs.  His community has appealed to those who may be holding him to deal immediately with the authorities and negotiate so that his medical needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">That this is not a party political matter is important, as we all share a concern.  Ambassador Richard O'Brien has flown to the Philippines and is in touch with those who are seeking to discover Fr. Sinnott's whereabouts.  This is a difficult time for his family and companions in the Columban order.  I know a number of individuals in the order.  They are distinguished as people who have entered problematic areas, be they in Peru or the Philippines.  What is interesting is that Fr. Sinnott is one of those who sought to transcend cultural, ethnic and religious differences, being as he was part of the inter-faith dialogue.  In addition, some in the Islamic community have issued statements to the effect that they are appalled by his kidnapping in so far as he had assisted some of the weakest people.  In 1998 he founded a school for children with intellectual disabilities.  He is regularly photographed among the community and has enjoyed the support and love of people of different religious beliefs.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">I raise this matter only to send messages, however they might be delivered, abroad and at home.  One message is to the Columban community and Fr. Sinnott's family to the effect that we are in solidarity with them.  The other is to those who are encountering Fr. Sinnott in his work abroad.  Anything visited upon him is visited upon everyone in Ireland.  For this reason, the Parliament wants to send a message to people who may never get to hear it, namely, that we want him released and to have immediate access to the medical support he requires.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_182">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_834">I am grateful to my friend and colleague, Deputy Higgins, for seeking this Adjournment debate and affording me a brief opportunity to lend my support to the appeal that he has made before Parliament — I hope it will be echoed on the other side of the world — for the immediate release of Fr. Michael Sinnott, an elderly son of my home town of Wexford and the parish of Clonard which he visited not long ago to recuperate following heart bypass surgery.  During his visit he said mass in Clonard church.  He comes from a distinguished Wexford family that has given great public service to the community.  His abduction has caused considerable distress to his family in Wexford, his religious brothers, the wider community in Wexford and the entire nation.  I am heartened to hear of the immediate intervention to be made by our ambassador to Singapore who has flown to the Philippines.  I also know of the active involvement of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">It is a source of great distress that two Irish citizens have been abducted in two parts of the world — the Sudan and the Philippines.</p>

Every side of the House will join in exhorting the Department of Foreign Affairs to do all that it can to intervene speedily in this matter.  Genuinely, we fear that the health of Fr. Sinnott is not great.  He needs his medication and freedom.</p>

          <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_185">
            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe</from>
            <p eId="para_838">I thank Deputy Higgins for allowing me to add my voice to the call for the early release of Fr. Michael Sinnott.  As Deputy Howlin stated, he is a native of County Wexford and I know members of his family well.  One of his nieces is a member of my office staff in Enniscorthy and I know how concerned his family is for his safety and well-being.  He is 80 years of age and, as Deputy Higgins stated, has spent a long time, nearly 50 years, in the Philippines.  Like many Columban priests, he has done good work to ensure the well-being of people there.  I ask that his captors release him early or liaise with the Columban order or the authorities in the Philippines to ensure this situation can be brought to a satisfactory end.  As we all know, Fr. Sinnott had heart bypass surgery a number of years ago and is in need of medication.  His health is of significant concern to us all.  He has been described as a compassionate defender of victims, a fighter of injustices and a benefactor to the poor, particularly adults and children with disabilities.  I echo Bishop Denis Brennan's sentiments expressed on Monday morning when he asked Deputies and the greater community to remember in their prayers and thoughts Fr. Sinnott, better known as Fr. Mal, in order that the situation might be brought to a speedy and satisfactory end.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" eId="spk_186" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_839">Like the Deputies, I am extremely concerned for the welfare of Father Michael Sinnott, who was abducted from his residence near the southern city of Pagadian in the Philippines, on Sunday, 11 October.  Father Sinnott, who is a member of the Missionaries of St. Columba, is nearly 80 years of age.  He has a heart condition, which required a bypass four years ago and is in need of daily medication.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">I wish to assure the House that the Government is making every possible effort to secure Father Sinnott's release.  On hearing of his abduction, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, immediately asked our ambassador to the Philippines, Mr. Richard O'Brien, who is based in Singapore, to travel to the Philippines to impress upon the Government there our concerns about the safety and health of Father Sinnott and also to work with the authorities to help secure his early release.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">The information we have received is that Father Sinnott was abducted by a number of armed men from the Columban house in Gates District in Pagadian City. The Government authorities in the Philippines have reported to Ambassador O'Brien that the assailants forcibly entered the Columban house, seized Father Sinnott at gunpoint and fled with him in a mini-van which was subsequently abandoned and burned.  The abductors took Father Sinnott to a nearby beach where they boarded one or more boats.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">The Philippine security forces immediately launched an operation against the kidnappers.  The security forces claim to know the whereabouts of the kidnappers and to be monitoring their position.  The Philippine Government has issued a statement condemning the kidnapping of Father Sinnott, expressing its abhorrence at this type of crime and appealing for Father Sinnott's immediate and safe release.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">On his arrival in Manila, Ambassador O'Brien met the superior of the Columban order and other members of the Columban community, many of whom are Irish.  He has also met with the deputy secretary of the ministry of the interior; with the under secretary of state of the Philippine Government who is managing the kidnap and who had been given charge of the operation.  He also met with the deputy chief of police, who has special responsibility for the safe return of Father Sinnott and with the police chief of the neighbouring area, who is joint co-ordinator of the task force established to deal with the abduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">Ambassador O'Brien also met with officials from the ministry of foreign affairs and the British Embassy.  He has been working throughout with the invaluable assistance of our honorary consul in Manila, Ms. Noreen Trota.  The Philippine authorities gave the ambassador an account of their investigation and efforts to date to free Father Sinnott.  Ambassador O'Brien impressed upon them that the Philippine authorities have operational responsibility for the management of this hostage situation and for security matters in their own country, and for the resolution of this unacceptable situation in a swift and peaceful manner.  He also stressed that efforts are needed in the short term to persuade the kidnappers to ensure that Father Sinnott has all the necessary medication he needs at this time.  The local church has appealed to the kidnappers to secure the necessary medical supplies for Father Sinnott.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">The Philippine Government has also indicated that as yet nobody has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, and there has not been any contact from the kidnappers.  While a number of groups have been cited locally as possibly responsible for the kidnapping, it would be counter-productive to speculate further at this stage.  The Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, has been in direct contact with the head of the Columban order both here and in the Philippines.  The consular division of the Department of Foreign Affairs has been in contact with the family contact person here in Ireland.  Father Sinnott has four sisters, one of whom is a Loreto sister.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">In conclusion, I appeal to the kidnappers to release Father Sinnott.  He has made such a contribution to the welfare of the ordinary people of the Philippines and he deserves to be honoured for his work rather than taken by force from his home in such a violent manner.</p>

         if he will have discussions with EirGrid to promote the construction of a 7 km cable from Sorn station in County Donegal to Coolkeeragh station in County Derry, which would enable wind energy produced in the northwest of the Republic of Ireland to be sold on in the UK and European markets; his views on the potential for wind energy production on the peninsular north–west Atlantic coast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_187">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_848">The North West is particularly rich in renewable energy resources. Facing on to the Atlantic Ocean, the peninsula has probably the best wind energy and ocean energy potential anywhere in Europe.  Developing the electricity grid infrastructure in the North West, in an economically viable and environmentally acceptable way, is the key to harvesting these rich natural resources to the benefit of the region, the economy and consumers.  The North West certainly has the potential to become a net electricity exporter to the rest of the island and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">I fully support EirGrid's GRID25 strategy, which sets out in broad terms the development required in each region of the country out to 2025.  EirGrid concludes that the capacity of the backbone transmission system needs to be doubled in the period from now to 2025 in order to meet future levels of demand, security of supply needs and to deliver on our ambitions for renewable energy.  Upgrading the grid on the scale required will reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, support our climate change and renewable energy targets, contribute to energy efficiency, and ensure the right conditions for attracting industry in support of regional development.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">Grid25 states that the renewable energy demand in the North West region could grow by up to 60% by 2025.  EirGrid's assessment is that Donegal could have almost 700 MW of wind generation by 2025, with Mayo/Galway having around 890MW and Leitrim/Roscommon having just over 250 MW of wind.  This is in addition to the potential for 300 MW of ocean generating technologies where the challenge is to get to large scale deployment over the next decade.  I welcome EirGrid's clear recognition of the potential of the North West region to deliver over 2,000 MW of renewable electricity over the next 15 or so years.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">An ambitious but cost effective level of transmission infrastructure will be needed to deliver this renewable capacity, in a region which is acknowledged to have a relatively weak transmission system currently.  Grid25 has already identified the key infrastructure upgrades for the North West region:</p>
            <p eId="para_852">Investment of approximately €750m to upgrade almost 700 km of the existing transmission network in the North West and to build new circuits;</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Extension of the 220 kV network into Sligo, which is already in progress;</p>
            <p eId="para_854">110 kV reinforcements between Killybegs and Letterkenny, and between Ballaghadreen and Castlebar;</p>
            <p eId="para_855">Major infrastructural development from Mayo to the main bulk transmission system in the eastern part of the region;</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Further integration of the Donegal and Northern Ireland networks in conjunction with NIE, the Northern Ireland Transmission company.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">In that latter context EirGrid, in conjunction with SONI and Northern Ireland Electricity, is assessing the overall options for strengthening the linkages between the two networks.  The Sorne line referred to in the question is one of several possible options which the study is looking at.  The specific lines and routes ultimately identified, will be subject to the normal planning processes North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">In conclusion I fully endorse the need to unlock the potential of the North West to generate and export very significant amounts of renewable electricity and the key strategic role the region will play in delivering our national targets.  The benefits of enhanced cross border electricity grid connections are self evident for both systems.  This will be critical for both Northern Ireland and Ireland as we work respectively to deliver on the island's renewable energy potential and to support jobs and growth to the benefit of citizens North and South.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_860">I welcome the "Broadband Quality Score" report published jointly by the Universities of Oxford (England) and Oviedo (Spain) on October 1st last.  The report is the second annual global study on the quality of broadband connections which provides useful comparisons of quality and penetration indicators between the countries studied in each year and a measurement of progress achieved in the period between the two reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">The 2009 report highlights significant progress in Ireland's broadband performance across a range of headings. In particular it reflects the significant improvements in the roll out, penetration and quality of Ireland's broadband over the past year.  The report highlights the improved broadband quality of service in Ireland moving the State into the group of countries that are recognised as "Meeting the needs of today's applications".  In the previous report, published in 2008, Ireland was in the lower ranked group of countries that were classified as "Below today's applications threshold".</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Ireland's overall ranking of 16th out of the 66 countries in the Broadband Leadership table, measuring broadband quality  and penetration by households, is commendable and shows due recognition for our increased penetration and quality over recent years.  Ireland is also credited for its performance in terms of "Broadband Leadership Movers 2008–2009 Innovation Economies".  Only 11 of the 66 countries are credited as leaders in this "innovation economies" class.  Dublin is ranked at 87, from a Broadband Quality Score perspective, of more than 240 cities surveyed bringing it within the top 100 cities in the 66 countries surveyed and is classified as meeting the needs of today's applications.  It is my understanding that major enterprises already located in, or who wish to locate in Ireland can contract with service providers who can provide world class broadband speeds if required.  Our significant improvement in broadband availability over recent years is recognised in the table "penetration 2009" where we occupy 12th place in the table of 66 countries and were the 5th best country in terms of improvements in penetration between 2008 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">I fully recognise the need to further improve access and the speed of broadband available in Ireland.  I am determine to ensure that targeted Government action, the proper regulatory regime and a spirit of competitive collaboration within industry will address the issues.  The high level recommendations for policy makers contained in the plan referred to in the Deputy's question are already embedded in my recently published policy paper "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland".  It is also important to note that the report underpins recent OECD, ECTA and ComReg reports, which confirm improvements in Ireland's roll out and speed of broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_865">For any developed country, a postcode system is a key piece of national infrastructure that can deliver economic and social benefits across the whole economy.  Ireland is the only country in the EU that does not have such a code in place.  Consultations conducted by the National Postcode Project Board's advisors revealed an overwhelming support for the introduction of postcodes across public, private and voluntary sectors and identified that postcodes would not only deliver benefits for the postal sector but also would contribute to the development of a knowledge economy and the country's overall competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">With respect to the postal sector, the forthcoming liberalisation of the market in 2011 has highlighted the absence of a postcode as a potential barrier to market development and many stakeholders see postcodes as playing an important role in development of a competitive, high-quality postal sector.  However, some of the more significant benefits of having a postcode in place will materialise outside of the postal and logistics sectors.  These benefits include providing an enhanced capacity and capability to use spatial data effectively and link databases with spatial elements across Government.  Using spatial data more effectively can improve public policy making and help with the more effective use of resources.  Postcodes will also facilitate better location-based services and will also facilitate the speedier deployment of emergency services.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">The National Postcodes Project Board's report estimated upfront costs of establishing a postcode address database, implementing and promoting the postcode would be in the region of €15m.  Following on from the Government approval to implement postcodes, my officials and I are currently working to address the next steps in this project, including the process of selecting a body to implement the proposed system.  It is expected that postcodes will be assigned and in use in 2011 based on a competitive process which will be launched before the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_869">Applications for grid connections are made to ESB Networks and/or EirGrid, in the first instance and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is responsible for oversight of the grid connection process.  I have no statutory role in the Gate 3 process, which is established and actively under way.  The Government has set targets to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity consumed to 15% by 2010 and 40% by 2020.  Steady progress has been made towards the 2010 target and with over 1,300 MW of renewable capacity now in place, renewable generation constituted 12.2% of all electricity consumed last year, up from just 4.4% in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The CER and EirGrid have calculated that 5,800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity is required to achieve the 40% target in 2020.  The latest figures from EirGrid and the CER show that there are in excess of 1,300 MW of renewable electricity capacity already connected to the system with a further 1,500 MW with signed connection agreements or in the final stages of agreeing one from the Gate 2 process.  In December 2008 CER issued a decision on the ‘Gate 3' round, which provides for connection offers for approximately 4,000 MW of additional renewable electricity capacity.  The scale of the Gate 3 round was initially set at 3,000 MW of capacity by the CER but I am pleased to say that this was increased to around 4,000 MW of capacity to duly reflect the Government's increased renewable electricity 2020 target of 40%.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">The Gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER and all industry stakeholders were afforded the opportunity of responding to the proposed connection process.  The projects for Gate 3 were selected by reference to the date applications were completed.  In accordance with the principle of equity those projects longest in the queue have been dealt with first.  The projects are currently being assessed as part of the connection offer process and the CER has established an industry liaison group, which includes members from all the renewable industry associations.  The Group meets regularly and is kept up to date with all the relevant issues inherent in processing 4,000 MW of connection offers.  Bearing in mind that the total electricity system in Ireland is around 7,800 MW of generation capacity, it is clear to see the scale and complexity of the connection challenge.  The CER advises that connection offers are expected to start issuing around the end of this year and the process is expected to continue throughout 2010 and into early 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">The take up rate by developers in receipt of Gate 3 connection offers over the period will be a crucial determinant of the success of the process.  The CER have confirmed that additional projects would be incorporated into Gate 3 in the event that existing projects do not materialise.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.  Under this Act, RTÉ is required to provide a national ‘free to air' digital terrestrial television system with capacity to carry RTÉ 1, Network 2, TG4 and TV3.  This new service will eventually replace the existing analogue free to air television service.  The legislation also requires the newly established Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to provide for the development of commercial digital terrestrial television services.  A competition for commercial multiplexes was initiated by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) in 2008 and is still ongoing.  The contract has been offered to the One Vision consortium.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">The BAI has taken over the role of the BCI in finalising this competition.  The BAI, which is an independent regulatory authority, is responsible under the 2009 Act for the licensing and competition issues raised by the Deputy.  While I have no direct function in these matters, I am concerned on policy grounds to see an early agreement on the provision of commercial DTT services and an early time path for the implementation of such agreement.  My policy objective is the earliest possible switch-off of the analogue system thereby releasing valuable spectrum to enable Ireland to reap the benefits of the digital dividend.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">I am informed by RTÉ that 13 sites have been DTT enabled to accommodate both the single free to air DTT multiplex and also the three commercial DTT multiplexes.  This represents the most difficult and costly element of the build plan as it includes the main transmitter sites in Ireland.  It also involves costs associated with replacing several of these masts to accommodate the commercial multiplexes.  In relation to the timing of the rollout of the ‘free to air' DTT service, the legislation provides that RTÉ must provide a full national DTT service by the end of 2011 or such later date as the Minister decides.  RTÉ have not yet set a date for launching their DTT services but have indicated a preference for launching in parallel with a commercial DTT operator as the availability of commercial DTT is important to assist RTÉ in getting a return on their investment and to ensure adequate viewer choice in the digital era.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_878">There are currently in the region of 1,400 megawatts (MWS) of renewable generation plants connected to the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  Almost 100 individual windfarms have been connected with a combined capacity of around 1,100 MWs.  240 MWs of hydro-power are connected.  The balance represents biomass plants mainly landfill gas.  The contribution from renewable energy connected to the electricity grid is increasing steadily from year to year.  Renewable generation contributed 12.2% of all electricity consumed in 2008 compared to just 4.4% in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">The Government's target is to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity consumed to 15% by 2010 and at least 40% by 2020.  The national target fully reflects the EU renewable energy target set for Ireland under the Renewable Energy/Climate Change package.  Delivery of additional new projects to meet or possibly even surpass these targets is under way.  Currently, there is approximately a further 1400 MWs of capacity in additional projects, which have received connection offers and which have been accepted into the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) programme.  These projects were part of the Gate 1 and Gate 2 processes, and will typically be built and connected to the grid over the next two or three year period.  The projects being built this year and next year will ensure the 2010 target of 15%.  Those built in following years will contribute to our 2020 target.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and EirGrid have calculated that around 5,800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity will be required to deliver the 40% target in 2020.  The CER decision on the ‘Gate 3' round provides for connection offers for 4,000 MW of additional renewable electricity capacity.  Approximately 90% of these offers are wind powered capacity including around 800 MW of offshore wind.  The projects in Gate 3 were selected by the CER on a "first come first served" criterion.  The 4,000 MW of capacity within the Gate 3 process are currently being assessed as part of the connection process.  Connection offers are expected to issue between late 2009 and early 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">To ensure this process operates efficiently and to keep the industry stakeholders informed of the ongoing work, the CER has established a Gate 3 Liaison Group involving all stakeholders, including the renewable industry associations.  The objective is to ensure the connection offer process is completed quickly and as effectively as possible.  The Gate 3 process itself was extensively consulted on by the CER in the interests of transparency.  With a full public consultation and dedicated industry workshops, all industry stakeholders were afforded the opportunity of responding to the proposed connection process well in advance of the decision being made.  The decision by CER on Gate 3 is potentially capable of delivering the 40% national target for the contribution from renewable energy resources to electricity consumed by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">In the event of any fallout from the Gate 3 offers a further process would be proposed by the CER to add replacement projects to ensure delivery of the national renewable electricity target for 2020.  Further developments will also be influenced by grid technology developments, power flow management techniques, and progressive interconnection between Ireland, the UK and potentially Europe.</p>

            <p eId="para_886">As I have already stated in reply to an earlier question today, the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.

            <p eId="para_892">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 418 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">The Government's Home Energy Saving Scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retro-fitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.  It is clearly important to strike a balance between value for money in relation to the cost of the investment in delivering energy efficiency savings measures and the value of those energy savings to the economy.  SEI has therefore put in place a requirement that applicants to the Scheme install measures attracting a minimum grant payment of €500.  The minimum grant threshold serves to ensure value for money to the Exchequer, while encouraging homeowners to take a holistic approach from the outset to improving the energy efficiency of their homes.  The Scheme is proving to be extremely successful.   There are currently 23,000 approved applications in the system, representing in total a take-up of over 48,000 measures.  Roof and cavity wall insulation are proving the most popular.  This clearly shows that householders are availing of the combinations of measures to secure grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">In relation to the Deputy's concern about persons on low incomes, I would point out that the Warmer Homes Scheme is specifically targeted at low income households.   Some €20 million has been provided to the Warmer Homes Scheme for 2009.  This represents a very substantial increase on previous years.  This Scheme provides for the installation of a range of energy efficiency measures at little or no cost to the homeowner.  The measures include cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Details of this Scheme are available from Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  The Warmer Homes Scheme is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also set aside some €25 million for two initiatives designed to address thermal inefficiencies in local authority dwellings.  Of this, €20 million has already been allocated to local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of dwellings and apartment complexes, to a BER standard of C1.  €5 million has been set aside to support a number of demonstration projects that will achieve a BER rating in excess of C1 and will inform the future improvement of the overall local authority stock.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_897">The current EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which runs until the end of 2012, requires a free allocation of carbon credits to electricity generators.  The North/South Single Electricity Market Committee, which is statutorily responsible for the operation of the all-island electricity market on the island of Ireland, decided that from 2008 all electricity generators must include the full opportunity cost of their carbon allocations when bidding into the Single Electricity Market.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">The enterprise community in particular is concerned that this increases the wholesale cost of electricity and gives rise to windfall gains being earned by electricity generators.  The cost impact of carbon and the related windfall gains for generators fluctuates with the price of carbon which is currently at approximately €13 a tonne.  The Government decided last July to work to progress the introduction of legislation to recover carbon windfall gains from electricity generators up to 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">My Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, is currently examining the complex issues inherent in designing a legislative scheme, which could recover carbon windfall gains from electricity generators.  There are many considerations to take into account and a variety of potential implications inherent in any particular approach to the carbon windfall issue.  The potential impact on the rules and operation of the all-island Single Electricity Market, which straddles the two jurisdictions, North and South, must also be taken into account.  I will be reverting to the Government with the outcome of our analysis as soon as possible.  In this context the House should recall that ESB contributed over €300m this year to reduce electricity prices for all consumers, of which ESB's carbon benefits accounted for a significant portion.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">For the future and in the context of the European Union's ambitious plans for carbon emissions and cap and trade after 2012, my personal view is that the allocation of carbon credits, which is the basis for trading, should be done by auction rather than free allocation.  I strongly favour a scenario post 2012 in which all carbon permits should be bought on the open market and producers can compete on the basis of carbon costs.  This will eliminate any windfall gains for electricity producers and promote competition between generators as to who can produce electricity using the least carbon.  In my view this is an essential development, which will be good for the environment and good for the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 52 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The "All Island Grid Study" published early last year, examines the ability of the electricity systems on an All-Island basis to absorb power from renewable energy powered projects.  Without being prescriptive, its findings showed that penetration of up to 42% renewable electricity is technically feasible without any major increase in pumped storage.  There are however, a number of different perspectives on the potential role for pumped storage in an electricity system with very significant levels of renewable energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">It is the case that several private parties, including the Spirit of Ireland group specifically referred to by the Deputy, are actively developing renewable energy proposals which are predicated on pumped storage projects.  The promoters of the Spirit of Ireland project presented their proposal last May, during a series of meetings with my Department, with other Departments as well as with the ESB, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I also met the Spirit of Ireland group myself.  These early initial meetings gave my Department and me a good preliminary insight into this highly ambitious and complex proposal.  The promoters themselves acknowledged at that stage that there were very many elements to the project which needed detailed evaluation and analysis.  They signalled that they would revert in the autumn to me and my Department with the results of this work.  We look forward to further engagement with the promoters.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Pumped storage is one of a number of technical options for energy storage and SEI is contributing funding to a battery electric storage project at Sorne Hill in County Donegal.  While this particular research project is small scale and at a very early stage in terms of the commercial feasibility of the technology, I welcome the emergence of research, demonstration and deployment projects in this field.  Other options for storage which are being researched include compressed air storage systems which use excess electricity to compress air into a cavern or similar structure which can subsequently generate electricity through a turbine as it is released.  Any successful deployment of economically viable and environmentally acceptable storage technologies would enhance the ability of the electricity grid to accept higher penetration levels of intermittent renewable generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_908">The Bioenergy Market Assessment Report by Biopower is a useful contribution to thinking in relation to future directions for bio-energy.  It sets out the case for the development of Ireland's indigenous renewable energy resources, particularly highlighting the potential benefits for the agricultural sector, and for levels of employment and enterprise in rural areas.  The Report makes a number of recommendations which are being examined by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The Government is committed to the sustainable development of the national bioenergy resource which will, in particular, be crucial to meeting the considerable challenge of delivering on the national targets for renewable heat.  Funding is provided to support renewable heating in both domestic and industrial buildings, under the Greener Homes and Reheat Programmes.  These have already leveraged significant amounts of investment into the market for renewable heat, which is also underpinning job creation in both the supply and services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">In terms of the penetration of bioenergy in the Transport sector, the Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes have seen the use of biofuels in Ireland grow from practically zero to just under 2% in 2008, and helped develop and support a number of indigenous companies producing biofuels.  These companies will be in a position to benefit from the introduction of the National Biofuels Obligation from next year.  Investment in the biofuels sector is critical if consumers are to be able to take advantage of the environmental benefits associated with biofuels at least cost, and in order to support research into second generation biofuels feed stocks that do not compete with food crops.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">To enhance the good progress to date in developing the renewable electricity sector we need to increase the use of locally based distributed generation.  A support tariff of 19 cent per kwh for the first 4,000 installations was introduced earlier this year by ESB Customer Supply specifically for microgeneration and is being supplemented by the microgeneration technology programme within Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  The projects that are being supported have been selected, and installation and monitoring of the equipment is under way.  Overseen by the Renewable Energy Development Group, which includes the relevant Departments, State Agencies and industry representatives, as well as other stakeholders, my Department is coordinating the development of a Biomass Energy Road Map, which will inform the development of indigenous renewable resources across the electricity, heat and transport sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_915">I propose to take Questions Nos 12, 27 and 55 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">Electric vehicles offer an increasingly realistic solution in terms of reducing the transport sector's Greenhouse Gas Emissions while at the same time tackling Ireland's dependence on imported fossil fuels.  There is very significant global investment under way in research and development in this area.  The technology is now maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  The range of new car models by virtually all motor manufacturers recently revealed at the recent Frankfurt motor show makes this very clear.  The challenge now is to develop economically viable options for the establishment, cost efficient operation and maintenance of an electric vehicle infrastructure network in Ireland, together with measures to develop a market for the vehicles themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">The Minister for Transport and I recently announced plans for the large scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, will equate to around 225,000 cars on Irish roads.  An Inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Taskforce on electric vehicles is chaired by my Department and comprises the Departments of Transport, Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is also joining the Task Force in light of its statutory responsibilities for the regulated networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">The Taskforce will advise on the options and timeframes for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the national roll-out of electric vehicles in a cost effective manner.  Initial estimates for the roll out of infrastructure are between 6 and 18 months depending on the scale of initial deployment.  Global developments will be factored in as the technologies mature.  The Taskforce will very shortly report its initial findings and advise on next steps.  The report will also advise on overall costs and financial implications.  It is my intention in the context of Budget 2010 to discuss with the Minister for Finance, the introduction of necessary financial incentives to assist in the roll out of electric vehicles.  Obviously I cannot be specific in this regard, in advance of the Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">The Memorandum of Understanding concluded by the ESB and my Department with Renault-Nissan is designed to increase the level of knowledge available on the infrastructure requirements of electric vehicles and ensure that Ireland has the opportunity to be one of the first countries to be supplied with both Renault and Nissan electric cars.  This represents a major opportunity for Ireland.  Under the Memorandum of Understanding ESB Networks will be able to avail of data on developments in electric vehicles which will inform our consideration of optimum infrastructure, support mechanisms and the potential benefits accruing.  The Memorandum of Understanding does not convey any exclusive rights in relation to the provision of electric cars.  Ireland is open for business to all manufacturers in relation to electric vehicles and I am open to building relationships with all global players in the sector.  My Department and the ESB are currently in discussions with other motor manufacturers, with a view to developing potential additional Memoranda of Understanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">I have read with interest the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change on electric vehicles and I am grateful to members of the Committee for their valuable contribution.  The recommendations in the report are being considered in the context of our work to implement an overall strategy for electric vehicles. Much of the report resonates with the Government's own strategic initiatives to ensure that Ireland is one of the early movers in the electrification of transport.</p>

        [35572/09]

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_199">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_922">Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is a highly efficient way of generating on-site heat and electricity simultaneously. It can offer significantly reduced energy bills for the end user and is a particularly efficient form of energy generation as it minimises any transmission losses involved in getting power to the site.  Traditionally, CHP plants were only used in large industrial units with a high on-site heat load.  Increasingly the technology is developing higher efficiency, smaller scale units that are capable of servicing smaller buildings and even down to individual residential scale units.  As this technology becomes more common in the market, smaller commercial premises, including public buildings, can now reduce their energy costs by installing CHP systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">My Department, through Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), has run a Deployment Programme for CHP technologies for several years.  The programme was expanded in early 2008 to include dedicated support for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion powered CHP.  Under the SEI Support Programme a significant number of Public Buildings have taken advantage of the benefits of CHP, or are currently in the process of doing so.  For example, three separate academic institutions have installed CHP systems, with a total electrical capacity of 850 kilowatts, and two more are in the process of installing systems with an electrical capacity of 750 kilowatts.  In the Health sector, 5 hospitals have already installed CHP systems with a total electrical capacity of 770 kilowatts, and 3 local authorities sites have installed systems with an electrical capacity of 350 kilowatts, with one more in construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">Moreover, the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat), which incentivises the installation of biomass boilers, is also open to institutional users of heat, and has already supported the construction of a number of projects where the heat load was not sufficient to justify the expense of a CHP plant.  Taken together, CHP technologies and the projects supported by Reheat offer a real and immediate solution to energy costs in these types of institutions by reducing the cost of power and increasing the overall energy efficiency of the buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">There are particular challenges for Ireland in achieving significant CHP penetration given our dispersed low density population and the characteristics of the built environment.  The improvements in CHP technology and the ongoing work of SEI with the Public Sector and industry will help us to overcome the challenges.</p>

            <p eId="para_927">My Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in December 2008.  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and who seek a service.  The NBS is being rolled out on an electoral division (ED) basis with a total of 1,028 EDs to receive broadband services under the NBS. 3 is progressing its network rollout and to date, NBS services have been made available in 32% of the EDs (329).</p>
            <p eId="para_928">Under the NBS contract, 48% of the EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to be enabled by the end of December 2009, while all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area must be covered by the end of September 2010.  My Department is intensively monitoring delivery of the NBS to ensure that all contractual commitments are fully met.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 32 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">The establishment of a one-stop-shop is one of the key commitments contained in the Next Generation Broadband policy paper "Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", which I published in June this year.  The objective of a one-stop-shop is to enable access on a satisfactory and an open basis to broadband ducting assets in State ownership.  It is my intention to see this initiative is operational as soon as possible thereby improving the State's overall broadband infrastructure.  My officials have consulted with the relevant State agencies in the energy and transport sectors to establish what infrastructure is available that could be included in a one-stop-shop.  Implementation of a one-stop-shop involves consideration of complex commercial, technical and legal issues to ensure that the public good is protected in tandem with achievement of the overall objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">I will shortly establish an Implementation Task Force chaired by my Department and comprising senior officials from the relevant State agencies who own ducting infrastructure to oversee the project.  Separately, I also intend to ask Government to oblige all State companies which own ducting infrastructure to provide service providers with open access in the future.  Meanwhile I propose to amend Part 5 of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 relating to carrying out communications work on public roads.  These proposed amendments will, provide a framework for the National Roads Authority to make ducts on national roads and motorways accessible to telecommunication companies.  It is intended that these amendments will be introduced in the Committee Stage of the Premium Rate Services Bill 2009 which is scheduled for next month.</p>

            <p eId="para_937">EirGrid is developing the East West Interconnector to schedule.  The Government is fully committed to the cost effective delivery of the interconnector as a key strategic energy infrastructure project.  The East West Electricity Interconnector is one of a list of high profile and strategically important interconnector projects included in the European Energy Programme for Recovery earlier this year with a grant of €110 million.  This represents a strong confirmation of EU support for the East West Interconnector, which is designated a Project of European Interest and has already attracted some €3 million grant aid for the study phase under the EU Trans European Networks programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">On 28th September last, the European Investment Bank announced that it is also supporting the project through the provision of a €300 million loan.  This significant financial support will further facilitate the cost effective development of this strategic energy project to the benefit of Irish energy consumers and our overall energy infrastructure.  The priority attached to this project by both the Government and the EU reflects the significant benefits which the East West Interconnector will deliver.  The interconnector will underpin regional energy market development and the all-island Single Electricity Market.  It will ensure that Ireland can benefit from and contribute to the development of a robust internal energy market in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">East West interconnection will also give Ireland direct and secure access to the UK energy market and onwards also to the EU mainland markets.  This will increase Ireland's security of electricity supply and enhance the competitive energy market.  Over time the interconnector should exert downward pressure on prices in the all-island electricity market.  The Government has set the ambitious target of 40% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  The East West Interconnector will support the increased penetration of renewable generation, particularly wind generation in the Irish market.  It will, in particular, offer opportunities for export of Irish wind generated electricity.</p>

            <p eId="para_941">The Digital Hub Development Agency has enjoyed much success in creating a cluster of young and vibrant enterprises in the Digital Hub focusing on the creation and development of digital media content. There are now 870 employees working in 101 companies located in the Digital Hub.  A further 290 approximately contract employees are engaged on a regular basis by Hub companies.  Approximately one in six digital media companies currently operating in Ireland is based in the Digital Hub.  The work of these companies encompasses computer gaming, animation, online bookings, Internet security, website development, mobile technologies, broadcasting, design and Internet services.

            <p eId="para_944">The Government is committed to ensuring that the public sector leads the way on energy efficiency with a mandatory programme of efficiency measures, including the sole use of energy efficient lighting and heating in offices, schools hospitals and other public buildings to produce 33% energy savings by 2020.  I published the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in May of this year setting out the actions being taken by Government to achieve 20% energy efficiency savings right across the economy by 2020, including the more ambitious target of 33% for the public sector.  Given the challenge presented by the national target and more importantly, the opportunities for considerable savings in energy costs and emissions reductions, it is right that the public sector should fulfil an exemplar role.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">As part of the mechanisms for delivery of the National Action Plan, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has been tasked with coordinating public sector actions and with monitoring and recording the energy and CO2 savings achieved.  The energy efficiency savings potential will, of course, vary from one public sector body to another.  Every public sector body will be expected to contribute significantly to meeting the Government's overall global target of33%.  This requires a galvanising of all players across the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The National Action Plan sets out the range of energy efficiency policies and measures already in place or planned right across the public sector.  I am taking this opportunity to outline some of the key initiatives which I asked my own Department to take forward this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Regulations are being finalised in my Department that will include new energy efficient public procurement rules and these will be in place in the coming months.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEI's database of highly energy efficient products.  This database was developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme for energy efficient technologies.  It covers 29 different classes of technology, including lighting, boilers and information technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">SEI is also tasked in these regulations with producing general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the new OPW National Public Procurement Office.  I have provided some €6 million to SEI in 2009 for two new energy efficiency programmes for the public sector.  €1 million of these funds is available for a new Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme and €5 million for a new Scheme of Supports for Exemplar Energy Efficiency Projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">The Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme is designed as the main delivery mechanism for coordinating and encouraging energy efficiency actions by other public sector bodies.  It is providing free energy assessments of up to 400 public buildings in 2009.  It is providing professional advice on energy management and energy efficiency improvement measures and aims to train 150 public sector building managers this year.  SEI is also developing best practice guidance materials and facilitating specialist workshops on matters such as public street lighting, water services, and ICT.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">The new Scheme of Supports for Exemplar Energy Efficiency Projects provides grants to public bodies for specific retrofit energy efficiency projects.  A similar parallel programme of the same name is available to the private sector.  To be eligible for support, projects have had to demonstrate that they are innovative, lead to significant energy savings and have high value in terms of the showcasing of savings opportunities to the wider public sector.  The scheme closed at the end of September and attracted some 49 applications from right across the public sector, including schools, Government offices, local authorities and hospitals.  For the Exchequer's investment of €5 million in this Scheme, SEI estimates that the supported projects will deliver annual energy savings of €2.5 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_952">As Minister with overall responsibility for spectrum policy, I am committed to ensuring that the spectrum resource is assigned and used effectively.  This involves the efficient use of spectrum and also involves ensuring that spectrum policy is sufficiently flexible to accommodate technological development and that it supports and promotes innovation, and research and development, in new spectrum based technologies.  A radio spectrum policy to meet emerging needs must make sure that the radio spectrum serves not only economic interests but also a range of public interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">The Commission for Communications Regulations (ComReg) has responsibility for the day to day management of the spectrum.  Spectrum is assigned by ComReg, by means of licences issued to individual licensees or licence exemptions, in accordance with Regulations, under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, approved by the Minister.  In carrying out these functions ComReg regularly publishes consultations regarding the approach they propose to use in relation to spectrum assignment including, most recently, the 2300 — 2400 MHz (2.3GHz) band.  Details of these consultations are available at www.comreg.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_955">In February 2009 I launched the Micro Generation programme, which is being operated by ESB Customer Supply and supported by ESB Networks.  The programme is aimed at encouraging up to 4,000 domestic customers to become involved in micro-scale projects within the next three years.  It will also enable two-way metering, to be installed without additional charge to the customer.  The domestic electricity producer will be paid a price of 19 cent per kilowatt-hour for any electricity exported to the grid, which will help to defray the initial start up costs.  The micro technologies in question include wind, hydro and domestic scale combined heat and power.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">Micro-scale electricity generation will benefit the participating customers up-front by offsetting their purchase of electricity from their electricity suppliers.  The additional incentive of a guaranteed price for electricity exported back to the grid is a significant encouragement to invest.  This competitive feed-in tariff will apply to the first 4,000 micro-generation installations countrywide over the next 3 years.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has also launched a Micro-generation Pilot Programme, involving research and technology monitoring programmes, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis, of micro-scale projects.  The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">I welcome the "Broadband Quality Score" report published jointly by the Universities of Oxford (England) and Oviedo (Spain).  The report reflects the significant improvements in the roll out, uptake and quality of Ireland's broadband over the past year.  The following points highlighted by the report are worthy of particular mention.  The report highlights Ireland's improved broadband position and found that in 2009 Ireland moved into the group of countries that are recognised as "Meeting the needs of today's applications".  During 2008 Ireland was in the group of countries that were classified as "Below today's applications threshold".</p>
            <p eId="para_959">Ireland's overall ranking of 16th out of the 66 countries in the Broadband Leadership shows due recognition for our increased penetration and quality over recent years.  Ireland is also credited for its performance in terms of "Broadband Leadership Movers 2008–2009 Innovation Economies".  Only 11 of the 66 countries are credited as leaders in this "innovation economies" class.  Dublin is ranked at 87 (from a Broadband Quality Score perspective) of more than 240 cities surveyed and is included in the top 100 cities in the 66 countries surveyed.  Inclusion in the top 100 cities of the global survey is praiseworthy.  Our significant improvement in broadband availability over recent years is recognised in the table "penetration 2009" where we occupy 12th place in the table of 66 countries and were the 5th best country in terms of improvements between 2008 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">The need to improve the speed of uploading and downloading is recognised and government policy, along with regulatory practice, and the current spirit of competitive collaboration from industry is facilitating the industry to address these issues.  The high level recommendations for policy makers contained in the report are already embedded in my recently published policy paper "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland".  It is also important to note that the report underpins recent OECD, ECTA and ComReg reports, which confirm improvements in Ireland's roll out and speed of broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">There are currently approximately 1,400 megawatts (MWS) of renewable powered electricity generating plants accessing the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  There are almost 100 windfarms connected with a combined capacity of around 1,100 MWs, compared to hydro-power with 240 MWs connected and the balance made up of biomass, mainly landfill gas.  Based on current technology trends, the dominance in the renewable sector of the wind-powered category is expected to continue out to 2020 at least.  The amount of renewable-powered plant connected and accessing the electricity grid is increasing steadily from year to year. Last year 12.2% of all electricity consumed came from renewable resources compared to just 4.4% in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">Under EU Directive 2001/77/EC, Ireland has a target of 13.2% for renewable electricity to be achieved by 2010.  Ireland is on track to exceed this target and will meet the higher national target of 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010.  Under the recently agreed Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland's target is for 16% of all energy (to include electricity, heating and transport) to be from renewable sources by 2020.  The Government's target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 is commensurate with Ireland's EU target.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">In December 2008, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) issued a decision which requires EirGrid and ESB Networks to provide connection offers for an additional 3,900 MWs of new renewable capacity to ensure the 2020 target can be achieved.  This additional level of capacity, taken together with the capacity already built and the capacity that already has connection offers, is capable of meeting our 40% 2020 electricity target which EirGrid and the CER equate to an overall capacity of 5,800 MW of renewable capacity.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_972">The rollout of the national Smart Metering Programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the 2007 Programme for Government.  The Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand and to deliver greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.  Smart Metering is also increasingly emerging at European Union level as a critical dimension of enhancing energy efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">This is a highly complex project which covers both electricity and gas.  The pilot phase of the programme, which encompasses two strands, technology and customer behaviour, is now underway.  Technology trials will test a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  Customer behaviour trials are determining the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.  The trials are essential to ensure that the optimum and most cost effective technology and systems are identified for the implementation phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The electricity element of the pilot phase is expected to be completed at the end of December 2010.  It is important to have a trial that captures seasonal changes in usage for peak demand management purposes.  The outcome should be a fully informed decision on the most suitable model of smart meter/IT system, tariffing structure, communications system and demand stimuli.  The model must have the proven capability to deliver the anticipated benefits of smart metering, taking account of the specifics of the Irish energy system.  The electricity technology trial will examine metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  Installation of up to 8,000 meters has commenced for technology testing in Limerick/Ennis, Cork City/Bandon and South Dublin/Wicklow.  Over 6,000 participants for the electricity customer behaviour trial have been selected to ensure that the sample is representative of Ireland's electricity consumers both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  Installation of 6,363 meters for this trial has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The specifications of these metering systems will allow the testing of a range of functions to deliver enhanced demand management.  These include interval metering reading, time of use tariffing and the use of In Home Display devices.  They will also provide reliable quality data on actual energy use which will lead to significantly better services to consumers in areas such as, improved fault monitoring and outage recording, power quality monitoring, reduced theft and losses and improved network planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">The gas element of the pilot phase is also moving ahead.  Installation of over 1,900 meters for the Customer Behaviour Trial is on schedule for completion by end November.  A further 750 meters will be installed to facilitate the Gas Technology Trials.  The period for the customer behaviour and technology gas trials will begin in June 2010 and will continue until May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">The smart metering pilot is proceeding in parallel with the current microgeneration initiative and there are important links between the two.  The data gathered from the interval meters being used in the microgeneration scheme will provide vital information on the import and export of electricity, which will feed into the analysis of electricity use being carried out in the electricity element of the smart metering pilot.  In turn, the findings of the smart metering pilot will also inform the development of a long term microgeneration strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The present estimated cost of the pilot is €34.9m.  This comprises €29.9m for the electricity element and €5m for the gas element.  The cost of a national roll out will be determined on foot of the results of the pilot programme and decisions taken on the optimum type of cost effective smart metering system that will deliver the level of functionality required in an Irish market.  A key component of the pilot phase is the associated cost benefit analysis, which will critically inform future decisions.  An interim analysis will be completed next year with the final analysis, to include the results of the gas trials, to be completed by mid 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The Government recently approved the implementation of a postcode system as recommended by the National Postcode Project Board (NPPB).  My officials and I are currently working to address the next steps in this project, including the process of retention of a body to implement the proposed system.  It is expected that postcodes, which are in operation in almost all European countries, will be assigned and in use in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">A report by the NPPB, which is a board comprised of representatives from Government Departments, together with public and private sector organisations including the Communications Workers Union, identified many postal and non postal benefits of introducing postcodes and recommended that a postcode be introduced.  The report estimated that the upfront cost of establishing a postcode address database, implementing and promoting the postcode would be in the region of €15m.  The ongoing annual maintenance costs will be self-financing in that they would be met from revenues generated by the postcode manager charging for value added products and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">As a key piece of national infrastructure, a postcode system can deliver economic and social benefits and assist with the future development of the postal sector, which will benefit consumers and postal operators.  It will also greatly assist the development of the digital economy by enabling the trading of goods and services over the Internet.  It will also assist with the efficient, effective and innovative delivery of certain public services and will also unlock the potential across Government Departments for use of spatial data for policy planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">Whilst many of the benefits of postcodes cannot be accurately gauged in monetary terms, consultants asked to review the public sector benefits estimated the monetary benefits to the State would be €22 million in the medium term.  This analysis incurred fees of €54,450.  Separately, the NPPB was assisted in its work by technical and economic consultants, recruited and funded in 2005 by ComReg, at a cost of approximately €479,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">The two regulators, North and South, have been working together since late 2007 to develop joint proposals for the Common Arrangements for Gas (CAG) whereby all players in the gas market could buy, sell, transport and contribute to the development and planning of the natural gas market North and South on an all-island basis.  The work of the Regulators has included a Cost Benefit Analysis of the potential mutual economic and strategic benefits that the project could bring.  The analysis has shown quantifiable and strategic benefits for the two jurisdictions.  Following further independent review of that analysis undertaken on behalf of both Departments North and South, I am supportive of the project which I believe has the potential to achieve the strategic benefits identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The two regulators are working closely with my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland (DETI) on the project.  They are also continuing to engage with industry on the development of the high level design for CAG.  Work to date has focused on the key areas of system operations, transmission tariffs and gas quality which are the foundation stones on which the project can be built.  The Regulators have also commenced work on security of supply and the retail market.  To date, a number of consultation documents have been published and industry workshops held.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">In tandem with the work on this project, the EU Third Energy Package aimed at further reform of the European gas and electricity sector includes new rules for the promotion of regional and bilateral solidarity between transmission system operators and regulators leading to the establishment of regional gas markets.  These are objectives which dovetail with the CAG project.  Further work on CAG proposals will be fully informed by the EU internal gas market reforms including the structural arrangements for joint operation of the gas networks.  With a view to working towards conclusions at an early date on the high level design of the CAG while also achieving compliance with EU legislation I will, over the coming months, be considering the advice from my Department on optimum structural arrangements for the CAG and discussing the matter further with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">Implementation of the project would require arrangements to be underpinned by enabling legislation in both jurisdictions as was the case for the Single Electricity Market.  In light of work by the Regulators to date and the completion of further analysis by both Departments, I am hopeful that Minister Foster and myself can reach agreement in the coming months on the way forward and agree a clear timetable for the gas industry for progressive delivery of the CAG.</p>

            <p eId="para_992">EirGrid's Grid25 Strategy for developing the electricity transmission grid, has identified 2,000km of the existing system that requires upgrading to provide enhanced capacity, as well as 1,000km of new lines.  Upgrading of existing transmission lines as an alternative to building new lines is an effective way of increasing the transmission system capacity, and is an intrinsic part of EirGrid's approach, where feasible.  EirGrid has progressively upgraded existing lines over recent years, using new technologies as they emerge.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">EirGrid closely monitors new network technologies emerging globally, and tests the appropriateness of new technologies as they become available.  EirGrid has recently completed a conductor survey which has broadened the possible options for development of power lines through delivering improved capacity for new and existing power lines.  While new conductors will not be the answer in all cases, they can represent a more efficient and effective way to upgrade existing transmission lines than traditional techniques.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">Upgrading of existing lines as an option does not always meet system requirements.  There are of course, cases where new power lines are required to meet demand and ensure security of electricity supply regionally and nationally.  The North South Interconnector, which involves the construction of a new line, is vital for future security of supply North and South and EirGrid advises that deployment of new technologies on existing transmission lines elsewhere would be adequate to address the requirements which the North South project is designed to address.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_996">I welcome the fact that the benefits of competition in electricity supply, which have previously been confined to large industrial and commercial customers, are finally available to domestic consumers.  The entry into the domestic electricity market of two new suppliers, Airtricity and Bord Gáis Energy earlier this year, demonstrates that policy to encourage competition in electricity generation and supply is paying dividends for consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">The independent suppliers are offering discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB unit rates.  These discounts apply even after the 10% reduction in ESB prices implemented by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) from May 1st 2009.  The independent suppliers are also offering domestic consumers more choice including options in relation to the proportion of renewable electricity they purchase, as well as alternative billing arrangements.  Domestic customers have been switching to the independent suppliers in significant numbers.  However, there are close to 2 million domestic electricity customers and ESB still retains some 85% of the market share.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The CER has confirmed to me that the regulation of ESB tariffs will only continue until a sufficient level of competition has developed in the market.  Energy price regulation is designed to ensure that a dominant player cannot potentially engage in uncompetitive, short-term pricing practices, which could undermine or drive out emerging competition.  Progressive reduction of ESB's share of the electricity supply market is therefore critical to the timing for deregulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The CER, which has statutory responsibility for energy tariffs, will continue to review overall energy tariff structures taking account of global fuel prices, the importance of regulatory and market certainty for the energy sector, the competitiveness challenges facing industry and the needs of consumers generally.  In a tariff decision paper published on September 3rd 2009, the CER set out its commitment to the short to medium term removal of all price regulation, provided there is the continued development of the appropriate levels of sustainable competition in all sectors of the market.  The CER is to publish for public consultation a ‘Roadmap' for deregulation in the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1003">I propose to take Questions Nos. 33,  42 and 49 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The Fuel Poverty Action Research Project was established by Combat Poverty and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  The project involved an integrated and systematic ex-post assessment of the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the SEI-administered Warmer Homes Scheme which retrofits low income private homes with insulation and other energy saving measures.  The report was initially scheduled to be completed in 2008.  However, I am advised that its completion was delayed due to the accidental loss of some key data.  In August of this year the draft report was circulated to members of the research community for comment.  Following this consultation process, publication of the final report is expected before the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">The most recent research figures available on the numbers at risk of fuel poverty are contained in the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan which was published in May this year and which updates the Economic and Social Research Institute's (ESRI) working paper entitled, Fuel Poverty in Ireland: Extent, Affected Groups and Policy Issues, which was published in November 2008.  There are three methods of calculating the extent of fuel poverty: the expenditure method or share of income spent on household fuels; subjective measures on the part of occupants; and objective measurement of residence condition and comfort levels in relation to needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">ESRI estimates that using the expenditure method, 301,368 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty in 2008.  Alternatively, using the subjective method 68,050 or 4.6% of households reported that they could not afford to heat their homes adequately in 2006.  Enhancing the energy efficiency of homes through structural improvements is pivotal to the Government's strategy to address energy affordability.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in nearly 31,000 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme and ESB's associated Home Insulation Scheme which operates according to the Warmer Home Scheme specification.  Some €20 million has been provided for the scheme in 2009, which includes €5 million provided by ESB and BGE.  The additional funding will enable structural improvements to be made to at least 15,000 homes by the end of this year.  This represents a very significant up-scaling of the scheme underlining the Government's commitment to the problems of energy affordability.</p>

            <p eId="para_1032">The Warmer Homes Scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty and is delivered by community based organisations (CBOs).  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and St. Vincent De Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  The system of operation, application and delivery of the Warmer Homes Scheme is through local community based organisations (CBOs), of which 22 have, to date, been approved to provide this service.  Through this devolved model, each CBO is responsible for managing applications in their own operational areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">The waiting time for approval and participation in the scheme varies across CBOs depending upon the demand in their area of coverage and the resources available to them.  The average waiting time for receipt of the Scheme currently ranges between six and ten months, which is a significant improvement on previous years and represents huge progress towards a sustainable nationwide network of CBOs.  It is likely that some applicants who have applied for the scheme in the latter part of 2009 will not have it delivered to their homes in 2009.  SEI will continue to address these homes in 2010 subject to available funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of institutional supports and investment in improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock and the availability of advice.  The Keep Well and Warm booklet will continue to be regularly updated and revised.  This booklet, along with the associated website, provides energy saving advice and information on the availability of grant schemes to vulnerable households.  Some 132,000 copies of the revised booklet have been distributed in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_1039">The National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will be implemented by the end of 2010, will ensure broadband is available to almost all parts of the country.  In designing the NBS, which was approved by the EU Commission, it was necessary to strike a balance between reaching as many unserved areas as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas, thereby minimising market distortion in accordance with EU State Aid rules.  Accordingly, a small number of premises in areas not covered by the NBS will still not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical difficulties and other reasons (distance from nearest DSL enabled telephone exchange, no line of sight etc).</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">The widespread acceptance of the benefits of broadband has motivated the EU Commission to set aside a portion of European Economic Recovery Package (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently examining options around the design of a scheme using this funding to make a service available to such premises in rural areas.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in 2010 and conclude it by 2011.  A critical first step is to apply for and secure State Aid clearance from the European Commission.  This dialogue has already begun.</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">Ocean energy technologies are still in the research and development phase globally.  It is estimated that there are no more than 10 megawatts (MWs) of ocean energy test projects installed for testing internationally at this time.  This reflects the early phase of development of the technology within international research programmes.  The Government's target, following suitable technology development, is that 500 MWs of ocean energy would be delivered by a variety of projects to be developed by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has recently put in place a complementary process to the existing group processing approach to facilitate a variety of smaller scale renewable energy technologies gaining access to the grid.  The procedure is outlined in CER decision paper 09/099.  Under this new procedure a number of technologies including ocean and wave technologies that fulfil public interest criteria can obtain a grid connection to a maximum of 5 MW outside the existing gate process.  This should ensure speedier access to the grid for the development phase of ocean energy projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">In order to facilitate and progress ocean energy in Ireland, the dedicated Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) within Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), in partnership with the Marine Institute and ESBI, has undertaken a detailed assessment process since 2007 to identify the most suitable wave energy test site with a grid connection to the electricity network.  Following this process, the SEI is now developing a grid connected site off Annagh Point, County Mayo.  This facility will provide for the testing of operational pre-commercial wave energy devices directly connected to the electricity network.  A foreshore exploratory licence has recently been obtained to allow for site investigation work, which is currently under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">I am working closely with my colleagues the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that both the short term and medium term offshore energy licensing and planning issues are satisfactorily addressed and that a best practice offshore renewable energy planning regime is put in place to underpin sustainable development of the resource.  It is expected that approximately €6 million will be spent under the ocean energy programme this year.  This is made up of grant aid under the Prototype Development Fund of €4.3millon which this year will assist 10 Irish companies developing ocean and tidal energy devices; the Annagh Head test site and maintenance and improvements to the existing (non grid connected) Galway Bay test site; the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the strategic environmental assessment of Irish waters for ocean energy offshore wind development, which is under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1056">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has operated a group approach to connecting projects to the national grid, which is designed to streamline the connection process in the interests of efficiency and cost effectiveness for developers.  The current group approach, Gate 3, was the subject of extensive public consultation by the CER prior to its final decision in December 2008.

            <p eId="para_1057">The question of developing projects beyond the gate 3 process will depend on the level of take up by developers of the capacity in that process and on the ability of the grid to safely and securely accommodate steadily increasing amounts of intermittent power generation.  This will be influenced by the roll-out of EirGrid's GRID25 programme, the level of interconnection that develops with the UK and potentially to mainland Europe, and on the rate that technology improvements impact on both the grid and on wind turbines.  Applications for grid connections are made to ESB Networks or to EirGrid depending on size.  Supervision of the grid connection process and settlement of any disputes arising is vested in the CER.

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_224">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1059">The Government recognises that the cost of energy in Ireland is a serious competitiveness issue facing the enterprise sector during this difficult period for the economy. The provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies is critical for the economy. Ireland's high energy costs, by comparison with much of Europe, are primarily due to significant dependence on volatile imported fossil fuels, particularly gas, as well as a requirement for very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  The under-investment in networks and power generation posed real risks to security of supply which had become a major concern for enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">Recognising the concerns of indigenous business and the inward investment community, the Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.  All electricity users benefited in 2009 from direct subsidies totalling €567m.  These were made up of an ESB rebate to consumers of €315m, a repayment of certain Public Service Obligation (PSO) levies of €87m and the deferral of some network revenues until after October 2009.  In July the Government agreed that these subsidies will continue for large energy users at their current level until October 2010 and will then be phased out over the following two year period.  In some cases this will see businesses paying up to 40% less for electricity compared with what they were paying in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">In addition, arising from their review earlier this year of prices, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) lowered electricity prices for all customers by 10% and gas tariffs by an average of 12% for domestic and SME gas customers from May 1st 2009.  The CER's most recent pricing decision approved an average decrease in gas tariffs of 9.8% with effect from 1 October 2009.  The decrease was made possible by the downward shift in recent months in wholesale gas prices.  Small to Medium businesses will also see further reductions in their electricity bills of 5.5% from this month as the new CER tariff decisions come into effect and deliver further benefits to business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">The CER has also recently announced that the PSO Levy will be zero for 2009/2010.  The PSO is the mechanism through which we support the security of our energy supplies and the development of wind and peat power in Ireland.  A zero PSO means that we are lessening our dependence upon fossil fuels without burdening business or electricity consumers with any additional costs.  The level of capacity payments, that compensate electricity generators for their long run costs, will also be 15% lower in 2010 compared with 2009.  This represents a direct saving to all electricity consumers in 2010.  Taken together, these actions will benefit all businesses, including both large energy users and SMEs, by significantly reducing the level of energy costs they would otherwise face in 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">Working with the CER, my Department is also investigating the scope for further permanent structural changes to our electricity markets that will benefit business.  These changes include some re-balancing of network tariffs, as well as recovering carbon windfall gains from electricity generators.  The CER is also about to commence work on a 5-year review of network expenditure.  The review is designed to ensure that ESB, EirGrid and BGE make even greater efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure, thus driving down costs to all consumers. CER will ensure that this review is rigorous in the interests notably of mitigating energy costs for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in place, the sale of ESB generation capacity, entry of new players and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1066">The contract for the Power Of One campaign ended on 31 December 2008 and has not been renewed.  Since 1 January 2009, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has assumed responsibility for promotion of energy efficient behaviour in the residential sector, using the Power of One brand which has been very effectively established over the last three years.  SEI has a statutory remit for this role under the Sustainable Energy Act 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">As part of these new arrangements, the stand-alone Power of One website was terminated and relevant campaign materials were migrated to the existing SEI website content management and hosting infrastructure, where they were combined with SEI's existing consumer advice materials.  This will result in savings of approximately €144,000 per annum, based on the average annual costs of building, developing, maintaining and hosting the Power of One website under the previous outsourced arrangements over the 3 years 2006 to 2008.  SEI has incurred once-off costs for this migration of €36,000 and an additional €10,000 on development costs for new components of the website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">I understand that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has responsibility for the change.ie campaign, is in the process of terminating the change.ie website.  This involves migrating the content of the change.ie website to the websites of ENFO and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  This will also result in savings in respect of hosting and maintenance.  Given the broader remit of the change.ie campaign in relation to climate change matters, including transport, waste, water, biodiversity and planning, the merger of the change.ie website with those of ENFO and the EPA is considered more appropriate than a merger with SEI's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1070">The promotion of the sustainable generation and use of energy is being supported in a variety of ways in the electricity, transport and heat sectors, as well as through the promotion of energy efficiency across the economy.  Renewable electricity generation is currently supported through the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff programme (REFIT) which has been in operation since 2006.  There are now around 1,400 megawatts of renewable powered capacity generating electricity. These plants contributed 12.2% of all electricity consumed in 2008.  The amount of renewable-powered plant connected and accessing the electricity grid is increasing steadily from year to year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">Under European Directive 2001/77/EC, Ireland was set a target of 13.2% for renewable electricity to be achieved by 2010. Ireland is on track to exceed this target and will meet a higher national target of 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010.  The Government has set targets to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity consumed from 15% in 2010 to 40% by 2020.  The 40% electricity target is consistent with the new EU target addressed to Ireland in Directive 2009/28/EC to increase the contribution from renewable sources to 16% of all energy consumed (to include electricity, transport and heating) by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">The Government has also set a target to develop 500 MW of ocean powered electricity by 2020.  The development of ocean energy technologies is still at early deployment stage, with the first full scale prototypes just beginning to emerge globally.  I am committed to the realisation of the full potential of Ireland's ocean energy, and the Ocean Energy Development Unit of Sustainable Energy Ireland, is leading the implementation of the Ocean Energy Programme that encompasses the construction of a grid connected test site for these prototypes, and a Prototype Development Fund. I welcome the announcement by Sustainable Energy Ireland that €4.3millon is being provided to 10 Irish companies developing ocean and tidal energy devices under this fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">The Government's target for Renewable Heating is 12%.  There are a number of schemes in place to support this — including the Greener Homes Scheme (which supports domestic renewable heating), the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme, which is aimed at institutional, industrial and retail users of heat, and the Combined Heat and Power Programme.  Transport is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and biofuels offer one potential means to counter rising emissions levels in the sector. The Government is committed to the sustainable development of an Irish biofuels market in line with overall EU biofuel policy developments.  The National Biofuel Obligation, which will come into effect in mid July 2010, will provide the market with long term stability, while also integrating the EU Sustainability Criteria, once they are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">As a result of the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes introduced in 2005 and 2006 the market penetration rate for biofuels as a percentage of road transport fuels has increased from zero to just under 2% in 2008. Electric Vehicles offer another means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time tackling Ireland's dependence on imported fossil fuels.  The Government target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, will equate to 225,000 cars on Irish roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Energy efficiency is generally acknowledged to be the cheapest way to meet our energy policy goals and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Energy efficiency is at the heart of European and domestic economic recovery programmes.  The Government has committed to achieving 20% energy savings across the economy by 2020.  As part of this energy efficiency drive, the Government has also committed to achieving a 33% energy saving across the Public Sector by 2020.  I launched the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in May 2009.  The Action Plan sets out 90 actions that the Government are either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the energy efficiency targets whilst reducing our CO2 emissions by approximately 5.7 million tonnes.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately €1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.</p>

The Government therefore agreed in July that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) be asked to undertake a measure of rebalancing of network tariffs next year in favour of large energy users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Any rebalancing of tariffs will not take place until October 2010 following a full public consultation by the CER.  It is also the case that further falls in fossil fuel prices, coupled with the further efficiencies being driven by CER and the entry of new more efficient generating plant to our electricity market could, in fact, offset any potential rise in domestic electricity rates in 2010.  It also should be noted that major savings, which can more than offset any rebalancing, are already available to electricity consumers who decide to switch electricity suppliers and more than 10% of customers have availed of these opportunities so far this year.  In addition, there are a number of concrete actions that any customer can take to reduce their electricity consumption and hence their electricity bill as advised by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and reinforced by the "Power of One" campaign.</p>

            <p eId="para_1082">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the now concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Under phase I of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) 27 MANs are available to customers from eNet, which is operating, managing and maintaining the networks on behalf of the State under a 15-year concession agreement.  Under Phase II of the MANs Programme, 59 MANs covering 66 towns have been completed.  Construction of the remaining networks will be completed during 2010.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 83% of SMEs and 66% of Irish households now have a broadband connection.  Additionally, ComReg's quarterly report for Q2 2009, states that 70.1% of those SMEs and 66.9% of those households have a connection in the higher speed category of 2mbps — 10mbps.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). The wider policy objectives of the NBS are (i) to address the market's failure to provide broadband in the more remote parts of rural Ireland, (ii) to address economic and social exclusion concerns due to a lack of broadband access and (iii) to enhance the competitiveness of the regions for foreign and indigenous investment.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are located within the NBS area and who seek a service.  The network is being rolled out progressively and all of the Electoral Districts in the NBS coverage area are required to be enabled by the end of September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">A key area of government policy is to develop the knowledge workers and digital citizens of the future. Connected schools will underpin this aim. As a start, 78 post-primary schools have been selected to participate in a pilot project that will see them equipped with 100 megabits per second of broadband connectivity and Local Area Networks (LAN) installed.  It is expected that schools will begin to be connected in the coming months and that all schools in the pilot project will be connected by mid-2010.  I am also considering how the provision of broadband services to unserved rural premises can be achieved through an appropriate intervention under the European Economic Recovery Package (EERP).  My Department is currently considering options for the design of such a scheme.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in 2010 and conclude it in 2011.  Discussions with the European Commission on the necessary State Aid clearance have commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">The policy framework for future broadband development is set out in the policy paper on Next Generation Broadband, which I published in June.  A central commitment is that Ireland will have universal access to broadband by 2010 and that by 2012 our broadband speeds will equal or exceed those in comparator EU regions.  I am also actively engaged with the EU Commission's review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications.  Effective regulation, and more consistency in regulatory approaches across all the Member States, will enhance the conditions necessary for investment in communications technology and allow Ireland exploit the opportunities such technology brings for the benefit of our economy and society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">The Greener Homes Scheme, which supports installation of renewable heating technology in homes, is now in its third phase.  To date, over 37,000 people have applied for grant aid under the Greener Homes Scheme, and nearly €61m has been paid to over 24,000 applicants.  The scheme was designed from the outset to act as a market stimulation measure.  The renewable heating sector was characterised by a lack of information about products, a lack of retail outlets for equipment and fuels and a lack of trained installers.  By acting to stimulate demand, Greener Homes has redressed the most fundamental problem in the market, backed up by quality assurance and training programmes.  As the market has developed, grant aid rates have been reduced and the new buildings were made ineligible, in tandem with changes to the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">In the most recent Budget, the Greener Homes Scheme received an allocation of €12.345m.  Due to continuing demand for the programme, an additional €3m was allocated to the programme, which remains open for business.  The Greener Homes Scheme will continue to be kept under regular review in light of the growing maturity of the market and overall budgetary considerations.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1091">The Department and others have been working, and continue to work, on addressing the digital divide with a range of measures to promote digital engagement.  One of the issues has been access to the technology and infrastructure — this is being addressed both by the market and in the case of areas where broadband provision remains an issue through the National Broadband Scheme in which the Department is investing substantially.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">Skills are one of the key issues when considering the digital divide.  Skills provision is being addressed in several ways.  There are also training opportunities available across the country provided by community, voluntary and not for profit organisations.  The Department has assisted some of these initiatives though various eInclusion grant schemes.  In addition, training options also exist for people in libraries and in night classes throughout the country and from a range of private sector training providers.  People are able to acquire the skills they need by learning them from friends and relatives.  Research conducted recently in partnership with the Department indicated that 35% of people over the age of 50 were benefiting from the Internet "by proxy" (e.g. a family member or carer) even though they do not use it directly themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">We also now need to explore other approaches to addressing needs. <i> </i>In the context of the formulation of the new Knowledge Society Strategy, the Department will be consulting with stakeholders, and looking at research and developments here and internationally; to explore other ways to promote increased digital engagement.  We are also working with our EU partners to explore other ways to encourage and promote digital participation and we will continue to look at potentially effective approaches in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1095">The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) contract guarantees that broadband connectivity will be available to 100% of the buildings within the NBS coverage areas.  In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very costly and technologically challenging to reach using standard infrastructure, a limited number of residences and businesses in the NBS coverage area may be covered by a satellite service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">The NBS contract defines specific thresholds and circumstances under which satellite can be deployed and allows for a maximum of 8% of residences and businesses to be served utilising satellite technology. It is anticipated that the actual deployment of satellite will be around 5% of residences and businesses within the NBS coverage area. It is a matter for the NBS service provider, "3", to decide where a satellite solution will be deployed, provided that the overall number of residences and businesses served by satellite does not exceed defined thresholds for each county and the NBS coverage area as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">The NBS contract guarantees that the satellite service will deliver minimum speeds of 1 megabit download and 128 kilobits upload with a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, a round-trip latency of 800 milliseconds and an 11 gigabyte (10 down, 1 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit. Regardless of the technology deployed, the same monthly charge of €19.99 and the same once-off installation cost of €49 apply.  As a commercial matter, 3 has entered into a contract with two satellite providers on a non-exclusive basis for the provision of the NBS satellite service. I understand that Avanti is one of these companies.</p>

My Department and the agencies under its aegis will continue to manage their staffing resources within the budget allocation in a manner which will ensure that priority is given to achieving the key activities and objectives of the Department.</p>

          </question>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_1288">Last November, I launched the Government Statement on Transforming Public Services, which sets out an ambitious programme of renewal for the entire Public Service.  TPS represents the blueprint for a new type of unified public service, focused on common goals, with greater cooperation and reduced boundaries between sectors, organisations and professions, with a much greater integration of services around user needs and far greater efficiency in internal data sharing and administration through shared service models.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The programme is designed to address the immediate priority of securing maximum value for public spending and laying the foundation for a complete overhaul of how the Public Service is managed and does its business, to ensure that it is efficient and effective in meeting the needs of citizens.  The TPS agenda is necessarily very broad and encompasses the whole of the Public Service — the health sector, the education sector, the Civil Service, non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, local authorities and regional bodies, the Gardaí and the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">Implementation of the change programme is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Transforming Public Services, which I chair.  The work of the Cabinet Committee is being supported by a Steering Group of Secretaries General and the TPS Programme Office, which is based in my Department.  Progress has been made in a number of areas to date:</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The<b> Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes</b> has finalised its work.  Its report was published last July and its recommendations are under consideration in the context of the Estimates;</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">An<b>eGovernment Policy Unit </b>has been established within the Department of Finance on foot of responsibility for eGovernment policy and central operations being consolidated in that Department;</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">Significant savings can be realised from the improved<b>professionalisation of procurement </b>and, to this end, the new National Public Procurement Operations Unit has been established within the Office of Public Works. This Unit is working to leverage the Public Service’s buying power by organising procurement across the Public Service of common goods and services.  It is envisaged that the Unit will achieve savings from a combination of price reductions, administrative efficiencies and demand management;</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">Work is ongoing in developing specific proposals in the area of<b>shared services </b>on the basis that there are potential savings associated with such initiatives.  Groups of senior officials have been established to advance shared services in both the <b>HR and financial shared services area</b> and these Groups presented initial reports to the Cabinet Committee on Transforming Public Services in July.  On foot of these reports, shared services projects are being progressed in a number of sectors;</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">The<b> Organisational Review Programme (ORP)</b> has been extended so that all Government Departments and major Offices will be reviewed within the next three years.  Four organisations are being reviewed this year — the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the Property Registration Authority (PRA).  The fieldwork on the review of the PRA has been completed, is in the final stages in the cases of the CSO and the Department of Health and Children, and has commenced in Revenue.  The reviews are due to be published around the end of the year and will be accompanied by follow-up action plans on the key findings prepared by each of the four organisations;</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">A new round of<b>Value for Money Reviews</b> was approved by Government in late 2008.  Reviews, under the new arrangements for the Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative, are underway or due to commence in 12 Departments for completion by end 2009.  These Reviews focus on evaluations of significant areas of expenditure and major policy issues with a focus on Health, Education, Social Welfare and Justice sectors.  They ensure that programmes are delivering outcomes in line with expectations and identify appropriate policy responses where they are not;</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">Work is underway in relation to the development of new performance and governance frameworks for<b>State Agencies</b>, and the greater use of Service Level Agreements in this context;</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">Work has also commenced on some of the numerous commitments in relation to<b>improving customer focus.   </b>A group of senior officials is currently examining the feasibility of introducing <b>a single point of telephone contact service</b> and is developing a fully costed business plan to support this work.  A group has also been established to determine the feasibility and value of mechanisms to <b>simplify the provision of means information by citizens to public bodies;</b>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1299">These measures are in parallel to projects and initiatives previously established under the<b>Quality Customer Service Initiative</b>.  The objective of this Initiative has been to enhance the citizen’s experience in their interaction with the Public Service.  Central to this objective is the <b>Customer Charter initiative</b>, under which organisations consult with their customers, set targets, measure progress and report publicly on the results.  As recommended in TPS, the Charter process is now in the process of being strengthened and extended throughout the Public Service so as to ensure a consistent and quality standard of service whether, for example, from a Government Department, a Local Authority or a Garda Station; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The exchange of best practice across the Public Service is also being facilitated through the<b>Public Service Excellence Awards</b>.  These Awards, for which entries are currently being sought, recognise examples of excellence in administration and customer service.  My Department is also undertaking satisfaction <b>surveys of Civil Service customers</b>.  The results of these surveys, of citizens and businesses, should be available by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">A number of priority actions from TPS, such as the redeployment of staff to areas of highest priority and extending individual performance management systems across the Public Service, are the subject of discussions with the Public Service unions at present.  TPS also provides for the publication of the first Annual Report on the State of the Public Service.  This Report will outline progress on leading change in each of the sectors and the extent to which the integration objective is being addressed across the Service as a whole.

            <p eId="para_1304">All FÁS services are open to people with disabilities.  FÁS provides vocational training for the unemployed and new entrants to the labour market through specific skills training and traineeships. FÁS also provides training for those in employment through apprenticeships and in-company training.  A person with a disability may call into a FÁS Employment Service Office for information, advice and guidance in relation to vocational training and employment.  People with disabilities may be supported while in employment by FÁS through the following programmes:</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">The Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ people with disabilities who work more than 20 hours per week.  The subsidies are structured under three strands and the employer can benefit from one, or all, simultaneously. As a positive action for apprentices with disabilities, a total of twenty places is available on a national basis this year under the Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">The Supported Employment Programme is an open labour market initiative providing people with disabilities with supports to help them access the open labour market. It is implemented by sponsor organisations on behalf of FÁS who employ job coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a job seeker.  The ultimate outcome is that the employee becomes independent of job coach support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">FÁS operates a series of private sector employment supports under its reasonable accommodation fund to assist people with disabilities to access and progress in employment. It also provides supports for employers and job seekers. Programmes under these headings include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">Job Interview/Personal Reader Grant</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">Employee Retention Grant</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">Disability Awareness Training Grant Scheme</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">Technical Employment Support Grant</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Further details on the above programmes and supports are available on the FÁS website www.fas.ie. In addition to the above-mentioned programmes and supports, people with disabilities may also avail of work experience and training under the FÁS Community Employment (CE) Programme. Approximately 25% of the participants on CE are people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">Over the past number of months my Department has led on the advancement of an outline for a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities in consultation with key stakeholder representatives on the Department's Consultative Forum. The aim of this strategy, which meets a commitment under the Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, 2005, is to address the diversity of circumstances, needs and abilities of people with disabilities, and to work towards achieving the highest possible levels of employment for them.  In order to facilitate further partnership between Government Departments and agencies, my Department, in collaboration with the Department of Health and Children, has recently established a Cross Sectoral Group to further advance the completion of the comprehensive strategy for people with disabilities.</p>

Contact can be made with the relevant organisations either directly or through the dedicated Tús Nua website (www.tusnua.ie) put in place through a collaborative initiative between various State agencies and regionally located educational institutions in the Mid West to assist redundant workers in assessing their options for alternative employment and further training or education.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1325">I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 69 to 71, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">My Department received a collective redundancy notification in relation to proposed redundancies at the company in question on 14 August 2009.  Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme administered by my Department and funded from the Social Insurance Fund, the essential function of my Department is to ensure that all eligible employees receive the statutory minimum redundancy entitlements due to them. Currently, the statutory redundancy entitlements for all qualifying employees are two weeks pay per year of service plus a bonus week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">There are two types of redundancy payment made from the Social Insurance Fund — redundancy rebates of 60% which are payable to employers who have paid the minimum statutory redundancy payments to qualifying employees and, statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent or not in a position to pay. In the case of employers who pay the statutory redundancy payments to their employees, they are entitled, by virtue of their social insurance contributions, to avail of a 60% rebate in respect of the redundancy payments paid out.  Neither the Tánaiste nor I have any role in relation to the negotiation of ex gratia payments to employees in excess of the statutory minimum payments — this is entirely a matter of discretion for the company and an issue for negotiation as between the employees and the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">In accordance with Sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, companies are required to consult employees' representatives and to supply certain information regarding proposed redundancies.  Should it be the case that there is dissatisfaction about the level of consultation and information as set down in the Act, it is possible for a complaint to be taken before the Rights Commissioner Service who will hear the case and communicate the outcome to the parties involved.  An appeal can lie from a decision of the Rights Commissioner to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">I understand that a conciliation conference involving the parties was held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission on 8 October last, and that both sides agreed to reflect on their respective positions and revert to the LRC shortly. The experience and expertise of the Commission offers an appropriate avenue for resolving these issues.  In this context, I would encourage both parties to avail of the professional services of the Commission in their efforts to resolve their differences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery free of charge to assist this process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing an extensive set of legislative conditions on the parties to an industrial dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">It is always open to those affected in situations where the rationalisation of a company's operations may be at issue to utilise the Industrial Relations mechanisms of the state — the Labour Relations Commission and/or the Labour Court — to further claims intended to identify and promote alternative strategies in an effort to forestall or mitigate the negative employment consequences of any such rationalisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1335">The amounts spent by my Department on overtime and on other non-core pay items in 2008 and to the end of September 2009 are set out on the table below.  The figures on the table include costs for my Department and its Offices.  They also include expenditure related to the National Consumer Agency, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), the Competition Authority and the Labour Relations Commission, as my Department manages the payroll function for those agencies.

            <p eId="para_1336">The non-core pay costs provided on the table below include various allowances payable in accordance with civil service provisions.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that in addition to the amounts shown on the table, expenditure was incurred by my Department in 2008 and 2009 on certain items that are not strictly considered to be either core or non-core pay costs.  In particular, my Department spent €2,933,156.42 in 2008 and €2,181,063.14 million to the end of September 2009 on fees, paid primarily to Rights Commissioners and Members of the Employment Appeals Tribunal for hearings attended.  My Department also paid €106,732.90 on severance and redundancy payments in 2008 to staff whose contracts ended that year.  The corresponding figure for 2009 was €53,617.19.</p>

            <p eId="para_1349">The Enterprise Development agencies do not distinguish between individual postal districts of the city when promoting investment and jobs in Dublin.  With the availability of public transport, travel to work should not be a barrier for job seeking within the greater Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">Despite the difficult global economic situation, I have made a number of significant announcements for Dublin this year concerning developments in Enterprise Development agency client companies such as AMPAC (American Pacific Corporation), IBM Corporation, Rottapharm, Paypal Europe Services, Helsinn Birex and Dublin Aerospace Ltd — a new aviation maintenance provider based at Dublin Airport which is expected to employ 226 people within five years.  In general, Dublin has a unique value proposition based on its critical mass, skills offering, infrastructure and track record in winning valuable investment commitments over the years and is well placed to win further investment in the future but, in the final analysis, the decision on the location of the new enterprise or investment lies with the investor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland.  At the end of 2008, the latest date for which figures are available, Dublin was home to 466 IDA supported companies employing 51,674 people.  While Dublin has traditionally been a centre for manufacturing industry for FDI, in recent years there has been a shift away from manufacturing to a knowledge based higher value added project in areas such as fund management, e-Commerce, Software and high-end Back Office and Digital Media.  In terms of FDI, Dublin has been a success story with a critical mass of population, skills pool, educational infrastructure, international access connections, business activity across all sectors and extensive property solutions for future activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">Enterprise Ireland is the lead Government agency responsible for the development of Irish enterprise.  Its mission is to accelerate the development of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in world markets and to assist the achievement of productivity gains, internationalisation and export growth. Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports, both financial and non-financial, to Irish companies, targeted at the specific requirements of clients to ensure that they develop to their full potential in terms of employment, innovation and exports.   In recognising the significant changes in the current economy both in Ireland and globally, Enterprise Ireland has prepared a new recovery strategy to prioritise actions to assist clients in 2009.  The agency has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of their client base and has developed a series of proposals which deal with access to finance, winning new sales, encouraging competitiveness, continuous innovation and R&amp;D, and development of entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">To assist companies in financial difficulties due to the current economic climate, I launched the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund earlier this year and €50m has been included in the estimate of my Department for this purpose in 2009.  Under the scheme, Enterprise Ireland may provide up to €500,000 to viable companies with robust business models that are facing difficulties as a result of the current economic environment. The fund supplies direct financial support to internationally trading enterprises that are investing in cost reduction or other measures to gain sales in overseas markets.  I have also announced a €250m Scheme to protect up to 27,400 vulnerable jobs in the economy. The Temporary Employment Subsidy Scheme will provide a subsidy of €9,100 per employee over 15 months to qualifying exporting enterprises in the manufacturing and/or internationally traded services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">As part of its role to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout the city of Dublin, including the Coolock, Dublin 5 and 17 areas, the Dublin City Enterprise Board (CEB) is delivering a series of Programmes to underpin this role in providing financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  Business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in the activities of the CEB.  The forms of financial assistance available include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">Recent activities include liaison with the VEC in Coolock regarding a ‘Start Your Own Business' programme, attendance by the CEB's Business Adviser at the Darndale Enterprise Centre committee to advise on available supports and CEB Business Adviser interaction with the Northside Partnership concerning CEB/Partnership working arrangements and the provision of services to the area.  During 2009, Dublin City Enterprise Board has supported enterprise development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">FÁS currently operates an Employment Services Office in the Civic Centre, Bunratty Road, Coolock and the agency also funds the Northside Partnership Local Employment Services in the area.  All job seekers, who register with FÁS and the Local Employment Services are offered assessment, guidance, other support and information, including job information, as appropriate.  FÁS, whose Employment Programmes include Community Employment, Job Initiative, Supported Employment and an Employment Support Scheme, is currently targeting the Northside Partnership area, which includes the Dublin 5 and 17 areas, with a number of specific programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1358">The background to this dispute is that last June, Coca Cola HBC announced its decision to outsource those remaining elements of its distribution and warehousing operations that had previously been done in-house, affecting 130 of its employees spread across six sites: Dublin, Cork, Killarney, Tipperary town, Tuam and Waterford.  I understand that the workers were advised that they could choose between taking redundancy or transferring to three new outsourced contractors on the same terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">I am aware that there have been extensive efforts to resolve this dispute and the services of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court have been utilised by the parties.  Most recently, a Labour Court hearing was conducted on 18 September pursuant to Section 20(1) of the 1969 Industrial Relations Act, which makes the Court's recommendation binding on the party that brought the case, in this case SIPTU.  The Labour Court issued its recommendation on 21 September.  The Labour Court recommended that the company should offer a redundancy package along the lines envisaged in the SIPS (Single Island Production System) deal that had been negotiated between the company and the union in recent years.  The Court also recommended that the company and the union should have further discussions on the union's proposal to conduct a feasibility study in relation to the Dublin facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">I understand that the company decided not to accept the Court's recommendation.  I regret that the company has not found it possible to accept in full the recommendations made by the Labour Court to help resolve this dispute.  I recognise that the company may be under extreme financial pressures in the current climate.  However, continued engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers, in my view, the best way whereby the parties involved in this dispute can hope to resolve their differences.</p>

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and, statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned in November, 2008, claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the onus is on the employer to provide to the Department proof by way of financial statements/certification by an Accountant/Solicitor in order to substantiate the claim.  In this case, the company has not responded to requests from the Department seeking the submission of supporting documentation.  Unfortunately, in such instances, the Department cannot pay out on claims in the absence of such evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">In cases of this nature where no progress can be made with the employer to provide the information required by the Department, the applicant is advised, as in this case, to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to obtain a determination establishing the employee's right to redundancy.  My Department understands that the individual in question has decided to go this route and is currently awaiting a hearing date with the Tribunal.  If the EAT decides in favour of the individual's right to redundancy entitlement, the claim can then be processed by my Department.</p>

         asked the

         the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has not received their redundancy payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_247">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1370">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and, statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned in June 2009, claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the Department requires the submission of proof including financial accounts/certification by an Accountant/Solicitor to substantiate the claim before it can process the claim for payment. In the absence of this evidence, the Department cannot process the claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">In this case, the evidence required by the Department has been provided in relation to previous claims from this employer dating from late 2008 and early 2009 the most recent of which were paid in April of this year.  There are two outstanding claims (including the claim in respect of the individual named) in respect of this employer and I am advised that these claims will be paid over the next 1-2 weeks.  Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed online from March ‘09 and those submitted by post from February ‘09.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June '09.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2009 at 60,785 an increase of 122% on the same period last year (27,373). This figure of 60,785 exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">Efforts continue to be made by the Tánaiste and I to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 53.8;</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1587">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) entered into force on 1st January 2007.  Strict eligibility criteria, both under the original 2006 EU Regulation and its amendment this year, apply before an application can be made by a Member State. Given that the objective of the EGF is to react quickly and effectively to large-scale redundancies occasioned by globalisation factors, this includes the requirement that an application must be made within 10 weeks of the date on which the relevant conditions are met and which have resulted in job losses of the requisite number under the Regulation. The initial threshold was 1,000 but now it has been halved to 500.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">The majority of the job losses experienced in the textile sector in County Donegal pre-dated the entry into force of the EGF Regulation and, accordingly, no application in relation to them was possible by reference to the governing conditions of the Fund.  However, all State funded supports for workers affected by redundancy at the time were provided nationally through State agencies such as FÁS and Enterprise Ireland, as well as through the vocational and further education sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1592">As the Deputy is aware, I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax would come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of €10 per passenger would apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.  The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 confirmed the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009. However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 applies to departures from <i>any</i> Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow are subject to the €2 rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand. The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.  It should be recognised that tourists are only subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should have only a very limited effect on tourist numbers. The Government appreciates the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. Indeed the decline in the number of people travelling is also evident in those countries where there is no air travel tax in place.  We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure. The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it is a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1598">I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 128 and 129 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF) has a special unit entitled OLAF Task Group Cigarettes, which co-ordinates both international operations and other countermeasures undertaken by the authorities of the Member States against cigarette smuggling. The OLAF also maintains a database of cigarette seizures reported by the authorities of the Member States. In this regard, the number of cigarettes seized by Ireland in 2008 was 10th in the table of seizures. This is the only data available to the authorities for comparison between the Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">I am aware that a report commissioned by a major international cigarette manufacturer has been compiled annually in recent years and contains estimates of the illicit trade in each Member State. This report is provided on a confidential basis to the individual tax authority of each Member State in respect of themselves only. The Revenue Commissioners advise that it is a subjective assessment of the situation which relies heavily on empty pack surveys that are merely an indicator of the presence of untaxed product in a market but do not differentiate between smuggled product and legal cross-border purchases. It is also difficult to extrapolate the results of empty pack surveys to calculate the overall level of infiltration of the market by contraband product.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">It is, in any event, difficult to make meaningful comparisons between cigarette seizures by different Member States. This is because a variety of factors need to be taken into account including population, geographical location, the level of cigarette taxes imposed and how this compares with neighbouring countries; whether a transit country or country of destination is involved, accessibility by air, sea or road etc. The modus operandi of smuggling illicit cigarettes in maritime freight is quite similar across the EU while "ant smuggling" (high frequency/low volume movements) is generally concentrated at the external EU land boundary. Ant smuggling by travellers by air seems to be concentrated in Ireland, probably due to the availability of frequent, low cost flights from Eastern Europe where cheap tax-paid cigarettes are freely available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">The methods used by the Customs Services throughout the EU to tackle cigarette smuggling are similar and involve a combination of detection, seizure and prosecution using an amalgamation of profiling, intelligence gathering, co-operation between Customs Services and scanning. In this regard, Revenue acquired its first mobile container scanner in 2006 and I was pleased to be in a position to provide funding this year towards the cost of a second mobile scanner, which is due to arrive in Ireland next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">Revenue works closely with the legitimate tobacco industry. Ireland, along with the other Member States, has ratified two international agreements concluded by OLAF with global cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, with a view to tackling the illicit trade in counterfeit and contraband cigarettes. Revenue also works closely with the local tobacco industry and the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee (ITMAC) with a view to identifying illicit cigarettes on sale in the State and current trends and trading patterns. In addition Revenue co-operates and shares information with the Office of Tobacco Control (OTC).</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">As regards the question of the need for a multi-agency approach to tackle cigarette smuggling, I am advised that there is excellent co-operation and sharing of information between Revenue and An Garda Síochána and, where appropriate, these two agencies participate jointly in major anti-smuggling operations. In the case of cross-border operations, the PSNI and HMRC are also involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">The penalties for cigarette smuggling provided under legislation on summary conviction, are a monetary fine not exceeding €5,000 and/or a custodial sentence not exceeding 12 months. These are the maximum penalties that can be imposed at District Court level. The penalties for conviction on indictment are €12,695 or treble the duty-paid value, whichever is the greater, and/or a custodial sentence not exceeding 5 years. These penalties are considered adequate.  Of course, as the Deputy is aware, the precise penalty imposed on conviction in each individual case is a matter for the Court. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that during the first 9 months of 2009, there were 92 convictions for cigarette smuggling and 9 convictions for selling untaxed cigarettes. In the case of cigarette smuggling, custodial sentences were imposed in 18 cases, of which 9 were suspended; Community Service Orders were imposed in 5 cases and over €40,000 in fines were imposed in the remaining cases. In the case of illegal selling, over €20,000 in fines were imposed in 8 cases, while a suspended sentence was imposed in the remaining case.  In relation to the seizure statistics quoted, it should be noted that 74.5m cigarettes were seized in 2007 and 135.2m in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1611">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that flat-rate farmers are not in the normal course entitled to credit for, or repayment of, VAT incurred by them on business inputs.  The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 25) Order 1993 provides for refunds to flat-rate farmers for VAT borne on the "construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building or structure which is designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  However, while the installation of a wind turbine may be the construction of a structure, such a structure is not "designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  It is designed rather to generate electricity for wherever required.  Consequently, the installation of wind turbines does not come within the scope of the refund order.</p>

            <p eId="para_1613">An income tax exemption for charities is available under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 and the exemption is extended to cover Corporation Tax by section 76 of the same Act.  No such exemption is available for VAT.  To avail of the charitable tax exemption a body must be established for charitable purposes only and must apply all of its income for charitable purposes only.  A body established for the primary purpose of manufacturing and retailing grave headstones would not be considered as established for charitable purposes only.  Therefore such a body could not avail of the tax exemption and would be treated as a taxable entity by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">Bodies holding charitable tax exemptions can carry on trading activities that are ancillary to their wholly and exclusively charitable objects.  Charities may also set up subsidiary trading companies to carry on trading activities.  These subsidiary trading companies are not entitled to a charitable tax exemption and are fully taxable on their profits.  Where a charity sets up a trading taxable subsidiary, it must ensure that the arrangement does not put at undue risk any assets of the charity.  The interests of the charity must be protected and investment of the charity's resources must ultimately be for the benefit of the charity.  Bodies that are granted charitable tax exemption are subject to periodic risk-focused reviews by Revenue towards ensuring that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled.</p>

            <p eId="para_1670">The popularity of endowment mortgages was at its height during the late 1980s and early 1990s, driven by factors such as mortgage interest relief and tax relief.  Between 1989 and 1992 endowment mortgages represented over one third of total mortgages approved in Ireland but by 2003 the number of endowment mortgages approved as a percentage of total mortgages was only 3.4%.  In 2004 the Financial Regulator wrote to the major life insurance companies and credit institutions seeking information on outstanding endowment mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">The survey found that 47,759 endowment policies, which were originally linked to interest-only mortgages, remained in force.  Of those, 23,264 still retained the related mortgage.  This meant that 24,495 policyholders appeared to have repaid the related mortgage while retaining the endowment policy as a savings product.  Mortgage lenders estimated that the outstanding endowment related mortgage loan amount owed at that time was approximately €1.2 billion.  This represented 1.46% of the €82.23 billion residential mortgages of Irish residents as at 30 June 2005.  The figure for residential mortgages of Irish residents as at 30 June 2009 was €113.86 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">It is not possible to state with certainty to what extent the maturity value of endowment policies will fall short of the amount required to repay the outstanding mortgage principal as this will depend on a range of issues, principally the performance of investment markets over the remaining term of the policy.  However, at the time of the survey, the projected aggregate shortfall was estimated to be of the order of €89 million over the following 15 years.</p>

I recently announced, following discussions with the motor industry, the introduction of a new VAT margin scheme on second-hand cars with effect from 1 January 2010.  Under the margin scheme, dealers will account for VAT on their profit margin, that is, on the difference between the cost of acquiring the car and its reselling price.  This will apply to all second-hand cars purchased and resold on or after 1 January 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_1679">It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  Home repossession should be and generally is the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.  There are a number of important initiatives in place at this time to assist consumers who have fallen into debt or are in danger of falling into debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">In terms of ensuring that people can continue to afford their mortgages the Government provides support for payment of mortgages under the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  This scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's principal private residence.  Furthermore, people in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).  This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.  The Irish Banking Federation (IBF) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service recently agreed an Operational Protocol on consumer debt.  The Operational Protocol will enable MABS and the IBF to continue to work together effectively when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors who approach the MABS for assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code sets out requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">The Financial Regulator also has in place a code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  This code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator.  Under the code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender has to make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and the lender has to give consideration on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing the type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest.  Obviously cases will arise where the arrears situations persist despite newly agreed changes in repayment schedules.  The code provides that where the arrears situation persists, the lender may reserve the right to enforce the mortgage agreement.  However, it must wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">Furthermore, as part of their recapitalisation scheme, AIB and Bank of Ireland will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.  I am satisfied that these measures provide very significant safeguards for people who are experiencing difficulties in repaying their mortgage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1685">While the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is responsible for energy including biofuels policy, the Finance Act 2006 provided for excise relief for some 163 million litres of biofuel per annum over five years to end 2010.  Under the scheme, biofuel produced by projects approved by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are exempt from excise duty.  This serves to reduce the additional costs associated with the production of biofuels and consequently allows them to compete with conventional fossil fuels.  The primary purpose of the scheme is to encourage the use of biofuels on the Irish market.  It was also hoped that it would help in part to kick start the domestic biofuels industry in producing biofuel feedstock and blending in Ireland.  Long-term general excise reliefs are not anticipated for biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">The Finance Act 2006 provision led to a competitive scheme in 2006, run by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which allocated excise relief to 16 companies and consortia (out of 102 applicants).  None of the 16 successful applicants was awarded the full amount of relief that they applied for.  Under this scheme, the company in question received excise relief on 32 million litres of biofuel blends.  According to returns to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, as at the end of August 2009, it had used some 3.2 million litres or about 10% of its allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Despite having used to date only a small proportion of its original allocation the company is now seeking a further additional allocation under the scheme.  There are no plans to reallocate excise relief under the scheme.  In that context I would draw to the Deputy's attention to the fact that the forthcoming Biofuel Obligation Scheme, being introduced in 2010, will be of benefit to the company in expanding the market of biofuels in Ireland, and underpinning the development of that market in future years.  The introduction of the obligation will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage (probably 4%) of their annual fuel sales.  The obligation is designed to provide a long-term market based framework for the development of a biofuels sector and delivery of biofuels targets to 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_1777">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that at present services supplied by travel agents and tour operators are treated as exempt from VAT.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 amended the Value-Added Tax Act 1972 to provide for the introduction of a travel agents margin scheme.  This scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers.  The travel agents who organise walking and cycling holidays in the State, to which the Deputy refers, would appear to be acting in the capacity of a principal.  As such, these will be dealt with for VAT purposes under the provisions of the margin scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">The margin scheme comes into effect on 1 January 2010 and provides for the taxation of the travel agent's margin at the standard rate of VAT, currently 21.5%.  The travel agent will be entitled to claim a VAT input credit in respect of VAT incurred on overheads.  With effect from 1 January 2010 travel agents who act in an intermediary capacity will be taxable in respect of the services they supply, with the charge being levied on their commission at the standard rate of VAT.  A detailed information leaflet on the travel agents margin scheme is available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie.</i>

            <p eId="para_1780">The company has been in run-off since March 1985 following the failure of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  It is operating under the aegis of a court appointed administrator.  The administration has been funded by a range of sources, including the sale of profitable parts of the business, moneys borrowed on normal commercial terms, two advances from the Exchequer which have been repaid, and an annual contribution of €11.7 million from AIB for a period of 20 years which expires in 2012.  The only cost to the Exchequer to date is the interest foregone on the interest free advance of €40.6 million in the period 1993 to 2002.  Current projections indicate that this cost will be more than offset at the conclusion of the administration.  At this stage it is not possible to state when the run-off will be completed due to the long-term nature of some of the liabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1783">Refurbishment expenditure that is capital in nature, for example, additions, alterations or improvements, is not in general an allowable expense.  However, this restriction was relaxed, in the case of "section 23" properties in the various property incentive schemes, such as the urban renewal scheme and the countrywide renewal scheme, provided the rental premises concerned met the relevant conditions for the particular scheme and the refurbishment expenditure was incurred by 31 July 2008.  Details of the various property incentives schemes are available at <i> www.revenue.ie </i>I am satisfied that the code provides adequate allowances for relevant legitimate expenses.</p>

            <p eId="para_1785">The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) is being set up to remove land and development loans and associated loans from the balance sheets of participating institutions.  The uncertainty associated with these loans has prevented banks from lending and supporting economic recovery.  The Government has no plans at present to extend the scope of NAMA beyond land and development loans and associated loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">The Deputy will also note that the revised Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments.  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) on debt default will be further reviewed with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations, including for example the use by banks and lenders of more flexible mechanisms to avoid foreclosure in appropriate circumstances.  With reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions, the Government will also examine ways of expanding its own mortgage-support measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_1794">As costs of arbitration in relation to public procurement can be significant, alternative and more cost effective dispute resolution procedures should be explored by contracting authorities before disputes are referred to arbitration.  Section 3.3.6 of Guidance Note 1.5 in the Capital Works Management Framework published on my Department's website <i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</i>  is relevant to this matter.  It envisages that, as a first step, informal intervention by third parties should be considered with a view to resolving disputes in a non-adversarial way (including mediation) prior to the activation of formal dispute resolution mechanisms for public works contracts.  In addition, once formal dispute resolution proceedings are initiated, conciliation (another cost effective resolution procedure) must be utilised.  Only if that procedure fails and disputes continue may matters under contention be referred to arbitration. </p>

Where a loan has been written down, e.g. by way of a receivership, NAMA will take that into account when determining the long term economic value of a loan.  Furthermore, under section 81 of the NAMA Bill 2009, as initiated, there is a provision that NAMA can opt not to acquire a loan for transfer should it feel it appropriate to do so.  NAMA will work with non-participating institutions to ensure, in so far as possible, an optimal outcome for all parties.</p>

In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with a significant degree of caution.  In addition, increasing the rate could, in theory, lead to a reduction in yield from the tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_1800">As the Deputy is aware on 16 September last, I published an outline of the main elements of the proposed new guarantee scheme for longer term funding, called the draft Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme or ELG scheme.  The ELG scheme must be approved in accordance with EU State aid rules and discussions are continuing in this regard with the European Commission.  The ELG scheme is intended to facilitate the ability of credit institutions in Ireland to issue debt securities and take deposits with a maturity post-September 2010 of up to five years, on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">As I have previously remarked, the new scheme will be somewhat more targeted, and in this regard dated subordinated debt or asset covered securities issued after the introduction of the ELG scheme will not be guaranteed either under the ELG scheme or under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme (the ‘CIFS Scheme').</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">However, all liabilities guaranteed under the CIFS Scheme, including dated subordinated debt, as at the commencement date of the ELG scheme (and in respect of a participating institution, as at the date it avails of a guarantee for the first time under the ELG scheme) will remain unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed under and in accordance with the terms of the CIFS scheme, in other words, existing liabilities will remain guaranteed under the CIFS scheme until the maturity of the debt or the 29 September 2010, whichever is the earliest.  This continued guarantee of existing liabilities is in accordance with the general nature of guarantees.  The ELG scheme will apply to new debt issued or deposits accepted by participating institutions in accordance with the terms of the ELG scheme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1825">I announced in my Budget Statement of 7 April that with effect from 1 May 2009, the number of tax years in respect of which mortgage interest relief may be claimed is seven years for first-time and non-first time buyers.   Revenue subsequently worked with the lending institutions and mortgage account holders on the implementation of the measure.  The objective was to make the implementation as straightforward as possible and to ensure, in so far as possible, that mortgage account holders who were entitled to mortgage interest relief under the new rules got the relief with the minimum of delay and without the need, where possible, for any action on their part.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">I am advised by Revenue that some 242,000 mortgage accounts were held by first-time buyers and payment of relief continued, without interruption, in respect of those accounts.  In respect of 322,000 non-first time buyers, Revenue had enough information on some 57,000 accounts to be able to confirm the accounts were not eligible for interest relief from 1 May 2009.  In respect of the balance of 265,000 accounts, Revenue sourced the necessary information from the mortgage providers to determine eligibility for relief in respect of approximately 150,000 accounts.  In appropriate cases payment of relief was reactivated without the need for any action by the account holder.  Any arrears of relief were or are being automatically credited to such accounts by the lender, again without the need for any action by the account holder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">For the balance of approximately 115,000 cases where Revenue could not confirm eligibility to relief it invited the account holders, if they were entitled to relief under the seven year rule, to provide the necessary information to Revenue.  Some 51,000 of these account holders who believed they had an entitlement to relief, provided the information requested.  Where an entitlement to relief was confirmed by Revenue, the payment of relief was reactivated by Revenue without the need for any further action by the account holder.  Any arrears of relief were or are being automatically credited to such accounts by the lender, again without the need for any action by the account holder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">Subsequently, in a relatively small number of cases where mortgage accounts were consolidated or the mortgage holder secured a top up to their mortgage, Revenue sought specific information from the mortgage holder to determine the exact amount and percentage, if any, that qualifies for the relief.  Revenue is processing some 2,500 completed responses to this information request.  This processing task will be completed within a matter of weeks — payment of relief will in appropriate cases be reactivated and any arrears of relief credited to the accounts.  Some additional changes to Revenue's processing systems are also nearing completion to cater for the reactivation of relief in respect of new qualifying loans taken out by non-first time buyers after 1 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">I am satisfied with the approach taken by Revenue, focused as it was on minimising the effort needed by individual mortgage account holders in establishing their entitlement to mortgage interest relief under the new rules was the correct one.  This has ensured that the appropriate relief has been made available to those who have an entitlement to such relief in the fastest and most efficient manner possible.  It has also ensured that tax relief is correctly paid to those entitled to relief in the targeted way announced by me on 7 April 2009.</p>

         the proposals to rectify the situation as regards carrying out electronic transactions in banks and other financial institutions whereby there is a three day delay in transferring money from one account to a different bank or financial institution or to a different account holder within the same bank or financial institution although it is withdrawn from the first account immediately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1831">While this is not an issue that has been raised by the relevant stakeholders to my Department, I understand that the length of time it takes to clear an electronic transaction is dependent on whether the financial institution is a member of the Irish Retail Electronic Payments Clearing Company Ltd (IRECC).  IRECC is responsible for the clearing and settlement of domestic low-value payments in Ireland.  Any bank or financial institution that does not participate in the IRECC clearing arrangements may have a longer payment clearing cycle.  A list of IRECC members is available directly from the website of the Irish Payment Services Organisation at <i>www.ipso.ie. </i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1832">I might also explain that the length of time for a transaction to be cleared is dependent on the nature of the transaction that is taking place.  For instance, transactions within the same bank will, in most cases, be instantaneous.  If not instantaneous, a transaction will normally be cleared on the same day.  This would apply to accounts within the same branch or different branches of the same bank.  In the case of transfers between different banks, I understand that the inter-bank payment cycle is normally three working days.  However a faster clearing time may be available in the following situations:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1833">(a) in the case of payments made in the payer's bank before that bank's cut-off time for same-day processing (normally early afternoon) the funds will be lodged to the account of the beneficiary by 7 a.m. the following morning; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1834">(b) if the transfer is made in the payer's bank after the cut-off time the moneys will be in the account of the beneficiary on the following working day (i.e. a payment made after the cut-off time on Monday will be in the beneficiary account by 7 a.m. on Wednesday morning).</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">I might also add that such transactions will, from 1 November 2009, be within the scope of the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009, whereby the maximum time for funds to be made available in a recipient's account must be no more than three business days. From 1 January 2012 this period will be reduced to one business day.  However, these periods may be extended by a further business day in the case of paper-initiated payment transactions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1840">I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">I assume that the Deputy is referring to Ireland's obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and in particular the excessive deficit procedure which is governed by Article 104 of the Treaty.  Council Regulations Nos.1466/97 and 1467/97 as amended by Council Regulations Nos.1055/2005 and 1056/2005 respectively govern the operation of the pact.  These regulations variously set out the requirements in relation to the submission, examination and monitoring of stability programmes and the operation of the excessive deficit procedure.  Council Regulation 3605/93 sets out the requirements for the reporting of Government deficit and debt levels.  These regulations are binding and directly applicable in all EU member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">Under the Stability and Growth Pact, member states agree to respect two criteria: a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3% and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60%.  Where a member state exceeds the deficit criteria and where this is deemed to be neither temporary nor close to 3% the excessive deficit procedure is applied by the ECOFIN Council.  On foot of Ireland's deficit figures for 2008 the Ecofin Council issued a recommendation to Ireland in April 2009 under which we are required to reduce the general government deficit to below 3% of GDP by end 2013.  This is in line with the strategy set out in the April supplementary budget.  The full text of the recommendation is available on the Commission website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">Council recommendations are intended to support and encourage the member state(s) concerned in its pursuit of necessary, if difficult, budgetary measures to reduce the deficit below the 3% reference value within an agreed timeframe, while at the same time taking account of economic circumstances.  We are working with the Commission on the Excessive Deficit Procedure and other matters regarding our budgetary strategy.  As is normal in these circumstances, I have been in regular contact with the Commission and with my European colleagues with regard to the position of the public finances.  Furthermore, I would remind the Deputy that the Government strategy has been welcomed by the Commission, the ECB and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">We are committed to acting responsibly in line with the Council recommendation and the priority now is the preparation of budget 2010.  I look forward to the continuing support of the Commission and Council for the overall budgetary strategy of restoring stability to the public finances.</p>

This approach strikes a balance between reflecting the long term potential of these assets while minimising any potential risk that NAMA will make a loss.

            <p eId="para_1872">I am aware of the health issues relating to the use of hydrogenated vegetable oils. The primary health concern is the trans fatty acid content which has a negative impact on coronary heart disease. I am also aware that certain jurisdictions have implemented restrictions on the use of trans fatty acids.  The matter came up for discussion during EU deliberations on an amendment to a draft regulation on nutritional claims this year when Ireland expressed concern that trans fatty acids were not adequately considered. However, the EU Commission opinion is that the levels of consumption of trans fatty acids in Europe are within the maximum levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">Ireland has also made written submissions and has raised the matter at EU labelling meetings on a number of occasions recommending that the fat content of products be clearly labelled. This is in the interests of both public health and providing as much information as possible to the consumer to enable the consumer to make informed food choices. Our position in relation to labelling is that the amount of trans fatty acids should be included in the mandatory nutrition declaration.  Ireland's position on trans fatty acids is determined by public health and food safety considerations and this will continue to be the case.</p>

Children will qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at the start of each academic year.  The application of age range is being interpreted as generously as possible, to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This will mean that, in January 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  Children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2010.  However, children who will qualify for the pre-school year in September 2010 will not benefit from it if their parents choose to send them to primary school at that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">The ECCE scheme will be funded by my Office through the provision of capitation grants paid directly to participating services.

            <p eId="para_1881">Under the Health Act 2004 the Health Service Executive is required to prepare and submit an annual Service Plan to the Minister for approval. The Service Plan must inter alia reflect the policies and objectives of the Minister and the Government.  Significant progress was made in the HSE Service Plan 2009 in terms of incorporating more explicit links between funding, staffing and services and the development of an improved set of activity measures, performance indicators and deliverables in key service areas, including in the mental health area, which are matched with timescales.  The HSE reports monthly to my Department on the performance of the health system against the agreed targets.  My Department is continuing to work with the HSE to further refine and develop appropriate performance measures in mental health in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">Policy for the development of mental health services is outlined in <i>‘A Vision for Change’</i> the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.  The aim is to migrate from traditional institutional based model to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service, where need for hospital admission is greatly reduced, whilst still providing in-patient care when appropriate. In January 2008, the Office for Disability and Mental Health was established and one of its priorities is to drive implementation of ‘<i>A Vision for Change’</i>.  In April 2009,  the HSE adopted an implementation plan for the five year period 2009 — 2013 and shortly intends to appoint a national lead for mental health which will bring a new impetus to the implementation of ‘<i>A Vision for Change’.</i>

            <p eId="para_1886">The Minister announced last week that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will commence on the 27th October 2009.  The application form and information booklet for the scheme are now available to the public and may be obtained from the HSE.  This will enable people to familiarise themselves with the application form and process, gather necessary information and generally prepare themselves so that they are ready to apply when the scheme is introduced.  In addition, the new care representative appointment process has commenced.  This allows people to apply to the Circuit Court for appointment as a care representative where they wish to apply for the Nursing Home Loan on behalf of an applicant with reduced capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">With regard to the list of supports and services that are covered under the scheme, the Act defines "long-term residential care services" as maintenance, health and personal care services.  In the case of public nursing home care, the Minister intends to publish details of the goods and services which constitute "long-term residential care services" provided in public nursing homes and which constitute the total cost of such services in public nursing homes.  She will lay this information before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the commencement of the scheme.  In the case of private nursing home care, the details of the goods and services which constitute "long-term residential care services" will be listed in the approved nursing home agreement between the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the private provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">Finally, I understand the Deputy's reference to the level of the cap to refer to the 15% cap on the principal residence and the recommendation in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes that this be increased to 22.5%.  It is not my intention to increase the level of the cap within the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1896">There is no State system for the registration for people who are blind. However, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland operates a system of registration for people with a visual impairment. If you are registered as a blind person with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland this registration is usually accepted as satisfying the blindness criteria for State schemes such as the Blind Pension, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance. The National Council for the Blind of Ireland provides a range of services to over 14,000 people with a wide range of visual impairments including those who are blind. The National Council for the Blind of Ireland has informed my Department that 453 people with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and a wide range of visual impairment are using their services</p>

As not every individual in Ireland who has a physical, sensory or speech and language disability is availing of, or requiring a specialised health and personal social service, it cannot give a definite number of people with any specific disability. Additionally, participation in the NPSDD is voluntary; the Database may not, therefore, cover a proportion of people living in Ireland who have a physical, sensory or speech and language disability, and who have chosen not to register. The NPSDD cannot therefore, provide any definitive epidemiological statement on the number of people with a particular type of disability. However, the data available is outlined below.</p>

            <p eId="para_1926">Diabetes is a common metabolic condition that affects approximately 1 in 20 people in Ireland. It carries a risk of medical complications, including peripheral arterial disease, which on occasion, requires surgical amputation of the affected limb. In 2006 my Department published its policy "Diabetes: Prevention and a model for Patient Care". In November 2008 the Health Service Executive published the report of its Diabetes Expert Advisory Group to take forward and implement the policy recommendations. This represents a blueprint for the development of services for patients with diabetes over the coming years. It is patient focussed, emphasises prevention and highlights foot care as a critical component of diabetes care.</p>

            <p eId="para_1947">Patient safety has become both a national and international imperative in recent years, with increasing emphasis across the world on patient safety in policy reform, legislative changes and development of standards of care driven by quality improvement initiatives.  I and this government place great importance on the policies and practical reforms we are implementing to ensure patient safety and quality-assured health services.  The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established in January 2007 and reported to me in July 2008.  The Commission's Report —<i>Building a Culture of Patient Safety </i>- was published in August 2008; thus the Commission’s remit was completed and it was not required to remain in situ after that point. </p>
            <p eId="para_1948">Following on from that body of work, the Government accepted the Commission's report earlier this year and supported the immediate establishment of a Steering Group to drive implementation of the Report's 134 recommendations. The Implementation Steering Group (ISG) was set up in June 2009 and is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of my Department, Dr. Tony Holohan.  I expect to receive the ISG's first Quarterly Report on progress to date in the very near future.  The Government also approved the commencement of work on the drawing up of legislation to give effect to the Commission's central recommendation on the licensing of both public and private healthcare providers.  Preparatory work on this has already commenced in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1953">The Crisis Pregnancy Agency was established in October 2001 and is to be integrated with the HSE at the end of this year as part of the Government's programme of rationalisation of State agencies.  Among the Agency's mandates is the provision of services and supports to women experiencing crisis pregnancy with a view to reducing the number of women with crisis pregnancy who opt for abortion.  The Agency supports the delivery of crisis pregnancy and post termination counselling services through service level agreements with 14 providers operating in over 50 locations nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">The Crisis Pregnancy Agency is aware of the existence of a number of agencies which seek to manipulate women by providing a "disingenuous" crisis pregnancy counselling and/or information service.  The Agency is working on a wide range of actions to address this issue.  These actions include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1955">A public awareness campaign which I launched in July 2009 entitled "Don't be manipulated" which highlights the existence of disingenuous agencies and promotes the availability of free, non-judgemental state-funded crisis pregnancy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1956">Continuous promotion through the "Positive Options" campaign of the availability of free, non-judgemental and confidential state-funded crisis pregnancy counselling services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">Redevelopment of the "Positive Options" website to highlight the actions of disingenuous agencies and to give guidance on how to deal with same.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">Prominent advertising of "Positive Options" and consumer tips in the Golden Pages, including the regional directories, under "Pregnancy Testing and Counselling" and "Family Planning" sections.  The use of a common logo for all state funded counselling services in current editions of the Directories.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">Funding of resources which provide clear objective information on the adoption process.  The Agency provides information on adoption in manuals used in the training of <i>bona-fide</i> crisis pregnancy counsellors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">Expansion of crisis pregnancy counselling services nationally by over 50% since the Agency was established in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">Guidance for crisis pregnancy counselling services in responding to third party complaints they may receive about "disingenuous" counselling services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">Standardised training and up-skilling for counsellors in state-funded crisis pregnancy counselling services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals.

In calculating a person's assessable income, the HSE will take certain items of expenditure, termed "allowable deductions" into account.  Part 3B of the application form for the scheme allows applicants to provide details of allowable deductions.  One of the categories of allowable deductions is health expenses to which section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies. This category allows health expenses that have not been recouped fromeither the Revenue Commissioners or a private health insurance company to be taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1997">In late August, I was made aware of two significant Reports regarding child welfare, protection and adoption in Vietnam.  Firstly, the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, with technical assistance from UNICEF in Vietnam, published a Report known as the ‘MoLISA Report'.   The Report found that, inter alia: there are no detailed principles or criteria to guide the assessment in Vietnam of prospective guardians, foster parents or substitute  families for orphans; there is no framework for the systematic, professional assessment of orphans and abandoned children to determine what type of placement would be in their best interest, and to ensure that they are matched with the most appropriate alternative family; there is no clear requirement that decisions about alternative care be based on the child's best interest; there is no clear statement in law that international adoptions shall be used only as a last resort, once all options for placement within the country have been considered; there are no systematic procedures for ensuring that all efforts are made to find a suitable domestic family before consideration of international options; there is no requirement that birth parents be given counselling and be clearly informed of the consequences of adoption prior to giving consent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">The Report contains a series of recommendations including, the need to: reform the institutional care of orphaned and abandoned children in Vietnam; provide counselling to birth parents prior to giving consent to adoption; intensify preparations for accession to the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption; centralise authority to consider and approve inter-country adoptions, and stipulate that international adoptions may be considered only after all other options have been explored and, also, that the child cannot be placed into foster care or with a family or cannot, in any suitable manner, be cared for in Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">In addition to the MoLISA Report, I have recently received, in draft form, the report of an examination of inter-country adoption in Vietnam carried out by the International Social Services (ISS).  The Report was jointly commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and seeks, inter alia, to "identify and address problems in both domestic and inter-country adoption  processes with a view to assisting Vietnam in its preparations to ratify  the Hague Convention".

            <p eId="para_2015">The Health Service Executive (HSE) transferred a defined list of fertility medicines to the High Tech Scheme from the Drug Payment Scheme in March 2009. This was put in place to improve governance arrangements for monitoring usage and prescribing patterns as patients must be authorised in advance by the HSE under the High Tech Scheme.  The HSE advised prescribers in registered fertility clinics that it considered three full cycles of IVF an appropriate benchmark for funding. Some registered clinics already operate such a benchmark to avoid over-stimulation of the ovaries, which can have serious consequences for the patient in question. The HSE advises that no patient has been refused authorisation under the High Tech Scheme to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">There is no legislation in Ireland that deals specifically with the area of Assisted Human Reproduction. A Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction examined the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of this area and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy. The Commission's report was referred by the Government to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">My Department is developing an appropriate regulatory framework which would involve legislation for the area of Assisted Human Reproduction.  The work involves, inter alia, examining the approaches to regulation in other jurisdictions and considering the ethical and legal issues that arise.  It will also take into account the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on this area — when completed — and an expected judgment of the Supreme Court in the RvR (<i>frozen embryos</i>) case. In the meantime, I do not propose to issue guidelines on the matters raised by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2022">The Joint Working Group referred to by the Deputy did not meet on a formal basis. However a number of joint meetings between officials from Ireland and Vietnam were held on an ad hoc basis to support the implementation of the Agreement. Representatives of my Department and/or the Adoption Board met with their Vietnamese counterparts as required to review issues relating to adoptions from Vietnam on foot of the Agreement. Officials from my Department visited Vietnam on at least 5 occasions since the signing of the bilateral agreement in 2003.  I have asked the Adoption Board to provide details of visits made by them to Vietnam in the same period and I will revert to the Deputy when the information becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">During the course of these visits some of the matters discussed included co-operation on technical assistance, staff training, providing assistance to State competent authorities involved in adoption and the care of children as referred to in Article 24 of the Bilateral Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">The issue of humanitarian aid, is referred to in Article 8. 2 of the Bilateral Agreement which states that "when applying for a licence to operate in the state of origin an authorised organisation must submit its non profit plan including humanitarian financial assistance for nurturing institutions in the State of Origin". Article 24 allows for the reviewing and evaluating of this aid by the Joint Working Group however the Irish Government had no role in authorising any amounts payable or which organisation in the sending country received such monies. Governance and accounting issues in relation to humanitarian aid was discussed during more recent meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">The issues discussed at all meetings fed into the thinking and drafting of future bilateral agreements and also informed the deliberations on the intercountry adoption aspects of the Adoption Bill 2009.  Reports have been prepared by officials of my Department on foot of some of these visits but it is not my intention to publish these reports or place them in the Oireachtas library.</p>

The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.  Only adoptions effected before the commencement of the Act can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">Ireland has no bilateral intercountry adoption agreement in place with Russia.  Preliminary work was undertaken on the development of a bilateral agreement with the Russian authorities on intercountry adoption and future discussions in this regard will need to take account of the provisions of the Adoption Bill 2009.  Recent discussions involving my office, the HSE and the Adoption Board have focused on the completion and submission to the Russian authorities of a number of outstanding post-placement reports in respect of children already adopted from Russia.</p>

Since the start of 2009, the number of persons covered by a medical card has increased by 85,998 and the number of persons covered by a GP visit card has increased by 8,077.

            <p eId="para_2067">Based on the monthly statistics supplied by the HSE to my Department in its monthly service plan reports, it is estimated that the year-end figures will be in the region of 1,491,000 medical cards, representing an annual increase of 139,000, or 58,000 more medical cards than estimated in the service plan; and 98,300 GP visit cards, representing an annual increase of 12,754, or 48,800 fewer GP visit cards than estimated in the service plan.  This is primarily due to the downturn in the economy and the associated rise in the live register, which is resulting in more people becoming eligible for a medical card.  To date, the HSE's monthly service plan reports show that the medical card and GP visit card monthly expenditure has been within the overall expenditure projected for the General Medical Services scheme.  My Department and the HSE will continue to monitor this situation as the year progresses.</p>

I am conscious of road safety in relation to learner drivers, in particular that they are in the learning phase of driving and extra caution and supervision is required.  For that reason I reformed the arrangements for licensing of learner drivers in Regulations made in October 2007.  These Regulations replaced the provisional licence with a learner permit and applied consistent rules for all learner drivers in relation to being accompanied by holders of full licences while driving.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">All learner drivers must be now be accompanied by a person who holds a full driving licence for at least two years.  In addition, learner drivers may not undertake a driving test for at least 6 months after gaining a learner permit, so that they have this period of supervised driving experience before taking the test.</p>

            <p eId="para_2147">The National Roads Authority has not taken over responsibility for regional and local roads. They remain the statutory responsibility of the local authorities.  From 1st September last, the National Roads Authority was tasked with undertaking certain functions relating to regional and local road grants on behalf of my Department.  This was done on foot of an agreement negotiated by officials of my Department and the NRA and approved by me and the Board of the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">The new arrangement was concluded on an administrative basis so as not to affect my statutory role or that of the local authorities in any way.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads remains the statutory responsibility of road authorities under section 13 of the Roads Act 1993 and is not affected by the new administrative arrangements.  The NRA is not being given any new statutory powers similar to those it has in relation to national roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">Under section 82 of the Roads Act the Minister for Transport is empowered to pay grants to road authorities and under this power I allocate regional and local road grants to these authorities each year to supplement expenditure from their own resources.  This power is also unaffected by the revised administrative arrangements and I will continue to decide on grants policy and on the grant allocations to each individual road authority.  This decision was taken on grounds of administrative efficiency, particularly in circumstances where there is increasing pressure on staffing and financial resources. It makes sense to use one organisation to administer all road grant payments and to monitor the expenditure of these road grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">The NRA already had very effective systems in place to administer the national road improvement and maintenance programme and it was therefore concluded that the most logical and efficient approach was to use that NRA expertise to administer regional and local road grants as well.  Because there is no change in my statutory power I will continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas as at present and will continue to reply to Parliamentary Questions on regional and local road grants.</p>

            <p eId="para_2162">I refer to the reply to Questions Nos 51 and 30 of 9th July 2009.  While there are over one hundred individual actions proposed under Ireland's first National Cycle Policy Framework, the key objectives are to create a culture of cycling in Ireland and to achieve a 10% share of the travel market for cycling by 2020.  I have already commenced delivery of actions under the NCPF, including support for exemplary cycling projects and awareness-raising initiatives including last June's National Bike Week which was supported by a dedicated website.  An Taisce's Green-Schools Travel programme, which is supported by my Department through the Dublin Transportation Office, is a further key awareness-raising and cycle training initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">The wide-ranging nature of the individual interventions in the National Cycle Policy Framework, their interlinkage with actions proposed under the Smarter Travel policy, and the challenges that face us in terms of availability of resources means that it would not be productive, at this stage, to assign precise deadlines to each action.  In light of this, it is not reasonable to attempt to project overall costs over the plan period in any meaningful way — rather the focus must be on making progress within existing resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">I am satisfied that a good start has been made to implementing both Smarter Travel and the National Cycle Policy Framework and I remain convinced that the key objectives of both can be delivered by 2020.

            <p eId="para_2184">A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.  All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further supporting documentation was requested from the person in question on 26 May, 2009.  This letter was re-issued on 7 September, 2009 and to date we have not had a response from the applicant.  On receipt of the requested documentation further processing of the application will continue.  The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

In addition, more recently the exercise yards at the prison have been fitted with netting specially designed to prevent airborne articles being propelled into restricted areas.

The strength of Leixlip Garda Station on 31st August 2006, at which time it was part of the DMR West Division, was 24 Gardaí (all ranks).

Garda Management are aided in this by a distribution model known as the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (G.E.R.M.).  The Commissioner advises me that the GERM model indicates the most effective means to distribute Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account many different policing variables including socio-economic factors, census information, crime trends and the minimum establishment required for each district.  The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by these factors and the policing requirements of each individual Division</p>

One of its main recommendations was that an emergency alert system for missing children, similar to the Amber Alert system in place in other countries, should be established.  I gave the go ahead for the implementation of this recommendation, and it is being advanced by An Garda Síochána.  As the Inspectorate's report recognises, this is a challenging task which requires the support of a range of government agencies, NGOs and private sector representatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_2211">The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004, is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry.  The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department and the administration of the Authority is vested in its Board Membership.  My Department is therefore not involved in the day to day running of the Authority and the processing of licence applications is a matter solely for the Authority.  I am however advised by the Authority that as at 9 October 2009, approximately 770 contractors have received licences from the Private Security Authority to provide services in the private security industry.  In addition, over 25,650 individual licences, entitling the holder to operate as an employee in the security industry, have also been issued.</p>

All applicants for individual licences also go through the vetting process.

The Bill has been developed against a background of extensive consultations by the Law Reform Commission during the preparation of its Consultation Paper and Final Report on the subject.  Work is continuing in my Department on preparing necessary amendments to the Bill and, as part of that exercise, my Department continues to have contact with many groups, including groups representing owners of residential units in multi-unit developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_2220">The Deputy will be aware that when granting development consent for the Thornton prison project, the Oireachtas decided to increase the planted zone in order to mitigate the visual and aural impact of the development.  The initial landscape contract for the Thornton Hall site comprised the planting of approximately 3,700 linear metres of the boundary of the site with trees and shrubs within a 10 metre wide belt, fencing the boundary planted zone as well as the aftercare/maintenance of the planting zone.  Such work included, control of weeds and grass growth, adjustments/maintenance of fencing, tree staking, and replacement of any dead or failed plants.  The cost of this aftercare/maintenance work was approximately €30,000 excluding VAT and was incurred over the period 2006 to end 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2221">A new contract was recently awarded following a tender competition to a landscape company to undertake the installation of over 2,200 woodland plants at the Thornton Hall site as well as the maintenance of the planted zone at a total cost of €15,300 excluding VAT.  This includes the estimated cost of the additional planting of €3,500.  It is anticipated that the additional planting work will commence next month.  The maintenance element of the contract is estimated at approximately €11,800 and provides for the strimming of planted areas, follow up with weed control measures, remove all tree stakes and tree ties, adjust/repair the protective fences.  These works will provide effective maintenance of the planted areas until Spring 2010.  The requirement for further maintenance work will be reviewed at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">Consideration is currently being given to undertaking further additional planting.  This work is expected to commence later this year and continue into 2010.  It is not possible at this time to disclose the cost of this work for procurement reasons as it will be the subject of a tender competition.  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service is satisfied that undertaking the boundary planting scheme, which commenced in 2005, will contribute very significantly to reducing the visual and aural impact of the development and will benefit the local environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2228">The scheme referred to by the Deputy relates to All non-EEA persons who have held employment permits for 5 years or more consecutively and have been working lawfully during that time. If the person in question satisfies this requirement:</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">He will be issued a Stamp 4 immigration permission signifying the right to be present in the State and to be employed without an employment permit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">This permission will run for one year. It may be renewed annually but this will depend on whether the holder is in employment or, if redundant, is making efforts to seek employment and has not become an undue burden on the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">The holder of this permission will be free to work in any employment and will no longer be limited to the current employer. Should they subsequently be made redundant they are free to seek other employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">The Stamp 4 permission in these cases cannot be construed as conferring any other rights or entitlements. It is not long term residence and it cannot be seen as any guarantee of permanent status.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">The Stamp 4 permission does not include a right of self-employment or business permission (such permission is, however, given to those who secure long term residence).</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">The concession is being made irrespective of whether the person is currently an applicant for long term residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">To avail of this concession the applicant must be able to demonstrate via P60 forms that they have been in employment and have paid their taxes as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">An application for long term residency from the person concerned was received in my Department on 24 November 2008.  Officials in the long term residency section of my Department inform me that files received in February 2008 are currently being processed.  It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in the coming months.  The person in question will be contacted as soon as a decision is reached on their application.</p>

            <p eId="para_2251">I wish to advise the Deputy that a three month delay in processing prison officers pension entitlement is the exception rather than the rule.  The current average turnaround period is less than 6 weeks.   I must, however, point out that some delay is inevitable given that the process cannot begin until the officer completes his/her last day of service and a final pay cheque issues.  This is due to the fact that information regarding, for example, allowances payable, premium payments due, rostered/actual attendance, cannot be ascertained factually until the officer has officially departed.  Furthermore, the processing of the pension involves input from both my Department and the Department of Finance before final details issue to the Paymaster General's office for payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2252">I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the Human Resources Directorate of the Irish Prison Service recently examined the pension calculation process with a view to ensuring a more efficient service.

            <p eId="para_2266">A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in May 2008.  All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.<b/>

Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person concerned was informed, by letter dated 19th February 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), to be exercised within 15 working days. Namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">This communication also advised the person concerned of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations.  Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused.  The person concerned and her legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 31 July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State.  On 20 August 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to leave the State by 13 September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">The legal representative of the person concerned lodged representations on 21st August 2009 seeking re-consideration of the refusal of permission to remain in the State and these were considered under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999, (as amended).  This application was refused and the Deportation Order was affirmed.  The person concerned and her legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 14 September 2009.  The person concerned should present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 13 October 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.<b>  </b>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

The total cost of these allowances in 2008 and 2009 (to 30 September) was €20.7m and €15.22m respectively.  The regulations governing these arrangements have been sanctioned by the Department of Finance.

            <p eId="para_2390">In 2008, Ireland spent €920 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA). This represented approximately 0.59 % of our Gross National Product (GNP).  For 2009 the total budget for ODA is expected to reach €696 million. Based on current projections this will represent at least 0.48% of GNP. This means that Ireland will remain one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">As the Deputy is aware the Government has established a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012. We do recognise that achieving this target will be a challenge in the current economic circumstances. During the estimates process for 2010 which is currently underway, the Government will make a comprehensive assessment of our capacity to achieve this target.  It must be recognised that there are many competing demands for scarce resources. Our aim is to protect the aid programme to the maximum extent achievable within the context of the current difficult fiscal environment. I would point out that Ireland's aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the best in the world. Our peers in the OECD have described it as "cutting edge". I can assure the Deputy that this quality will be maintained while we continue to ensure maximum value for taxpayers' money in our aid programme.</p>

I impressed upon the Sudanese Government the need to persuade the kidnappers to free Sharon and Hilda and to bring this unacceptable situation to a swift and peaceful end.  More recently, on the 23rd of September, during my visit to New York, I took the opportunity to meet with the Sudanese Government at a senior level and also asked for the assistance of the US Government to use whatever influence it can on the Khartoum authorities to secure the release of the two women.</p>

            <p eId="para_2406">The Department spent a total of €114,399 on non core pay, excluding overtime, in 2008. To date in 2009, the corresponding expenditure is €117, 060. The reason for the increase this year is due to the fact that a number of officers in receipt of higher duty allowances received arrears to the value of €24,600 under the terms of Department of Finance Circular 38/2007. A total of €162,708 was spent on overtime in 2008 and to date in 2009 expenditure is €94,301.  Payment of non core pay including overtime in the agencies under the aegis of the Department is a day to day matter for those bodies.</p>

Until these works have been completed and the appropriate planning approvals received, I am advised that houseboats cannot be accommodated in Grand Canal Dock.</p>

            <p eId="para_2792">The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides a wide range of second chance education opportunities for unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities. The Department's objective in this area is to raise educational and skills levels among the long term unemployed, in order to assist them to meet the requirements of the modern labour market. The Department's back to education programme was introduced to provide a comprehensive range of options from basic courses of education, training or development through to third level courses of study from which an unemployed person can choose, or be directed to, the course most appropriate for their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">The part-time education option (PTEO) under the back to education programme was introduced to enable unemployed people to attend part-time courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis. Unlike the other educational opportunity schemes there are no specific eligibility criteria for availing of this option. A person may be of any age and may be unemployed for any length of time before commencing a part-time course of education. Part-time day/evening/early morning courses, distance education or part-time courses under the back to education initiative (BTEI) may be approved under the part-time education option (PTEO). Approval to undertake a course must be obtained in advance from the local social welfare office. The scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the changes in the economic climate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2880">Rent Supplement is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  It is a requirement of the rent supplement scheme that a person has been assessed as eligible for and in need of social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where the claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside), unless the person has been residing in the private rented sector or in accommodation for homeless people (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days, within the preceding 12 months of the date of the claim for rent supplement.</p>

This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2884">An application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received by the Department on 29 June 2009.

A letter issued to the person in question on 17 August 2009 where she was advised of the decision to refuse Domiciliary Care Allowance. In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2945">I propose to take Questions Nos. 316, 317, 319 and 324 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2946">Rent supplement is payable to people who are unable to meet the cost of renting private accommodation. The supplement is intended as a short-term income support to eligible tenants whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs. There are currently almost 91,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 23% since the end of December 2008.  The following Table shows the number of people in receipt of rent supplement for the past 5 years and expenditure on the scheme in that time. Provision has been made for expenditure of €490.4m in 2009, which is €50.7m more than the 2008 outturn on the scheme. There is no data available on the number of people who may be eligible for rent supplement but who have not claimed the supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2947">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The administration cost of the SWA scheme was €63.1m in 2008 and provision has been made for expenditure of €64.6m in 2009. There is no breakdown available to show the cost of administering the various components of the supplementary allowance scheme such as rent supplement.  Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €24, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2948">The assessment for the existing rent supplement provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Where a person, working up to 30 hours per week, has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. A person accepted as having a long term housing need under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) may engage in full time employment and still qualify for rent supplement, subject to standard means assessment rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_2949">In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods. Over 32,600 people are getting a supplement for 18 months or more. For this reason, the rent supplement scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2950">The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DoEHLG) indicate that to date, local authorities have transferred 22,400 people from rent supplement to RAS or social housing since 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2951">The fact that almost 91,000 people are receiving rent supplement indicates that the scheme is meeting need to a significant extent. However, the rent supplement scheme, including the means testing criteria, will be kept under review. The Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support and that local authorities are supported in providing a wide range of social housing supports for those with a long-term housing need.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3037">I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 to 322, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3038">There are currently almost 91,000 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 52% since the end of 2007. Over half of these recipients have been in payment for more than one year while over 32,000 (35%) have been in payment for 18 months or more.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, RAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3039">Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicate that to date, local authorities have transferred almost 12,000 rent supplement cases to RAS units. In addition, housing authorities have also transferred over 10,400 recipients to other social housing options, a total of over 22,400 transfers since 2005. Almost 7,000 recipients were transferred in 2008.  While progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected, the pace of delivery has improved significantly and in 2009 a target has been set of transferring an additional 7,000 households from rent supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3040">In addition to this official target, due to the numbers of unsold affordable stock around the country, an opportunity has been created to make use of some of these properties for RAS and it is expected that additional transfers may be possible in 2009, above that provided for by the 2009 target. The position regarding the availability of property is monitored on an ongoing basis, given the current market condition, and there may be an opportunity to achieve further transfers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3041">The changes made in Budget 2009 to better align the minimum weekly contribution required from tenants under the rent supplement scheme with that under RAS should also encourage more people to take up RAS offers.  The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</p>

        <b>Deputy Olwyn Enright</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the amount lost in rent supplement deposits per year for the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [35266/09]

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3043">Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost, such as a payment of a rent deposit, which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">There is no automatic entitlement to this payment and each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case taking account of the nature and extent of the need. Such payments are confined to occurrences which the Executive considers to be unexpected, unforeseen or exceptional. In general, such payments are made to the tenant and only paid occasionally to the landlord where the tenant requests that the payment be made direct to the landlord.  The tabular statement below shows the number of exceptional needs payments made in respect of rent deposits in each year from 2004 to date, the average cost of such payments and total expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3045">If the landlord or tenant terminates the tenancy the tenant can use the returned deposit to secure a new tenancy. If a tenant has a legitimate grievance in relation to the refund of a rent deposit which they have paid to their landlord, they may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process.  Every effort is made to ensure that payment of rent deposit is only made once in an individual case by checking computer systems to identify if any previous deposit had been paid. In general, multiple rent deposits are not paid to the same person. In these circumstances, there is no evidence to indicate that rent deposits have been lost to any significant degree in the past five years.</p>

        <b>Deputy Seán Connick</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that many persons who have previously attended third level education and who are in long-term receipt of social welfare payments are unable to receive State support to allow them to return to college; her proposals to assist persons in this position; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3084">I understand the Deputy is referring to the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme. Since its introduction, the underlying objective of the scheme has been to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market. It is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on certain social welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so. The scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3085">Under the back to education scheme an applicant can pursue a second or third level course up to and including a Higher Diploma in any discipline and a Graduate Diploma in Education which add significantly to a person's employability. A person who holds an equivalent or higher qualification will not be eligible for the scheme.  The part-time education option of the back to education programme enables unemployed people to attend part-time courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis.  There are a number of financial assistance schemes available to help students to progress through further and higher education. The website <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> provides information on course fees and details on eligibility requirements for free fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_3086">The focus of the back to education allowance scheme is on providing assistance to the highest possible number of those in greatest need in terms of meeting the requirements of a modern labour market. People in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects. The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstance in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_3105">In order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the live register and the continuing unprecedented contraction in employment opportunities, it was decided in the context of the last supplementary budget to refocus resources on the enterprise strand of the back to work allowance which supports people into self employment.  These changes significantly strengthen the support for social welfare customers wishing to move to self employment.  In this context the employee strand of the back to work allowance has been closed to new applicants from 1 May 2009.  Persons who qualified for the back to work employee strand prior to this date will continue to be paid their entitlements.  It is not intended to replace this scheme at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_3106">As at the beginning of July 2009, 0.34% of disability welfare payment recipients were availing of the employee strand of the back to work allowance.  This indicates a low uptake of the scheme by people in receipt of disability welfare payments.  While the wage subsidy scheme administered by FÁS provides an incentive to employers to employ people with disabilities it was considered that access to the back to work allowance had not significantly incentivised or promoted participant uptake of employment to any considerable degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_3107">The Department is committed to supporting people with disabilities into and in employment.  The current model of an earnings disregard for rehabilitative employment is instrumental in incentivising people in receipt of Disability Allowance to take up employment or self-employment that is considered rehabilitative in nature.  A person may also retain any secondary benefits they were in receipt of prior to taking up employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3108">In January 2008, the Department obtained approval under the European Social Fund, Human Capital Investment Operational Programme 2007-2013 for a cross agency programme to develop and assess new approaches to promoting participation in the economy on the part of people with disabilities.  The high level objective of this interagency project is to develop and test a comprehensive employment strategy based on individual case management of people on illness/disability welfare payments that will have the capacity to increase their rate of employment.  The project has commenced in the BMW region, in Mullingar, Co. Westmeath.  It is envisaged that the strategy, when developed and tested, will form the basis of a working model for activation of people on illness/disability welfare payments which can be rolled out on a county wide basis.  In the above context it is not considered appropriate to reinstate the back to work allowance for people in receipt of disability welfare payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_3116">I propose to take Questions Nos. 341 and 342 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3117">The person concerned exhausted his entitlement to Illness Benefit on 22 June 2009.  He was notified by letter that, in order to re-qualify for Illness Benefit, he would need 13 additional weeks of insurable employment from the date his benefit stopped.  He was also advised that if he was not able to meet his needs that he may be entitled to Supplementary Welfare Allowance or Disability Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3118">On 3 June 2009, an application from the person concerned was approved for an exemption (permission to work part-time) under the conditions for receipt of Illness Benefit.  Exemptions are granted for rehabilitative and occupational therapy purposes.  They allow people in receipt of Illness Benefit to engage in part-time work or training and retain their Illness Benefit payment with the objective of enabling them to return to the workplace on a full-time basis.  Disability Allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.</p>
            <p eId="para_3119">The person concerned applied for Disability Allowance on 9 July 2009.  Following a medical examination by a Medical Assessor and a means investigation by a Social Welfare Inspector he was awarded Disability Allowance on 1 October 2009 at the maximum weekly rate of €204.30.  His first payment will be in his bank account on 21 October, 2009.  While this claim was initially awarded from 15 July 2009 it is now being back-dated to 23 June 2009 (the day after his Illness Benefit stopped) and arrears due from then, less overlapping payments of Supplementary Welfare Allowance which he received in the meantime, will issue directly by cheque to the person concerned soon after he receives his first Disability Allowance payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3120">As the person concerned had been granted permission to engage in rehabilitative type work under the Illness Benefit scheme this permission will continue to apply under the Disability Allowance scheme.  Earnings up to €120 per week from rehabilitative type work are not taken into account in assessing means for Disability Allowance purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3121">As it now appears that the person concerned may have the necessary 13 additional weeks of insurable employment to re-qualify for Illness Benefit it is open to him to advise the Department if he wishes to claim Illness Benefit instead of Disability Allowance.  However, while the rate of payment for both schemes is the same, persons in receipt of Disability Allowance are entitled to a Free Travel pass while those in receipt of Illness Benefit are not so entitled.</p>

            <p eId="para_3154">Family income supplement (FIS) is designed to provide income for employees, on low earnings, with families.  This preserves the incentive to move from welfare to (or remain in) employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3155">To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.  FIS is then calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the net income of the person(s) raising the children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3156">Once the level of FIS payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that level for a period of 52 weeks provided that the person remains in employment. The rate of payment can be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.  Improvements in recent years to FIS include the change of assessment from a gross income to a net income basis, the increase to €20 per week in the minimum payment and the refocusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.  The working hours requirement to qualify for FIS i.e. a minimum of 19 hours per week/ 38 hours per fortnight already assumes a reduction in hours compared to the standard working week. Any further changes to the hours worked could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_3167">The person concerned submitted applications for jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance on 12 February 2009.  The jobseeker's benefit claim was closed as she failed to submit the necessary documentation in support of her claim.  Unfortunately due to an administrative oversight which is regretted, no decision was made on her jobseeker's allowance until 9 October 2009.  During the intervening period she had been paid supplementary welfare allowance.  Jobseeker's allowance was awarded at full rate with effect from 12 February including an increase for a qualified adult and one qualified child.  The first payment will be available for collection at her nominated post office on 14 October 2009.  Arrears will be calculated and included with her payment for the following week.</p>

            <p eId="para_3169">With effect from 01 October 2009, the United Nations Mission in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic (MINURCAT) has discontinued direct provisioning of bottled drinking water to all Troop Contributing Countries (TCC) operating water treatment plants in theatre.  Ireland presently operates three (3) such plants, which provide both potable and sanitary water for personnel use at Goz Beida.  The treatment plants provide potable water, which has been made available from ground extraction through a water purification system (which meets current international standards) and is suitable and fit for human consumption.  Nonetheless, Ireland is investigating the issue with MINURCAT of continuing with direct provisioning of bottled drinking water to the Irish contingent, due to issues which may potentially arise in the future e.g. the likely impact on local aquifers of further UN construction works and increased staff occupancy at Goz Beida.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_3192">The information that the Deputy has requested is provided in the tables attached as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_3193">Table 1: shows the number of Reserve Defence Force (RDF) personnel who undertook paid training, the number recruited and the number paid a gratuity in each year from 2003 to 2 October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3194">Table 2: shows the cost of the RDF, as charged to Subhead D of the Defence Vote for each year from 2003 to 30 September 2009.  This subhead includes payments for RDF training, gratuities, allowances and also includes grants paid into unit funds. The table also shows other costs relating to the RDF, as charged to Subheads C, P and R of the Defence Vote, for each period (Subhead R to 31 August 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_3195">As the RDF is an integral part of the Defence Forces a range of costs, other than those shown at Table 2, are spread across other Subheads of the Defence Vote.  These costs, which include Petrol, Transport, Rations etc, are not currently disaggregated for the RDF.</p>
            <p eId="para_3196">The budgetary provision for paid training in 2009 is €4.963 million.  This will provide for approximately 60,000 paid training man-days and is sufficient to ensure that all current members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve are afforded the opportunity to avail of paid training this year.  I have been informed by the military authorities that it is anticipated that the provision for 2009 will be utilised in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_3197">In the context of the Government Decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the RDF had been suspended.  Following a review and examination of RDF personnel numbers and budget, I was satisfied that there would be sufficient provision to allow for paid training for existing members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve this year.  Accordingly, I approved the commencement of limited recruitment to fill vacancies which may arise due to existing Army Reserve or Naval Service Reserve members resigning or being discharged during 2009, in the normal manner.  This is subject to the overall strength figure that existed at 1 January 2009 (7,671) not being exceeded and is to be reviewed periodically.</p>
            <p eId="para_3198">The terms and conditions for receipt of gratuities changed for 2008.  In addition to the phased increase in gratuities linked to specified training levels with a minimum aggregate of seven days paid training and the completion of specified voluntary training, there is a requirement for members to have a minimum of one year's service prior to being eligible for receipt of a gratuity.  The improved rates and the conditions for award of gratuities were sanctioned by the Department of Finance. The Reserve Defence Force Representative Association was consulted by my Department when the gratuity structure was being revised and the changes had their broad agreement and support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3199">The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan has provided the framework for the development of the Reserve over recent years.  Revised organisation structures came into effect in October 2005 and the Reserve has been re-organised along similar lines to the PDF.  In line with the plan, new equipment, clothing and opportunities for improved training have been delivered.  As the Plan is reaching its conclusion, there is a requirement to critically examine the progress that has been made to date and to consider options for the future development of the Reserve.  This will be informed by the valuable lessons learned from the implementation process.  In addition, the RDF was selected for review as part of the 2009-2011 phase of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review initiative and this Review is scheduled to commence in the near future. It is anticipated that this review, together with the general budgetary situation, will also assist in informing decisions regarding the future development of the Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_3200">Planned expenditure levels for my Department will be considered as part of the budgetary and estimates process for 2010. This includes consideration of the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_3286">The Government decision of December 2003 in relation to decentralisation, provides for the transfer of my Department's Dublin-based Civil Service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, County Kildare  and for the decentralisation of the Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh. The number of posts to be relocated to Newbridge is approximately 200 civil service and 55 military.<b/>Construction and fitting-out of new accommodation at Station Road, Newbridge is being handled by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  The building is under construction and is expected to be available for occupation early in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3287">In relation to DFHQ, a further 335 military posts together with 78 support staff will decentralise to the new Defence Forces Headquarters building in the Curragh Camp.  Procurement of the new building is being handled by the OPW.  A State owned site has been identified in the Curragh and planning permission has been granted by Kildare County Council. I understand that the OPW has requested expressions of interest from contractors and that these have been evaluated and a tender list drawn up.  The question of proceeding to the next stage of the project (invitation of tenders) is dependant on the necessary funding for the project being available to the OPW.  This will be decided as part of the upcoming Estimates and budgetary process.</p>

The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 is premised on a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge,  but exempts certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence.  A person who owns a property in this country which is not his or her main residence is liable for the charge unless otherwise exempt, regardless of which country he or she normally resides in.</p>

            <p eId="para_3545">**Jan-Aug 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3546">The number of households transferring from rent supplement has increased year on year since RAS began.  Indeed, in 2008, the scheme exceeded its target number of transfers by 36% or 1,800 households.  Figures to the end of August 2009 would indicate that the scheme is on course to deliver on its target of 7,000 new transfers, with almost 4,500 households transferred or 65% of the annual target met.</p>
            <p eId="para_3547">In terms of the funding arrangements for the scheme, following agreement between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to the target level of transfers each year, the requisite funding to support the scheme is assigned to my Department's Vote.  In recognition of the significant transfers that were already achieved in the first four years of the scheme, and the most ambitious annual transfer target to date, some €90 million was provided to support the scheme in 2009.  This represents a significant increase (70.6%) on the previous year's budget.  While the total expended on the scheme to date is some €145 million, the vast majority of this funding directly provides for the accommodation costs of existing and new transfers to the scheme, and a small proportion is provided to support local authorities in their ongoing operation/administration of the scheme.  To date, approximately €6 million, out of the €145 million spent to date, has been provided to local authorities for this purpose, or just 4% of the overall funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3548">In terms of generating savings from the transfer of Rent Supplement recipients to RAS, the experience to date indicates that while some savings are being generated for particular types of accommodation in certain areas, these savings vary from case to case, and are dependent on the individual circumstances of the tenant, and the standard of their accommodation.  One of the main objectives for the RAS is to improve the living conditions and standards of accommodation for recipients and, to date, some 4,163 new units of accommodation (i.e. not currently in use for Rent Supplement purposes) have been sourced by authorities, which are generally of a higher standard than the existing Rent Supplement accommodation occupied by the households concerned.  In that context, it is considered that the scheme is delivering value for money, as well as meeting an important social policy goal of delivering better accommodation to vulnerable households.</p>
            <p eId="para_3549">Already, my Department has supported a number of external reviews of RAS undertaken by the Centre for Housing Research, as well as undertaking an Interim Value for Money and Policy Review of the scheme.  In line with the Department of Finance guidelines on the latter, the completed review has recently been the subject of an external evaluation and will be published shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3562">The Government has decided to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on all non-principal private residences.  The charge is payable by the owners of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and any other residential property that is not the owner's sole or main residence.  While detailed guidance has been provided to local authorities for the purpose of applying the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, covering, <i>inter alia, </i>the terms and definitions used in the Act and their broad application, interpretation and implementation of the legislation is a matter for the local authorities in the first instance.  As this Act is new legislation, in operation only since July 2009, I have no plans to propose any amendments at this present time.</p>

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered on the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commission of Valuation.  The determination of the annual rate on valuation, which is applied to property valuations to calculate rates, is a decision taken locally by the elected members of a local authority in their annual budget.  With regard to the application of rates to child care facilities, local authorities levy rates on commercial establishments.  Where child care provision is within a community facility, operating in a non-profit capacity, commercial rates do not generally apply.</p>

My Department has approved a budget of €9.197 million for the scheme.  I gave Mayo County Council approval in June 2009 to place the contract for the Design/Build element of the Wastewater Treatment Plant with its recommended contractor at a cost of €2.677 million.  Further progress on this element is a matter for the County Council.  My Department expects to finalise its examination of the Council's Water Services Pricing Policy Report, which will determine the percentage of costs to be covered by the Department, shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3603">Local authorities were asked in July 2009 to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009.  These assessments will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme, which it is anticipated will be published in early 2010.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities have been asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_3604">The Department is awaiting the finalisation of this process in order to determine the priority attached to the collection network component of this scheme, which is not yet approved to go to construction.  My Department has received a request from Mayo County Council for approval to re-tender this contract as the successful tenderer under the previous procurement process withdrew before signature of the contract.  This request will be considered on receipt of Mayo County Council's assessment of needs.</p>

The process has included discussions with a number of organisations, bodies, public agencies and interests active in the area.  The draft Bill proposes to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the Working Group that had been established to review the management of dog breeding establishments.  The Group recommended that a dog breeding establishment be defined as ‘a premises containing more than 5 female dogs, aged over 4 months, with breeding potential'.  The draft Bill proposes that dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, that they pay a registration fee and that they meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards, together with some associated requirements.</p>

It is solely a matter for local authorities to assess housing applicants, independently of my Department, taking into account factors such as the condition and affordability of existing accommodation, medical and compassionate grounds, etc.  The authorities then prioritise the needs of approved applicants.  However, my Department has made enquiries with Clare County Council, and the Council has confirmed that it is aware of the circumstances surrounding this particular case and the family's application for appropriate social housing is being considered.</p>

Issues such as payment by instalment could be examined in this context.  However, regard would have to be had to any increased administrative and financial controls/costs, bank charges, uncertainty as to payment of motor tax and subsequent problems for enforcement of non-payment and retrieval of motor tax discs.  In addition, changes of vehicle ownership, around 1 million annually, undertaken during an instalment period could also present major problems.</p>

The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 is premised on a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge,  but exempts certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence.

            <p eId="para_3760">The primary purpose of Circular SHIP 2009/01 is to ensure that construction related professional services required under the Social Housing Investment Programme are provided in an efficient and effective manner.  The circular does not preclude private sector involvement in the provision of such services and I do not believe it will result in adverse effects for regeneration projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3761">The circular provides that where construction-related professional services are available in-house or on a shared service basis, local authorities should undertake the work from within their own resources.  Where a local authority does not have the necessary expertise available to it in this way, the circular provides that it should in the first instance engage with the National Building Agency (NBA), who may have such expertise available itself or will be in a position to procure it on the local authority's behalf from the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3762">In so far as the potential role of the NBA is concerned, this Agency has built up a level of expertise in public sector work and has traditionally provided a range of services to housing authorities including planning, design and management services for projects.  It is not expected that the overall scale of this involvement will increase; what is envisaged is that the NBA will take on additional responsibilities in the area of public procurement where it will commission private sector professional services, as required, on behalf of local authorities.  It is considered that this will enhance the approach to procurement, through the NBA's further development of its expertise in this area, and assist local authorities in complying with procurement requirements and in the overall efficient delivery of the social housing programme.  Over time, it is anticipated that the NBA will establish frameworks of private sector consultants on a regional basis, which will increase purchasing power and reduce administrative costs for all local authorities, while availing of the expertise available in the private sector in a cost effective manner.</p>

Earlier this year, following an extensive consultation process, the General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was prepared in my Department and approved by the Government. The Noise Nuisance Bill is included in Section A of the Government Legislation Programme published on 16 September, 2009.  The Bill will include provision for the introduction of secondary legislation for the purposes of the prevention, management, limitation, reduction or abatement of any noise which is likely to give rise to a nuisance or disamenity, constitute a danger to health, or damage to property.</p>
            <p eId="para_3768">While there are already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, it is my aim that the new legislation will take a more integrated approach to noise pollution, including through codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations. There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of how noise nuisance can be addressed and to strengthen existing local authority powers, including through a system of fixed payment notices in relation to noise nuisance offences.  The Bill will also extend to An Garda Síochána some of the more appropriate improved powers of the local authority authorised officers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3783">In accordance with Section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997, the preparation of a draft Planning Scheme is a matter for the Authority.  The legislation requires that a scheme detail how it is envisaged that the area covered by the scheme is to be developed, including policies in relation to land use, distribution and location of development, overall design, transportation, the development of amenities and conservation.   The draft scheme for Poolbeg has completed a public consultation process and I understand that the Authority is currently examining more than 100 submissions received. The Authority expects to submit the planning scheme to my Department before the end of the year.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3802">There are currently in excess of 1,400 megawatts (MWS) of renewable powered electricity generating plants accessing the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  There are 92 windfarms connected with a combined capacity in excess of 1,000 MWs compared to hydro-power with 240 MWs approximately connected and a lesser volume of biomass powered plant connected.</p>
            <p eId="para_3803">Based on current technology trends, the dominance of the wind-powered category to date is expected to continue out to 2020 at least.  The amount of renewable-powered plant connected and accessing the electricity grid is increasing steadily from year to year.  It is estimated the available plants will contribute 12.2% of all electricity consumed in 2009, compared to 4.4% in 2003.  Under European Directive 2001/77/EC, Ireland was set a target of 13.2% for renewable electricity to be achieved by 2010.  Ireland is on track to exceed this target and is expected to meet a national target of 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3804">There are a further 1400 MWs, approximately, of capacity in additional renewable projects which have received connection offers, which have been accepted into the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) and are in the process of gaining grid access.  It is estimated that less than 300 MWs of this additional capacity is required to deliver or exceed the Government target to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to 15% of all electricity consumed by 2010.  Under the new European renewable energy directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland's target is for 16% of all energy (to include electricity, heating and transport) to be from renewable energy by 2020.  The Government's national target of 40% of electricity to be from renewable sources by 2020 will play a significant role towards contributing to our overall 2020 target.</p>
            <p eId="para_3805">In December 2008, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) issued a decision which requires EirGrid and ESB Networks to provide connection offers for an additional 3,900 MWs of new renewable capacity to ensure the 2020 target can be achieved.  Connection offers are expected to issue between late 2009 and mid 2011.  This additional level of capacity, taken together with the capacity already built and the capacity that already has connection offers, is capable of meeting our 40% 2020 electricity target which EirGrid and the CER equate to an overall capacity of 5,800 MW of renewable capacity.  Figures from CER indicate that there are in the region of 7,000 MW of further applications for grid connection.  There is currently no breakdown of the technologies in this latter group available.</p>

ComReg is independent in the exercise of its functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3811">Experience in other countries suggests that LLU is a key stimulant of broadband take up.  There are just over 23,000 lines unbundled in Ireland.  ComReg believes that the current suite of LLU products is fit for purpose and meets the needs of alternative operators.  However, to date the full potential of LLU has not been realised in Ireland.  The key issue appears to be pricing.  ComReg have made some pricing decisions recently which, it expects, will facilitate greater competition in the LLU market.</p>

The developers of the Corrib Gas Field, Shell E&amp;P Ireland Ltd, have stated their expectation that first gas will be available in the first quarter of 2011.  Completion of the development works by the developers is the principal factor that will ultimately determine the date for first gas.

            <p eId="para_3816">The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) continues to develop and grow the Digital Hub.  The number of companies and employees based in the Hub has remained buoyant, with continued demand for additional space for digital media companies.  There are now 840 full-time employees working in 97 companies located in the Digital Hub.  A further 500 employees approximately are engaged on a part-time basis by Hub companies.  The work of these companies encompasses computer gaming, animation, on-line bookings, internet security, website development, mobile technologies, broadcasting, design and internet services.  Such highly skilled knowledge economy companies are key to maintaining and developing economic success.</p>
            <p eId="para_3817">The DHDA has been successful in developing and promoting the identity and brand of the Hub.  Late last year, GOA Games Services, a subsidiary of France Telecom, which already employs 200 people in the Digital Hub, announced an expansion to 400 employees in the next 12 months.  Gala Games, a Japanese employer also located in the Hub, recently announced 50 new jobs.  Havok, an Irish world leader in computer graphics technologies, was recognised with an Emmy Award in the United States last year.  It is also notable that two Digital Hub companies, Lincor and Zamano, took first and second place in the Deloitte Fast 50 rankings of Ireland's fastest growing enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_3818">The DHDA also has remits relating to education, community and urban regeneration.  The DHDA delivers a very successful learning programme, which provides state-of-the-art digital media education to schools and the wider community in Dublin's south-west inner city, with a view to improving learning, employment and leisure opportunities for local residents.  The programme is very successful with over 3,300 participants in 2008.  To date, in excess of 10,000 individuals have participated in these programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3819">The growing demand for commercial property for digital media companies at the Digital Hub is further evidence of success.  The DHDA has leased office space to meet the requirements of its tenant companies and has reached the point where all of its own available space has been occupied — approximately 80,000 square feet in State ownership by the DHDA or OPW.  A further 80,000 square feet is occupied by Digital Hub tenants under interim lease arrangements with third parties.  An additional 20,000 square feet is already under construction and will be delivered by April 2010 through redevelopment of another State owned building in partnership with OPW.  Proposals for the development of further office space on the site of the Digital Hub will be reviewed in light of the impact of the economic downturn on property development in general.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3826">The Deputy will be aware that following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a national Eel Management Plan (EMP) for implementation this year. Ireland's plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3827">The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken, based on the best management and scientific advice available, along with other conservation measures to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible.  The prospects for success rely on EU Member States adopting a similar conservative approach.  The by-laws giving effect to this decision (Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition on Issue of Licences) Bye-law No. 858, 2009 and Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-Law No. C.S. 303, 2009) provide for closure of the fishery until June 2012 when the status of stocks will be fully reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3828">This review will consider whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  The EMP includes a comprehensive programme of monitoring and evaluation of management actions and their implementation.  It also includes a programme of scientific eel stock assessment to establish a stock baseline, estimate current silver eel escapement and monitoring the impact of the management actions on the local stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3829">Only three other Member States have had their plans approved by the Commission as meeting the requirements of the EC regulation.  Clearly the status of stocks in other Member States will differ from that of Ireland's depending on local conditions and therefore their plans may make different recommendations.  All must, however, demonstrate to the Commission's satisfaction, how they would achieve the targets necessary for recovery of the European eel stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3830">I am fully aware of the concerns about the demise of eel stocks and the fishery of those involved in eel fishing, arising from the public consultation undertaken in preparing the EMP and from my direct discussions with fishermen.  Some eel fishermen have been successful in tendering for the eel trap and transport operations which are being undertaken by the ESB under the EMP.  Others will have the opportunity to assist with scientific assessments.  There are no resources available to the Department to otherwise ameliorate the impact of the loss of the fishery.</p>

            <p eId="para_3834">The regulation of ESB customer supply electricity tariffs and BGÉ gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002.  The CER has exited from the regulation of tariffs for large energy users.  In the electricity sector more than 90% of business has switched to the independent electricity suppliers.  In the gas sector around 88%, in volume terms, of business has switched to the independent gas suppliers.  Approximately half of these large commercial customers are on variable tariffs.  As a result the substantial reductions in wholesale electricity and gas prices are already being reflected in their tariffs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3835">The CER is statutorily independent in the performance of its duties. However, there is regular communication between my Department and the CER.  All electricity users benefited in 2009 from direct subsidies totalling €567m.  These were made up of an ESB rebate to consumers of €315m, a repayment of certain Public Service Obligation (PSO) levies of €87m and the deferral of some network revenues until after October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3836">In July the Government agreed that these subsidies will continue for large energy users at their current level until October 2010 and will then be phased out over the following two year period.  This will benefit and in some cases will see businesses paying up to 40% less for electricity compared with what they were paying in 2008.  I welcome the fact that the CER lowered electricity prices for all customers by 10% and gas tariffs by an average of 12% for domestic and SME gas customers from May 1st 2009.  I also welcome the CER's most recent pricing decision, which approved an average decrease in gas tariffs of 9.8% with effect from 1 October 2009, with no change in electricity tariffs for domestic consumers.  The decrease was made possible by the downward shift in recent months in wholesale gas prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3837">It should be noted that major savings, in excess of these sums, are also available to domestic electricity consumers who decide to switch electricity suppliers and more than 10% of customers have availed of these opportunities so far.  In addition, there are a number of concrete actions that any customer can take to reduce their electricity consumption and hence their electricity bill as advised by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and reinforced by the "Power of One" campaign.  Small to Medium businesses will also see further reductions in their bills of 5.5% from this month as the new CER tariff decisions come into effect and deliver further benefits to business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3838">The CER has also recently announced that the PSO Levy will be zero for 2009/2010.  The PSO is the mechanism through which we support the security of our energy supplies and the development of wind and peat power in Ireland.  A zero PSO means that we are lessening our dependence upon fossil fuels without burdening business or electricity consumers with any additional costs.  Taken together, these actions will benefit all consumers of energy, including both large energy users, SMEs and domestic consumers, by significantly reducing the level of energy costs they would otherwise face in 2009\10.</p>

            <p eId="para_3842">Sustainable Energy Ireland figures indicate that 320 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe), of renewable energy was used in the generation of electricity during 2008 (from hydro, wind and biomass).  The renewable inputs to electricity generation avoided, in primary energy equivalent terms, 669 ktoe of primary energy requirements.  As coal is used as baseload, the renewables used in electricity generation are more likely to have avoided the use of oil and/or gas.  The avoided primary energy in 2008 represented approximately 21% of the oil and gas used in electricity generation in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">From recently published EirGrid figures, there is currently 1433 MW of renewable (wind, hydro, biomass) sources and 6120.9 MW of non renewable generation connected to Irish national grid.  The amount of renewable-powered plant connected and accessing the electricity grid is increasing steadily from year to year.  It is estimated the available plants will contribute 12.2% of all electricity consumed in 2009, compared to 4.4% in 2003.</p>

            <p eId="para_3845">The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes have resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  Of these projects, four are in the biodiesel category, five are in the pure plant oil category, four are in the bioethanol category and five are in the captive fleets category.  Since the excise relief schemes were introduced there has been a steady increase in biofuels used in Ireland, albeit from a very low base.  Prior to the introduction of the schemes, market penetration of biofuels was almost non-existent.  In 2007, penetration was 0.6% and in 2008 penetration had risen to 1.6%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3846">It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the position of individual companies within the schemes.  There have been at least five biofuels plants constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the schemes.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.  All but two of the projects are currently availing of the excise relief and my Department liaises with all project promoters on a regular basis, and monitors any ongoing oversight of the operation of the programme.  The introduction of the Biofuels Obligation in 2010 will provide the Irish biofuels sector with the certainty it needs to invest and grow in a sustainable way.</p>

This capacity approximates to 10 per cent of peak daily electricity demand in winter in Ireland.

            <p eId="para_3869">Interconnection will help reduce our dependence on electricity generated from imported natural gas and will enhance our security of supply by linking the all-island electricity market with the UK, which is in turn connected to mainland European markets. In this way, it will also support further competition in the electricity market which will directly benefit consumers and industry. It will also underpin the delivery of Ireland's renewable energy targets by providing additional back-up at times of low wind and enabling the export of wind energy from Ireland at times of high wind generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3871">The roll out of the national Smart Metering Programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the 2007 Programme for Government.  The Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand and to deliver greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.  This is a highly complex technology project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3872">The pilot phase of the programme, which encompasses two strands, technology and customer behaviour, is now under way.  Technology trials will test a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  Customer behaviour trials are determining the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.  The trials are essential to ensure that the optimum and most cost effective technology and systems are identified for the implementation phase.  The electricity technology trial will examine metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  Installation of up to 8,000 meters has commenced for technology testing in Limerick/Ennis, Cork City/Bandon and South Dublin/Wicklow.</p>
            <p eId="para_3873">Over 6,000 participants for the electricity customer behaviour trial have been selected to ensure that the sample is representative of Ireland's electricity consumers both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  The gas element of the pilot phase is also moving ahead.  Installation of over 1,900 meters for the Customer Behaviour Trial is on schedule for completion by end November.  A further 750 meters will be installed to facilitate the Gas Technology Trials.  A key component of the pilot phase is the associated cost benefit analysis, which will critically inform future decisions.  An interim analysis will be completed next year with the final analysis, to include the results of the gas trials, to be completed by mid 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3874">The smart metering pilot is proceeding in parallel with the current microgeneration initiative and there are important links between the two.  The data gathered from the interval meters being used in the microgeneration scheme will provide vital information on the import and export of electricity, which will feed into the analysis of electricity use being carried out in the electricity element of the smart metering pilot.  In turn, the findings of the smart metering pilot will also inform the development of a long term microgeneration strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3875">In February 2009 I launched the Micro Generation programme, which is being operated by ESB Customer Supply and supported by ESB Networks.  The programme will provide up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in micro-scale projects with a financial payment for electricity exported back to the grid.  The ESB has indicated that 92 customers had signed up for the scheme by September 2009.  At this stage it is too early in the scheme to provide additional data.  Further information on the programme is available at:</p>
            <p eId="para_3876">http://www.esb.ie/esbnetworks/generator_connections/micro_gen_connections.jsp</p>
            <p eId="para_3877">The scheme will also enable two-way metering, to be installed without additional charge to the customer.  The electricity producer will be paid a price of 19 cent per kilowatt-hour, which will help to offset the start up costs.  The micro technologies in question include wind, solar and hydro as well as combined heat and power.  It is the case that micro-scale electricity production will benefit the participating customers up-front by offsetting their purchase of electricity from their electricity suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3878">Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has also launched a Micro-generation Pilot Programme, involving research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis, of micro-scale projects.  The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.  Full details of the field trials, the criteria for applications, the involvement of the different technologies and customer groups and the exact level of support can be reviewed in the grants section of the SEI website.  40 applications have been approved to date.</p>

That policy paper sets out government strategy on (i) ensuring the availability of broadband services throughout Ireland and (ii) improving the speed and quality of those services.  The paper also set out the policy principles underpinning broadband regulation and required the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to produce an action plan setting out how the regulatory framework could be used to facilitate the roll out of next generation broadband networks.

            <p eId="para_3965">The ownership structure of rendering plants and any links between such plants and cattle slaughtering plants are commercial matters. The acceptance of ABP material by rendering plants from slaughter plants is also a matter for commercial negotiation between the plants concerned.  Slaughter plants also have the option, subject to authorisation in accordance with ABP regulatory requirements, of sending material for disposal outside the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3966">It is my policy to encourage alternative disposal options for ABP, including meat and bone meal (MBM) and tallow, which are the products of the rendering process, with a view to maximizing added value. I believe that this policy, together with the competition which exists in the marketplace, and the fact that there is adequate capacity in the Irish rendering industry, combine to ensure that the industry can cope well with any seasonal variations in slaughter numbers and that cattle prices are not adversely affected.</p>

            <p eId="para_3968">I understand that the Deputy is referring to the Cattle Movement Monitoring System (CMMS).  The CMMS system is being replaced on a phased basis by the Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) system.

The level of access granted to Department staff is that which is necessary to allow them to carry out their official duties.  The access granted to external users such as marts or individual keepers allows them to notify electronically legally required information such as an animal movement or a calf birth registration.  In addition, individual keepers can view information provided by them to the system such as their herd profile and information on animals in the herd.</p>

            <p eId="para_3972">On 15th July, the Government approved my plan for a reorganisation of my Department's Local Office Network. The plan involves reducing, from 57 to 16, the number of offices from which the Department will operate District Veterinary, Forestry and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services in the future. This will result in a reduction of some 400 in the number of staff working in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3973">The decisions on which offices to retain and which to close have nothing to do with the performance of any office or staff, rather decisions were made in relation to the overall strategy and against a background of major changes in the Department's operating environment in recent years brought about by the impact of the Single Farm Payment, benefits derived from substantial investment in Information Communications Technology and significant reductions in the incidence of disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_3974">The sudden and significant decline in the public finances since 2008 has required all of us to examine our expenditure to identify possible savings and you will be aware that major changes on the programme side of the Department have been implemented in recent months. When fully implemented this reorganisation will deliver very significant annual savings. While this reorganisation will yield significant savings for the exchequer, no staff will be made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3975">Improvements in business processes, information technology and communications will allow the Department to provide a quality service to our clients from the 16 enhanced offices set out in the plan.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_3983">I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 to 466, inclusive, 468 and 471 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3984">Ireland notified the draft Health (Country of Origin of Poultrymeat, Pigmeat and Sheepmeat) Regulations 2007 to the European Commission in December 2007.  Following a series of communications between the European Commission and my Department the Commission's direction to Ireland not to adopt the draft national Regulations was published as Decision 2009/291/EC of 20 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3985">The Commission's Decision describes the harmonised EU regime for the regulation of food labelling as set out in Directive 2000/13/EC — the ‘Labelling Directive'- and the exceptional circumstances in which national provisions are permissible. Against this background the basis for the Commission's negative opinion, as set out in this Decision, was that the proposed regulations did not fulfil the requirements of the Labelling Directive concerning the permissibility of non-harmonised national legislation. It contended that the draft Regulations would create a disproportionate obstacle to trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_3986">On the issue of misleading information, my Department has, on numerous occasions in writing and at meetings, brought to the Commission's attention the fact that industry practices often create a mistaken impression of origin. These practices include the sale of products under familiar local brand names, the use of ‘traditional' logos, old-style scripts, pictures and artwork depicting local geographical features. The rules applicable to health marks may also lead to confusion. My view is that the Labelling Directive does not provide a sufficiently strong basis for counteracting these practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3987">At a meeting in July 2008 the results of a Periscope study commissioned by Bord Bia were given to the Commission. This study indicated that in Ireland 26% of people always check the origin of groceries and a further 46% sometimes check. In Britain 50% of people always or sometimes check. This survey also indicated the continuing upward trend (from 50% in 2001 to 72% in 2007) in the proportion of Irish people who always or sometimes check for origin. 65% of those surveyed agreed strongly or slightly with the statement ‘I like to know the area where my food comes from'. The recommendations of the Food Labelling Group established by my Department has also been mentioned to the Commission as evidence of public interest in origin labelling.</p>
            <p eId="para_3988">Despite the evidence of misleading information and of consumer support for origin labelling the Commission continues to object to the relevant national legislation. The vast majority of Member States support this stance and consider that the matter should be dealt with on a harmonised EU basis rather than on an individual national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3989">In the light of the Commission's negative opinion the initiative on national origin labelling legislation has now concluded. It is intended to pursue harmonised EU rules on origin labelling in the context of the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers.  The Department of Health and Children is the lead Department for that proposal and has been reflecting Ireland's position at relevant meetings on the subject.  My Department is consulting The EU Commission with a view to release of relevant correspondence on this issue to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3995">The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for the enforcement of this legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (F.S.A.I.).</p>
            <p eId="para_3996">There are no official statistics showing the comparative cost of imported versus home produced primary products.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  I understand that these draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3997">Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, my Department had taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific labelling legislation since September 2000.  The terminology "substantial transformation" originates in WTO, CODEX and EU Legislation governing the EU Custom Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products. This was one of the principal points made to the European Commission in the context of our request for their approval of our proposed national arrangements.  However it should be noted that we continue to achieve significant exports of our home produced products.  For example in the pigmeat sector whilst imports last year were in the region of 75,000 tonnes we exported over 120,000 tonnes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3998">The issue of more informative and clear labelling will continue to be pursued by the Department of Health and Children at EU level in the context of the current review. We are pressing for the inclusion of a requirement to indicate the origin of primary ingredients in finished products.</p>

            <p eId="para_4014">I propose to take Questions Nos. 478 and 479 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4015">I am taking it that by non-core pay the Deputy is referring to payments that are discretionary in nature and not determined pay arrangements for the grade or appointment in question.  Non-core pay in respect of staff in my Department amounted to €1,438,343 in 2008, of which €1,181,914 was represented by overtime payments. Non-core pay paid to date in 2009 amounts to €514,369 of which €484,178 is represented by overtime payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4016">In relation to the State Examinations Commission non-core pay amounted to €1,661,911 in 2008, of which €1,537,749 was in respect of overtime payments. In 2009 to date, non-core pay amounted to €1,107,765 of which €1,017,799 was in respect of overtime.  Allowances paid to teachers employed in primary, secondary and community/comprehensive schools, on payrolls operated by my Department, are included as part of salary and are not considered as non-core pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_4017">With regard to other bodies and agencies under the aegis of my Department, issues in relation to pay, including non-core pay, are a matter for each agency. This information is not collated centrally by my Department. However, if the Deputy has a particular aegis body in mind, I can request my officials to obtain the relevant details and communicate them to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_4021">As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can  have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4022">The SCPA was first put in operation for the 2001/02 academic year and the number of assessments undertaken per annum since its inception and the number of SCPA psychologists who engaged in those assessments is set out in the following table for the Deputy's information.  From the establishment of the scheme a fee of €330 was paid to SCPA psychologists for each assessment undertaken.  From the start of the current academic year a reduction of 8% was applied to this fee pursuant to Government Decision S180/20/10/0964C of 3rd February, 2009 resulting in a fee of €304 per assessment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4108">I propose to take Questions Nos. 484 and 485 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4109">Under the terms of my Department's student grant and free fees schemes, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants and free tuition fees where they satisfy the prescribed conditions of the individual schemes including those relating to progression. In general students who previously pursued a course of study are not eligible for grant assistance or free tuition fees in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant or tuition fees were paid previously. Subject to various conditions of the individual schemes, in certain circumstances free tuition and grants are available where students are progressing e.g. to a course at a higher level. I have no proposals to depart from the above.</p>
            <p eId="para_4110">There are a number of initiatives which provide additional support to students who are in long term receipt of certain social welfare payments. Students who qualify for a maintenance grant for their attendance on a recognised full-time approved course in a third-level institution or PLC Centre may also qualify for the higher, Special Rate of maintenance grant if they satisfy the relevant terms and conditions.  To qualify for the Special Rate of maintenance grant, an applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant in respect of the relevant academic year. In addition, total reckonable income must not exceed a specified amount which, for the 2009/10 academic year, is €22,308 in the 2008 tax year. Finally, the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4111">The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force. Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_4236">Ireland has not ratified the UNESCO 1989 Convention on Technical and Vocational Education, and has no plans to do so. There are only 17 parties to the Convention to date, out of 193 UNESCO Member States, mostly in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. Only two EU Member States, Bulgaria and Lithuania, have ratified the Convention and this occurred in the early 1990s, prior to their accession to the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_4237">Notwithstanding the above, Ireland is committed to common approaches to quality in vocational education and training and higher education under the Copenhagen and Bologna processes. Through its membership of the EU, and with the support of the European Structural Funds, Ireland has expanded its vocational education and training system, and has developed a single unified national framework of qualifications which covers all awards in the State, across the education and training sectors. Ireland was the first country in the EU to reference its National Framework of Qualifications to the European Qualifications Framework and will progressively implement two further European Recommendations aimed at facilitating mobility and improving quality in vocational education and training across Europe, adopted in June 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_4240">There are 3 schools concerned in the Deputy's question, 2 primary schools and 1 post primary school.  The first primary school was one of ten projects announced in January 2009 to be re-tendered. In order to prepare for tender and to comply with the new form of Government contract, the school was required to submit a new Stage 2b (detailed design).</p>
            <p eId="para_4241">Following the receipt and clearance of the Stage 2b (detailed design) submission, the project was authorised to go to tender in July, and a tender report is awaited.  When this has been received, the project will be considered for progression to the next stage i.e. the award stage.  The second primary school was approved funding under the Summer Works Scheme for 2009 for a fire alarm.  It received funding in previous years under this Scheme to upgrade its toilets and for entrance widening.</p>
            <p eId="para_4242">The post primary school has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_4243">The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_4244">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  In the meantime, the school has received funding under the Summer Works Scheme for 2009 to refurbish sciences labs and funding under the Department's Emergency Works Scheme for 2009 to upgrade its mechanical system.</p>

Calculations on average costs at this stage of the year will not accurately reflect comparative costs between 2008 and 2009 until then.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  Work is well underway and the firm of specialists is working closely with officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department.  The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.  The work also involves negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate.  Progress has been made in all areas of the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4257">I would again like to assure the Deputy that it is intended to further reduce the rental costs associated with temporary school accommodation and the arrangements to achieve these reductions are well underway.  An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.  A considerable number of meetings have taken place between the firm of specialists engaged by my Department for this task and the prefabricated accommodation suppliers.  It is expected that negotiations will be concluded shortly on a number of these.</p>

            <p eId="para_4267">There is a wide range of further education programmes that are open to mature students which provide retraining and upskilling options.  These are both full-time and part-time and are delivered through the Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  They include the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS), a second-chance education initiative for persons who are at least 21 years of age and more than six months unemployed; Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses, which are full-time courses for students who have completed their Leaving Certificate and for adults returning to education; and the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) which provides flexible, part-time further education options to enable persons to combine a return to learning with family, work or other commitments.  BTEI courses are free for all adults with a less than upper second level education, including the unemployed.  It is also open to mature students to apply for places on higher education programmes.  Indeed, over 12,000 applications have been received from mature students for full-time higher education programmes for the 2009/10 academic year, an increase of 30% on 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4268">Mature students who secure a place on a full time programme may be eligible for support under this Department's Student Maintenance Grant Scheme.  Provision of grants is subject to a means test and other eligibility criteria.  Further information on how to apply is available on the Student Finance website: www.studentfinance.ie.  Unemployed people may also be eligible to participate in the Department of Social and Family Affairs Back to Education Allowance Scheme.  Under this scheme, unemployed people in full time education receive a Back to Education allowance which is equivalent to the maximum personal rate of the Job Seekers Allowance.  Recipients also receive a Cost of Education allowance of €500 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4269">Since the beginning of the year the Government has launched a number of new initiatives to support unemployed people return to education and engage in upskilling.  In the higher education sector measures include 2,500 new places to enable unemployed people pursue undergraduate and postgraduate courses on a part-time basis; 280 places on a range of newly developed accelerated Level 6 Certificate programmes and over 900 places on a range of newly developed part-time transition programmes.  In the further education sector, the Government has provided an additional 1,500 PLC places, bringing the total number of PLC places to 31,688 nationwide.  The scope to introduce further labour market activation initiatives is under consideration by my Department in the context of ongoing discussions with other Government Departments on developing appropriate upskilling training and education responses for unemployed people.</p>

            <p eId="para_4275">The funding of the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme is a reflection of the Government's gratitude for the significant contribution made by Senator Mitchell to the promotion of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  The Government provided an endowment of £2 million for the programme in 1999.  In 2007, a decision was taken to secure the long term viability of this programme by increasing Ireland's contribution to the fund for the programme by €20 million to be paid over a number of years conditional on matching funding being raised by the US-Ireland Alliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4276">Implementation of this decision requires, <i>inter alia</i>, amendment of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act 1998 and a new management and funding agreement between the US-Ireland Alliance and my Department.  It is envisaged that the increased future investment income from the additional funding of up to €40 million, inclusive of matching funding, would primarily meet the cost of administration and bursaries for the successful students undertaking post-graduate study and research in universities and other approved institutions on the island of Ireland.

            <p eId="para_4278">The funding of the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme is a reflection of the Government's gratitude for the significant contribution made by Senator Mitchell to the promotion of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  The Government provided an endowment of IR£2million for the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund in 1999.  Under the terms of a 1999 agreement between the US-Ireland Alliance and my Department, the Alliance was obliged to invest the monies contributed by the Irish Government in order to generate an income to meet the cost of funding one or more scholarships per year as well as the administration costs of the US-Ireland Alliance for these awards.  The nominal value of the Fund decreased in a difficult investment climate in the US.  In 2003 a decision was made to rest the Fund for a period by not making any disbursements in respect of scholarships from the income generated from the Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_4279">Since 2003, the full quota (12) of scholarships has been funded from other resources raised by the US Ireland Alliance and the only expenses paid from the Fund have been the costs of the annual audit of the accounts and investment advisory fees for the Fund.  The information sought by the Deputy in respect of expenditure is set out in the following table.  This information is taken from the audited accounts for the Fund which have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_4391">The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4392">The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 370 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.  Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_4393">My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service.  My Department's ABA pilot scheme provides funding to 13 centres, and was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.  Now that a national network of special classes catering specifically for children with autism is available in schools, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme.  I am pleased to advise that broad agreement has been reached on the core conditions to enable these centres to be recognised as special schools for children with autism and applications have been received for special school recognition from the centres in question.  These schools, once recognised, will provide education for children with autism in line with my Department's policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4415">The Deputy will be aware that the pupils in question have chosen to attend a school outside of their own catchment area.  In that regard, they may only avail of concessionary/catchment boundary transport subject to the general rules of the scheme namely, they must be eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside; if catchment boundary transport is approved and spare seats are available, they must make their own way to the nearest pick up point outside of their own catchment area; no additional cost should be involved in re-routing or extending an existing service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4416">To pick up children from within their own catchment area, such as is proposed by the Deputy, would have national implications.  In view of the concessionary nature of catchment boundary transport, which is not guaranteed, the pupils in Narraghmore will have to make their way to the boundary.  I should add that the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, is due to be completed by the end of 2009.</p>
