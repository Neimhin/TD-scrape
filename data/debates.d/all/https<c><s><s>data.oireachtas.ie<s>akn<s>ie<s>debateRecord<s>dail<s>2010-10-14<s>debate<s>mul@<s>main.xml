          <p eId="para_9">I wish to raise two issues.  The Tánaiste told the country on 27 January that there would be a loan scheme for small businesses.  Her successor, the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, told the country in June that there would be such a scheme and again in September he told the Small Firms Association that the plans were well advanced.  Many Fianna Fáil backbenchers could not wait to spread the good news.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">However, yesterday we got a very confused answer from the Taoiseach.  Where is the legislation to enable this to happen?  This is an important issue for business.  There are 80,000 businesses in this sector and 800,000 people employed in it.  Similar schemes have operated across the Europe and elsewhere, including in Chile and Taiwan, where I visited during the summer.  They have been extraordinarily successful and have not been a burden on the exchequer of those respective states.</p>

As we enter the busiest time of year in terms of demand on our hospitals and health services, we learn that the Health Service Executive will close 28 beds in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan from next Monday.  One ward with 15 beds is closing, as is a surgical ward with 13 beds.  At the same time, the HSE has announced the cancellation until next Friday at the earliest of outpatient clinics and non-emergency operations in Cavan General Hospital.  It was also confirmed yesterday that three patients are being treated for the potentially fatally Clostridium difficile at Our Lady's Hospital in Drogheda.  This has clearly arisen as a result of overcrowding.  The hospital system in Dublin North and Dublin North-East cannot cope with these additional closures.</p>

I will reply to his letter later today.  On the information that is being provided to the Opposition parties, what arrangements will be made for departmental Estimates to be made available to the Opposition parties?  It used to be the practice that the Estimates were published in advance of the budget — at one stage they were published a couple of months in advance.  The Government changed this practice and for the past two or three years the Estimates have been published on budget day as an appendix to the Budget Statement.  Will the departmental expenditure Estimates be published in advance of the budget this year?  If not, what arrangements are being made to make the details of the Estimates available to the Opposition parties?</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The third matter, which is not unrelated to the previous issue, is the environment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is on the list to be published this session.  Its purpose is to extend the landfill levy to include incineration.  Is it the Government's intention to have the Bill enacted prior to the budget?  Will revenues arising from the extension of the landfill levy to incinerators be included in the 2011 budgetary figures?  What is the Government's estimate of the revenue that will arise from the levy for the purposes of the four year budget plan?</p>

In common with all the other health spokespersons, I am very worried about what will happen over the winter months in respect of people's eligibility for hospital services.  I refer in particular to people living in the environs of Navan and Cavan hospitals, as well as in the west, where people are losing their home helps.  There is great concern that as the winter approaches, people who might be eligible for health services will not get them and that the entire system is breaking down.  A debate on this issue is needed in this House and I suggest that were the Government to introduce the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill, Members would be able to debate such issues.  Moreover, it must be debated before the introduction of the next budget because if the health budget is slashed again, the health services will not be able to operate.</p>

I have tried to ask yourself, a Cheann Comhairle and the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice and Law Reform if they are considering legislation on the illegal occupation of lands which are now in the NAMA portfolio and which are causing grave distress to residents, mortgage payers and young people who are in negative equity and trying to pay their mortgages.  The Garda Síochána seems not to have the requisite legislative authority to end illegal occupations, particularly where there are housing programmes for all citizens in an area.  Does the Tánaiste have an opinion on the need to strengthen legislation on the illegal occupation of lands, specifically lands in the NAMA portfolio or former development lands of local authorities?

          <p eId="para_180">On 5 October 2010, when responding to questions about the status of preparations for Census 2011, I stated: "My understanding is that on the publication of the final and full results of the CSO that the boundary review is done, not on the preliminary figures."</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I have since clarified this matter with the Central Statistics Office and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and now wish to outline the CSO's plans with regard to publication of the results of the census.  The judgment in the 2007 Murphy, McGrath and Molloy High Court case concluded that, having regard to the constitutional requirements and the high quality of CSO preliminary population data, consideration should be given to initiation of constituency revisions on publication of the CSO preliminary report on a census, with the revision work being completed when the final data are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009 responded fully to the High Court judgment and introduced new provisions relating to the revision of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies.  The 2009 Act provides that, in future, commissions will be established on publication by the Central Statistics Office, following a census of population, of the census report setting out the preliminary result of the census in respect of the total population of the State; and a commission will have to report as soon as may be after publication by the CSO of the census report setting out the final result of the census in respect of the total population of the State and, in any event, not later than three months after such publication.  Previously, commissions had to await final results before starting work and then had six months to complete their task.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Therefore, the likely sequence of events that will unfold under these arrangements is along the following lines: census to be held in April 2011; preliminary results published in July 2011, which will trigger the establishment of a new constituency commission; final results in March 2012, that is, within one year of census day; the commission would be expected to report within three months, that is, by June 2012; and the 30th Dáil, which first met on 14 June 2007, to be dissolved no later than 13 June 2012.</p>

        <heading>Announcement by Minister for Finance on Banking of 30 September 2010: Statements (Resumed)</heading>
        <speech by="#MargaretConlon" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_185">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the banking crisis.  This is not the first time I have spoken on the banking crisis that has taken us all by storm and rocked us to our very foundations.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Members on all sides of the House have been disgusted by the events which brought us to the famous night in September 2008 and the decisions subsequently taken not to bail our banks, bankers or developers, but to keep our economy functioning and our country running.  I have made no secret of the fact that I deplore and condemn those people who engaged in reckless lending practices.  I hold no court for any banker, builder or developer but I know they brought us to the brink.  Of course, people are angry, and rightly so.  I am angry myself.  I am furious at what has happened.  However, anger is not a solution.  It is not an answer to the problems and will not get us anywhere.  We can continue to bemoan what has happened and talk about mistakes that were made, who is to blame for them and who should have done this or that.  However, that will not get us anywhere.  We can look back in anger but we must move forward with hope and determination.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Mistakes were made on all sides of the House.  I was not here during the good years, and there were many good years, but I remember reading speeches by Members of the Opposition at that time.  The all contained calls for increased government spending and reduced taxes.  No matter how much was spent or committed to projects and no matter by how much taxes were reduced, people on the opposite side of the House said it was not enough.  They said the Government should have been spending more and cutting taxes by more.  It is important to place that on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">We faced recession before.  We had it in the 1970s and 1980s.  Anyone who thinks this is the last time we will face a recession is mistaken.  We will have recessions in the future because the economy is cyclical.  An economic boom is followed by a recession.  So the cycle goes, and it will happen again.  We are dealing with a difficult economic situation and people who had jobs find they no longer have them.  Households find their incomes are drastically reduced.  People who have left college wonder if there is a future for them.  I see pupils in the Gallery this morning.  They are wondering what will happen to them.  Will they have a job when they finish their education?  These are the questions people are asking.  If we work together in the national interest and put aside our differences, we will come through this difficulty and emerge as a better and stronger country.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">When things were good we lost many of our values.  People were so busy making money and so concerned with their own lives that they forgot about their neighbours and communities.  We lost our sense of community spirit.  In my own constituency I see a return to that.  Communities are getting up and doing things for themselves because they see these times not as something big and bad, but as an opportunity to make things better for their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I will speak for a few minutes about Anglo Irish Bank in plain simple terms.   Winding down Anglo Irish Bank on that night in September 2008 was simply not an option.  The bank held investments of €80 billion, a figure of huge magnitude. We used to speak about hundreds, thousands and millions but now we have moved on to billions.  Those investments were owned by Irish pension funds, local authorities, small and medium sized enterprises and credit unions.  It would have been irresponsible of the Government to let that money go.  People were angry about what happened but one can only imagine the anger of the ordinary men and women of this country if the money vanished.  I acknowledge the taxpayer will pay a high price but we must inject capital into these institutions if we are to prevent them from collapsing.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">These injections of funds will add to our national debt but it is not fair to compare them with annual adjustments in the budget because doing so creates the false impression that savings made in the budget will be ploughed into the banks.  The cost of resolving the problems of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide is a once-off addition to the national debt.  Typically, countries do not repay their national debts but instead pay annual interest repayments for an indefinite period.  This recurring expenditure is the proper figure to compare to the annual budgetary adjustments.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The Central Bank carried out a detailed analysis of potential losses in our banks in coming years and the Department of Finance is working to reorganise the financial sector.  Better regulation and organisation is necessary because banks can never again be allowed to behave as they did in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I regret the day when the power to grant or refuse loans was taken away from the local bank managers, who knew their customers' income and liabilities and could accurately assess whether they would be able to repay their loans.  They investigated the financial situation of prospective borrowers on an individual basis.  That power was transferred to faceless people in a head office somewhere in the ether.  These people knew nothing and cared even less about the individuals concerned or their financial histories.  They did not have the best interests of their customers at heart because they were more interested in being rewarded for increasing their bank's loan books.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">We now have an opportunity to introduce reform but this must be done in a constructive and positive manner.  I am fed up with the constantly negative portrayal of this country in the media.  From the time one switches on the radio at 7 a.m. until one turns off the television at midnight one does not hear or see a single positive story, with the exception of the historic rescue of the Chilean miners.  It is time that we be positive in focusing on the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">There is broad agreement on the necessity of cutting our budget deficit to meet the EU target of 3% by 2014.  We face the challenge of doing this in a way that minimises the pain for the vulnerable and marginalised.  We have to consider taxation, public service provision and unemployment figures.  We must give people hope that they will be able to return to employment and thereby make a valuable contribution.  We must investigate how savings can be achieved through the Croke Park deal.   The reality is that we are spending €5 for every €3 taken in.  One could not keep one's house going indefinitely under that financial arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I welcome that the Taoiseach has reiterated his desire to engage the Opposition parties in constructive talks on the four year budgetary plan and that his proposal has been accepted by Deputies Kenny and Gilmore.  I think we all agree this is not a time for business or politics as usual.  It is important that all sensible and viable proposals are examined in detail.  It is most helpful that officials from the Department of Finance have briefed Opposition Deputies on our financial situation.  We must leave the bickering to one side and demonstrate that we are putting the best interest of the country and our constituents first.  People are not impressed by the negativity that currently exists and, no more than anger, petty bickering and squabbling will not provide a solution.  As politicians, we need to put our heads together to give hope to the people we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">The 450,000 people who are unemployed will not have hope if we cannot make credit flow into the economy and for this we need a healthy functioning banking system.  Any citizen who has money on deposit has a legitimate expectation that his or her deposit will be safe and accessible.  If we had not put the bank guarantee system in place, many ordinary people would have lost their hard earned savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Despite the difficulties small and medium sized enterprises face in accessing credit, they are making a huge contribution to our economy in difficult circumstances by keeping people at work, producing goods and services and contributing to export growth.  To survive, these businesses need credit and working capital.  I do not advocate a return to reckless lending practices but if a business had a good record and a viable future, it should be given the tools it needs, including credit, to remain in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The announcement of the bill for Anglo Irish Bank has brought us certainty because we now know the nature of the problems we face.  The next step is dealing with these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I commend the Minister for Finance on the way in which he has been dealing with issues pertaining to his Department and to banking.  He has been clear, open and honest in providing information.  He has had a very difficult job but he has discharged his duties in an admirable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I welcome the comment from Standard &amp; Poor's, which stated this week that concerns about our fiscal and political risks have been exaggerated.  It even predicts Ireland will recover from this recession faster than other peripheral European countries.  This little bit of positivity that should be highlighted as it is important.  It is the kind of positive news that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We have faced up to the reality of what the bank guarantee will cost.  We are preparing the plan to get our finances in order.  We are working with Opposition parties, whose viable, credible and workable proposals will be given due consideration.  I am not interested in going back over the same problem time and again.  I am sick, sore and tired listening to the mantra that we bailed out the banks, builders and developers.  Let me say for what I hope will be the last time in this House that we did not bail out any banker, builder or developer.  We bailed out and assisted our economy to keep it functioning, to provide jobs, assist businesses and protect the deposits of those who have put their hard-earned money into deposit accounts.  I am not interested in playing the blame game and am only interested in the solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">There is some light at the end of a long, dark tunnel.  There are still difficult and painful decisions to be made.  I am not under any illusion in that regard.  Although the budget will be extremely difficult, if we work together in a spirit of co-operation, we can make it work.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">This debate on banking is being held two weeks after the renewal of the guarantee on Thursday, 30 September.  Although the debate looks back to that date, a lot has happened since.  The stark problem facing the nation in the budget in December concerns how we can bridge the €20 billion gap between income and expenditure.  It is a challenge for all parties.  Fine Gael will not be found wanting in contributing to that debate.  We welcome the letter from the Taoiseach yesterday and that from the leader of the Green Party, Deputy John Gormley.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Deputy Conlon said Fianna Fáil would welcome input from all parties across the House.  I hope that is the case.  The debate on the Order of Business this morning on the information that will be available to Opposition parties throws up some serious questions.  We need consensus on our financial position.  Fine Gael has said it does not know the figures.  The IMF mentioned a figure of €10.7 billion.  I do not know whether that is the figure the Government is working with.  As a nation, we should commit to a deficit target of below 3% of GDP by 2014.  This should be front loaded.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Full information will have to be provided to all parties.  The Tánaiste said this morning that the figures would not be published until budget time.  The proposed expenditure of Departments will not be available until the day of the budget.  Unless the Government knows what it has to spend, how can the Opposition propose options?  The questions that have been raised seriously concern me and others on this side of the House.  We need full information.  If it is to be a case of business as usual, and we do not have the full figures, what is Fine Gael being asked to participate in?  Will it be the same kind of business as last year?  I hope not.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The banking policy of the Government has failed and that is why we are here today.  We are facing a scenario in which our ratio of debt to GDP will peak at 32% this year.  This is unheard of and has consequences for every man, woman and child in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The bank guarantee in September 2008 represented a momentous occasion, in addition to Thursday, 30 September 2010.  The banking inquiry of Professor Patrick Honohan, which covered the period 2003 to the end of 2008, which period commenced with the establishment of the Financial Regulator, points to excessive weaknesses in Irish banks.  These were exposed by the collapse of the global markets in May 2007.  However, when compared to the imbalances that had been building up during the previous decade, we note we had a home-grown problem.  It is not good enough to blame global crises, as some are so good at doing.  We now know well the reason for Ireland's problems.  There was over-reliance on the construction sector for employment, for providing income to the State coffers and for activity in banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The banks availed of cheap money from international markets and flooded the markets at home.  When the money dried up, the whole edifice came crashing down like a pack of cards.  It is not good enough to blame the international markets as we should have known better.  We as a nation should blame ourselves and seek to determine what went wrong and how we can rectify the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Income from the property sector was never going to be available forever.  Warning signs were evident but they were not heeded.  Warnings came from Opposition parties and from economists outside the House.  It was irresponsible to expand the public sector and services on the back of funding that would eventually dry up.  It was unsustainable.  There were enormous increases in the education and health sectors and a growth in quangos.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">When one looks back, one must ask what kind of thinking prevailed at the time in question.  Prudent economic management ordains that, during a boom such as ours, we should have invested in productive infrastructure.  By this, I mean infrastructure associated with electricity supply, broadband, telecommunications and transport.  Such investment did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The OECD points out that Ireland continually fails abysmally in international comparisons.  The quality of infrastructure is definitely linked to economic growth.  It is vital to competitiveness.  In the World Economic Forum's competitiveness report, Ireland is ranked 65th, near Hungary.  All the figures point to Ireland's low rate of investment in productive infrastructure.  It plummeted between 2001 and 2009.  We will now pay the price for this because we badly need quality infrastructure to ensure employment growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Construction output peaked at €38 billion in 2007.  However, less than 20% of this pertained to public infrastructure.  Some 60% of the output between 2000 and 2007 was invested in private residential apartments and non-residential sector developments.  I do not know exactly how much those assets' values have dropped; it is a question of the length of a piece of string.  While we had a boom in the construction sector, only 20% of the output resulted in public infrastructure.  Prudent management did not exist.  The infrastructure that was needed to support enterprise and plan for our future was not put in place.  Instead, we had a party and a great boom.  Now we are experiencing a hangover.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">During the years in question, did we have light regulation, heavy regulation or no regulation of the banking sector?  Was there ever a fear of a regulator's visit to any of the banks?  Was Mr. Patrick Neary's office even a mild annoyance to the banking sector?  I believe not.  From 2003 onwards, the Financial Regulator was just not an issue for the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Mr. Honohan states in his report that it is clear that a major failure, in terms of bank regulation and the maintenance of financial stability, has occurred.  The report also identified three areas to which we can point in this regard, namely, failure of supervision in individual institutions, failure in terms of approach to stability policy and failure to undertake decisive and remedial investigation.  Investigations in this regard are continuing.  We are awaiting another report on the ability of the Department of Finance to play its part in terms of whether it was fit for purpose, had the correct information available to it and had the professionals needed to understand what the markets were doing and the influence these markets would have on a country like Ireland, which has a small open economy whose banks were dependent on international funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The Central Bank Strategic Plan 2010-2012 provides some comfort in terms of its putting in place the structures that are needed.  It outlines how a new model of regulation is to be implemented.  This must be underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.  Issues such as the need for greater enhanced assessment of financial stability, which is a much broader and deeper level of analysis, and careful and ongoing management of the liquidity to support our domestic banks are also dealt with in this plan.  The plan recognises the need for the Central Bank to promote authoritative advice to the Government, now more important than ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Mr. Honohan and Mr. Elderfield are providing confidence in terms of their approach to the job they are doing.  Their job is a difficult one.  While Mr. Honohan and Mr. Elderfield are important appointees for the country, they are also important in terms of the strong message they are sending to the international markets, namely, that we recognise where we went wrong and are putting in place structures to ensure this never happens again.  This type of confidence is essential.</p>

          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
          <p eId="para_220">We are speaking on this topic two weeks after the Minister for Finance made his announcement.  This issue has been in a sense discussed to death in the media and in this House.  We have had many debates on the banking crisis during the past two years.  There is a legitimate sense of frustration on this side of the House that some, in fact most, of the warnings flagged by spokespeople on the Opposition benches were largely ignored by the Government.  While we have heard some platitudes in regard to constructive engagement by all parties in finding solutions to the general economic crisis, the solutions proffered by us are largely ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Deputy Conlon's lament that we should not look back but should simply look forward is simplistic.  It would be an indictment of this House were we not to reflect on the decisions taken, the absence of regulation and the mistakes made.  It is imperative we do this.  It is also imperative this is done by way of independent investigation.  Sadly, a comprehensive review of political decision making and regulatory issues does not appear to be on the cards, which is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">As we approached the introduction in this House of the NAMA legislation this time last year we were being told by way of strong and convincing narrative in the national media, by almost all commentators and a significant cohort of economic experts, political correspondents and so on,  that NAMA was the only show in town and the only way forward and that the Government's approach to the banking crisis was essentially the only option.  This has been proven conclusively to be incorrect.  We have seen, in particular during the past three or four months, a slow but eventual realisation that the points consistently put forward by our spokespeople on finance since the introduction of the bank guarantee scheme in 2008, that the concept of total and utter exposure of taxpayers to what in effect are the liabilities of risk takers, was and is unjust, inequitable and not propitious.  While this was dismissed in a somewhat arrogant manner by Ministers and others it has proven to be correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">In most other jurisdictions bondholders who took risks in the full knowledge they were taking them have at least suffered some consequences.  In no other jurisdiction did a Government adopt the approach of signing blank cheques for defunct financial institutions, as happened here.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan said at the time — I am open to correction as it may have been the Taoiseach who said this — that Government policy was to write whatever cheques were necessary to bail out all banks, including delinquent banks like Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  This was unfair, not prudent, not in the national interest and could not in any way be perceived or understood to be in the interests of taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">It is important and incumbent upon us as public representatives to remember that we are elected to this House not to represent bankers or international bondholders and risk takers but to represent and protect the interests of taxpayers and to spend hard earned taxpayers' moneys wisely and prudently in the national interest and, more important, in the interests of those taxpayers.  This has not, by any stretch of the imagination, been our approach to the banking crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">This debate must be had in the context of the last two budgets, which have been punitive, and the forthcoming budget which is likely to be even more punitive.  People are legitimately angry and frustrated and they feel helpless.  Our citizens no longer believe they have any control over how their taxes are spent or in regard to decision making at Government level.  People are fully prepared to take the hit and to play their part in trying to rectify the abysmal state of the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The spirit of co-operation we have witnessed during the past 18 months is unrivalled in other countries.  However, they are only willing to do this on the basis of the approach taken being fair.  It is difficult for our citizens to take hits in terms of pay cuts, income levies and so on given what is happening in regard to Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  It is difficult for citizens to contemplate what is happening in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, AIB, Irish Nationwide and even Bank of Ireland, particularly when they are being asked to take hits in the context of public pay, increased income tax, the imposition of income levies, etc., and in view of the fact that no sanctions have been imposed with regard to failures in regulation.  Sanctions have not been imposed on any banker and they certainly have not been imposed on any Minister.  It is highly unlikely that they will ever be imposed on Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Sanctions have not been imposed on anyone who participated in the grand conspiracy to trade recklessly in the banking and construction sectors.  Likewise, there have been no sanctions in respect of flawed decision-making on the part of or bad policies adopted by poor Ministers whose judgment would not be considered appropriate in the context of running a parish council not to mention operating complex banking regulatory systems.  Individual citizens who have been doing their jobs, paying their taxes and minding their own business are extremely angry with regard to the pain being inflicted on them, particularly when those who were responsible for the economic catastrophe that has befallen the country are getting away scot free.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Those are the main points I wish to make.  It is important that we should reflect on the failures that have brought us to our current position.  We must also reflect on the fact that the public will not be content to take much more of what is being handed out if sanctions are not imposed on those responsible for causing our current difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Over 75% of the money used to recapitalise the banks has been put into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  As already stated, these are essentially dysfunctional and defunct financial institutions which will never lend money again.  The original priority, as stated by Government Ministers and, in particular, by the Minister for Finance, <i>ad nauseam</i>, for recapitalising the banks was to free up the flow of credit to SMEs.  That was the logic which underpinned many of the decisions — including those relating to the bank guarantee scheme and the recapitalisation programme — made in the past 18 months.  Most of that money is being put into banks that will never again be in a position to lend.  In such circumstances, serious consideration should be given to accelerating the wind-down process in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.  That institution should be wound down and we should begin to concentrate of restoring the balance sheets of Allied Irish Banks plc and Bank of Ireland to health.  The latter institutions are of systemic importance while the other banks do not really matter in the context of the future of the economy.  The Government should dispose of those which are in trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">There is a great deal more to be said on this topic.  I do not doubt that similar debates in respect of it will be held in the near future.  The bank guarantee is going to have to be extended in the new year.  It would have been for more honest if the Government had acknowledged that in the first instance rather than extending the guarantee for a period of three to four months.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_231">Black Thursday, and all that went before it, threatens to undermine Ireland's economic sovereignty.  In 1997, a Fianna Fáil-led Government inherited an economy that was in pristine condition.  Some 13 years later, a Fianna Fáil-led Government is pleading for bipartisan co-operation in order to keep the IMF wolf from the door.  What has happened in this country represents a scale of collapse not experienced by any other western democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Labour Party will make common cause with the Government in seeking to ensure that it will not be necessary to make application to the European financial stabilisation fund.  There is a definite prospect that if this country is forced to seek external assistance, it will come with very severe strings attached.  Ceding economic sovereignty is not in the interests of our people.  The Labour Party consented to the parameters agreed — prior to Black Thursday — with the European Commission, including last year's budgetary provision to take €4 billion out of the public finances.  We committed to making savings of a further €3 billion in the forthcoming budget.  There is no precedent for a similar gesture on the part of Fianna Fáil on any matter of policy when in opposition.  However, the goalposts have changed again.  The nightmare cost of the bank bailout has placed additional pressure on the Government and exposed how vulnerable we are to outside intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Members of the public are punch drunk and are trying to figure out how the country should find itself in this position.  How did our Government allow this happen?  Why did the Government, in light of the advice available to it, make the decision it made on the night of 29 September 2008?  Who advised the Government to give a blanket guarantee?  Why did the Government make no intervention between the collapse of Northern Rock and 29 September 2008, a period of more than one year?  Why did the Government take no action after the collapse in the value of Anglo Irish Bank shares six months prior to 29 September 2008?  How is it that the Government could still claim after the collapse that there was no solvency problem in the Irish banks?  Why have the figures that have been drip fed to us by Government since the collapse invariably been wrong?  These figures have not just been wrong, they have been wrong by a mile?  Why did it take so long to drag the true financial picture — if it is the final picture — from the banks?  Why have the banks on the neighbouring island returned to profitability, one by one, while our banks remain paralysed?</p>
          <p eId="para_234">A journalist who appeared on a programme late last night complained about my party leader raising a question last week with regard to the solvency of the banks.  The journalist in question stated that this was an old story.  It is not an old story.  My party leader's question was posed in the immediate aftermath of the "Freefall" programme, which was broadcast on RTE and which highlighted the fact that representatives from Anglo Irish Bank had approached Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks plc confessing that their institution was insolvent and requesting that one or the other take it over.  The question Deputy Gilmore put to the Taoiseach was both timely and necessary, particularly in the context of establishing whether the Government knew Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The entire purpose of NAMA was to strip out the toxic loans, recapitalise the banks and restart the flow of credit to business and households.  Two years on, this has not happened.  I was approached yesterday by representatives from a company based in the United States which had a request for €90,000 in credit to allow it to establish a facility here turned down by one of the main banks.  I have passed the information relating to the case on to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The contributions to this debate and to that relating to the extension of the ELG scheme from Fianna Fáil Members have been characterised by two themes: first, attack the Labour Party's refusal to give the blanket guarantee a blank cheque; and, second, take shelter behind the new Governor of the Central Bank, the first non-Fianna Fáil public appointee in 13 years.  If Fianna Fáil is so insistent on the canonisation of Professor Patrick Honohan, why did it not appoint him Governor in 2001?  It is likely that if Professor Honohan had been appointed in 2001, the appalling dereliction of duty that contributed to the calamity that has befallen us would have been largely avoided.  Unfortunately, Professor Honohan's sagacity was only recognised in hindsight.  Why was he not consulted after the fall of Northern Rock and before the fateful night of 29 September 2008?</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Fianna Fáil hangs on for dear life to misrepresenting the Honohan report.  All the Fianna Fáil BlackBerrys have been programmed to read "The Honohan Report endorses the blanket guarantee".  Of course, it did nothing of the kind.  The Honohan report concluded that by 29 September 2008, some form of guarantee was inevitable.  No one disputes that by that fateful night, some form of guarantee was necessary.  The question is what happened between the fall of Northern Rock and 29 September 2008, a period of more than one year?</p>
          <p eId="para_238">What Professor Honohan states in his report is remarkably blunt: "No other country had introduced a blanket, system-wide guarantee".  We have been told by Fianna Fáil speakers in this House there are 43 other countries with a blanket guarantee like ours.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_241">The "no failure" policy also took the question of optimal loss-sharing off the table.  In contrast to most of the interventions by other countries, in which more or less complicated risk-sharing mechanisms of one sort or another were introduced, the blanket cover offered by the Irish guarantee pre-judged that all losses in any bank becoming insolvent during the guarantee period — beyond those absorbed by some of the providers of capital — would fall on the State.  Given the "no failure" policy, a guarantee with its costs were inevitable.</p>

The facts are we opposed the blanket guarantee and Mr. Honohan is immensely critical, for a serving Governor, of the wisdom of how that guarantee was drawn, and the inaction and dereliction of duty which preceded the night of 29 September.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">If a Minister for Finance had descended from Mars on 29 September 2008, he may well have had no choice but to do what Deputy Brian Lenihan did if we leave out matters such as the inclusion of dated subordinated debt, which he should not have done.  The Minister for Finance did not descend from Mars on 29 September that year so the question is what happened since people on the streets of this city were seeking to withdraw money from Northern Rock more than 12 months earlier.  No action was taken by the Minister for Finance's predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, and that put us into that position on 28 September.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">The Honohan report continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_251">The scope of the Irish guarantee was exceptionally broad.  Not only did it cover all deposits, including corporate and even inter-bank deposits, as well as certain asset-backed deposits and senior debt, it also included ... certain subordinated debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">It continues to indicate "The inclusion of subordinated debt in the guarantee is not easy to defend against criticism."</p>
          <p eId="para_253">It is difficult to imagine how a serving Central Bank Governor could be more critical.  It is cynical in the extreme for Government speakers who know better to attempt to misrepresent the Honohan report.  One Member, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, even still clings publicly to the explanation that the crash is due to the Lehman Brothers collapse — an explanation that gets short shrift in the Honohan report.  Professor Honohan notes that "a detailed review of the ensuing discussions is hampered by the absence of an extensive written record of what transpired."  We know that to be the case from the Committee of Public Accounts papers, as there are significant gaps and much of what transpired is not recorded at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">As a result we do not know to this day who advised the Taoiseach and the Finance Minister on that fateful night of 29 September 2008 to give a blanket guarantee.  We know, as the Honohan report records, that "the note prepared the previous weekend by the Merrill Lynch advisers had explicitly envisaged exclusion of dated subordinated debt from the coverage".  We know from the Committee of Public Accounts papers that Merrill Lynch did not recommend a blanket guarantee.  Further, it seems to be the case that the officials in the Department of Finance did not recommend a blanket guarantee.  The Taoiseach told the House that any cost attaching to the blanket guarantee would be borne by the sector but Merrill Lynch had pointed out — and it is a point corroborated in the Honohan report — that the cost of borrowing "would likely be affected by the contingent liability, estimated at over €400 billion, associated with the guarantee".</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Most pertinently, the Honohan report records on page 119 that "as the discussions regarding procedures for crisis containment started to unfold, early on a clear consensus view emerged that no Irish Bank should be allowed fail".  The report goes on to instance that there is no such prescription in the textbook.  It states: "This strong view departed from the textbook view that only systemically important institutions should be candidates for such protective treatment".  This decision that no bank could fail was the major influence on the decision taken on the fateful night on 29 September 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">In ease of the Government, may I put on the record Professor Honohan's conclusion.  He states: "Given the position the authorities found themselves in on that night it is understandable why, given the extreme time pressures, all efforts were devoted to finding an immediate way to save the Irish banking system from looming disaster."  I said at the time in this House that the Minister for Finance was put in a position analogous to the bomb disposal expert; he had a blue wire and a red wire and he could not afford to cut the wrong one.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The question remains of why the Minister for Finance found himself in that position.  Why did the regulatory and administrative systems allow the Minister for Finance to be placed there?  Why did his predecessor allow Deputy Lenihan to be put in that position?  What was going on between the collapse of Northern Rock some 12 months earlier and 29 September 2008?  What was going on between the March share price collapse and September date?  Even allowing for regulatory capture, how could the Minister for Finance of the day allow such a potentially explosive position to build up?</p>
          <p eId="para_258">According to the Honohan report, "There is no doubt that from mid 2007 onwards Ireland increasingly faced a potentially serious financial crisis."  It is an injustice to the Governor of the Central Bank, who has been hauled in <i>in extremis</i> to try to restore this country’s reputation internationally, to be so misrepresented, along with his report, in this House.  He makes the point in the report that as far back as the 2004 Financial Stability Report, the following position obtained.  That report notes: “The risk of a substantial fall in residential property prices ... is the risk that poses the greatest potential threat to the health of the financial system.”  That was in 2004, and the Minister for Finance was being warned about the threat posed to the health of the financial system.  Such warnings were ignored.  What action was taken?  We continued the tax incentives, opened new ones and extended others.  When such a warning did not immediately materialise, it induced a complacency that can only be equated with grave dereliction of duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The examination by the Committee of Public Accounts shows clearly that towards the end not even the Department of Finance believed the story that we were dealing only with a liquidity crisis.  Yet, between the failure of Northern Rock and the fateful night of 29 September 2008, the then Minister for Finance and later Taoiseach took no effective action.  He failed to send anyone into the banks to stress-test the veracity of their assertions.  Twenty years from now historians and economists will still be attempting to measure the sheer scale of that dereliction of duty.  Deputy Seán Power is correct: the Taoiseach is haunted by his knowledge of the responsibility he bears for that dereliction of duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">A generation of our people will pay the price for this.  It is not yet clear if our economic sovereignty will survive the consequences.  Now the talk is of consensus, shared analysis and mock humility.  The analysis is in the Honohan report.  In no other country in the world would the same politicians be still in charge.  There can be no recovery until they are gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">In 1997, Fianna Fáil and its Progressive Democrats allies inherited an economy in surplus.  Twelve years later the economy is bust, our society broken.  For a dozen years, those at the top of Fianna Fáil lived high on the hog because they thought they were worth it — Deputies Cowen, Martin, Dermot Ahern, Dempsey, Ó Cuív, O'Donoghue and O'Dea.  Today their reputations are in shatters, their legacy turned to dust.  Some of them are so delusional they will fight their seats again while others will slink away into obscurity.  The damage they have done will be reviled wherever green is worn.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Obscurity would be a fitting end when compared to the unseemly antics of the man who presided over them.  To end up in a Rupert Murdoch cupboard is the final insult to a people who gave him a lot of rope.  Members may remember the note scribbled to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, before the 2002 general election by Fianna Fáil adviser Marty Whelan: "I think our friends in the <i>News of the World</i> still like us, Taoiseach.  I suggest you drop them a thank you note.”  With O’Reilly and Murdoch supporting him, he thought he was unbeatable.  Indeed, he was.  Now, it is payback time with the former leader of the republican party ending up playing hide-and-seek in a television advertisement for a British tabloid.  One could not make it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">There can be no recovery until they are gone.  To hell with phoney consensus.  We need a fresh start.  We need a new Government with a mandate, not some behind-closed doors formula for paralysis.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I thank Deputy Rabbitte for an informative and in-depth statement on Black Thursday.  That was a day none of us with a fair number of years in this House will ever forget.  It was a dark day for the people.  While many of us knew and understood what was coming, many ordinary people believed some newspaper reports that the economy had turned the corner and there was some hope.  Black Thursday, however, ensured that not just the next generation, but the following generation will pay for the Government's economic mismanagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I accept international factors played a part in the current economic crisis.  It is plain, however, that much of what happened in this country was as a direct result of what happened in the Fianna Fáil Galway races tent between builders, bankers and former regulators.  They were all in it together.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">When one looks back at what was allowed happen in the past ten years, it did not make sense building 90,000 housing units a year for a population of 4.5 million.  In the Cavan-Monaghan constituency I drew attention to how many units were built while no jobs were created.  It never added up.  At the time, we were told that, with the better roads, people could commute to work in Dublin.  Special tax relief for house construction in the Shannon basin, which covered part of my constituency up to Butlersbridge, allowed people to build houses simply because it was a tax benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Unfortunately, few questioned what the outcome of such development would be.  Those that did were told in no uncertain terms by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to go away and commit suicide.  That is the background to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Fine Gael, at all times, has put the country first.  Most Members will recall the Tallaght strategy when the country was on its knees.  We put it first then.  When the Taoiseach asked the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, to back the bank guarantee, he did so accepting the Taoiseach's word on the state of the banks.  Unfortunately, we now know much more important and revealing information about the true state of the banks was not made available to Fine Gael then.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I recall during the BSE crisis sitting in the benches behind the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Ivan Yates.  He was doing his damnedest to save this nation from a major disaster.  All the Fianna Fáil Members could do was introduce a vote of no confidence in him, a man who had been working from seven in the morning to 12 at night and who had the support of the farming organisations which recognised the excellent job he was doing.  I find it hard to take lectures from the Members opposite telling us it is our duty now to bend over backwards for this Government and blindly back its resolution to this economic crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Fine Gael is committed to work with the Government to find out how bad the state of economy really is, but it has another thing coming to it if it thinks we will back it all the way in the decisions it will have to make.  Fine Gael did not cause this problem.  Over the past number of budgets, Deputy Richard Bruton warned much of this was coming but was ignored.  His statement and that of our party leader, Deputy Kenny, on the different agreements were also ignored.  Last but by no means least, when they put forward alternatives to the banking problem they were laughed at and told they did not understand what was happening.  I can assure the House that they did understand what was happening.  They put forward proposals that would have saved this nation billions of euro but instead we were walked into a situation where two banks that are absolutely useless to the future of this country, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, were bailed out to the tune of at least €40 billion.  Imagine what that money would have done for job creation and making sure people could return to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I am not saying Fine Gael's proposals would have got us out of the situation for nothing or that they would have saved €40 billion, but the creation of a bad bank and a good bank would have decreased the costs.  We now know that NAMA will not be a profitable organisation and another €40 billion has possibly gone down the tubes.  It will cost anywhere up to €100 billion to sort out the banking situation, which is equivalent to three years' worth of tax receipts.  We have a major problem on our hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Only this week we have had the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and then, after quite a lot of indecision, the Taoiseach, begging Opposition parties to cover their backs for the mess they have created.  Others advise that we should all work together in the national interest because they do not want to accept responsibility for their decisions.  Working together is something of which we are proud, having done so in the past.  We will not work together to give a blank cheque.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide are now defunct and it is only a matter of time before they are wound down.  In my area, we also have the wind down of ACC, National Irish Bank and Halifax.  The banks available to us to create jobs and retain regional trade are Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank, Irish Permanent and one or two other smaller banks.  It is absolutely essential that these banks are forced to give credit.  They have been underwritten by the taxpayers of the State through Government decisions.  Yet, people are experiencing difficulties in getting their needs looked after.  I make no apology for saying that because I know it first hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Some of the banks are claiming they are giving loans to people but in many cases they are changing working capital or overdraft into longer term loans to help their banking structures.  Small retail businesses are under pressure.  Shops are closing which means that no rates will be paid to local authorities and there is a knock-on effect in terms of jobs being lost.  We need to make finance available to the banks.  Deputy Bruton's proposal would have provided money for such a purpose and guaranteed it could not be used to restructure banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">If the Government is looking for consensus it must accept worthwhile proposals from the Opposition and not laugh at and ignore them.  When one reads a story in a local newspaper about a man or a woman who has not paid a small debt and is heading to jail, one has to ask what has happened to the chairmen and chief executives of banks and institutions.  How are they walking free and enjoying holidays in their homes abroad?  What sort of law is there in this country?  There is one law for the ordinary man or woman and a different one for those with white collars.  This is one of the issues which is annoying a lot of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">As I mentioned earlier, there is a real problem with people who are under pressure and suicide rates have increased.  The road safety campaign has paid off significantly.  We need to ensure those who are under pressure and suffering from depression have access to treatment and can get help because such services are currently being cut off.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">My party leader, Deputy Kenny, and Deputies Bruton and Noonan are putting forward positive proposals to ensure this country can get back on its feet.  The one issue above all else which we must address is job creation.  Tomorrow I will attend a debate on job creation organised by Monaghan Chamber of Commerce.  It is desperately trying to give hope; we are not giving hope to people.  It is a disaster that as a result of our lack of banking structures young people are being forced to leave the country.  If they are left outside the country long enough they will stay there.  As taxpayers we have paid for their education and some other country will benefit.  That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">We not only need to deal with the banking crisis here but we need to put in place genuine structures to ensure people who want to take up employment in this country get the opportunity to do so.  Only yesterday I became aware of a young person who was eligible for a job in a local community but it was found, through some technicality, that the person concerned was not claiming social welfare for a long enough period.  In another case a person was too highly educated for a job.  Where do we go?  Every technicality is being used to stop people who want to work from doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">We need to take a two track approach to this issue.  We need to get our banking structures correct but not at any cost.  We need to ensure that the people who gambled with money in this country take responsibility for their actions.  We have to deal with the matter fairly.  We need to try to get some of those who are on social welfare today back into employment, especially young well-educated people who would be better off working for nothing in firms and allowed to claim social welfare rather than allowing them to rot on the side of the street.  We need to come up with new thinking and a new approach to ensure young people do not suddenly become long-term unemployed and unemployable.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">We have too much to offer in this country.  There are opportunities.  I know some firms that  have the money are increasing output in manufacturing and other industries, which shows that if others that are less fortunate and not as well-established could get the finance they could do the same.  The opportunities are there.  One company beside my home is exporting to 55 countries and is keeping people in work, which is vital.  I know of others who are struggling and who cannot get the money to finance new projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">We have very well educated young people but we are not giving them hope or leadership.  We are making out that this country has no hope for the future.  I came through extremely difficult personal times during the 1980s.  At that time, we paid 23% interest.  Interest is still relatively low if people could only get the money to either stay in or increase their business.  This would be one of the best ways forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I look with awe and fright at what is happening in my constituency with Quinn Direct and the Quinn Group.  At this late stage, I beg the Government to ensure that every possible help is given to ensure these jobs are maintained in these areas.  There are ways and means by which the Government can do this within the law and within the structures.  The Government owns Anglo Irish Bank at present and Quinn Direct is involved in this, or at least its personnel are.  It is not too late to come up with a solution to this issue.  People have put forward with one which can guarantee the best of both worlds, whereby Quinn Group workers can be retained in the main and the taxpayer would not have to pay for the €2.8 billion of personal debt.  I urge that every way be looked at to ensure that the best resolution is found.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">It might be very easy to sell off the insurance company for €1 and state we have no more responsibility for it.  However, we must remember that if this is done the chances of those jobs being retained in Cavan and surrounding counties are very small.  It may also have implications for the greater Quinn Group structure.  I do not contend that the Quinn family did not make major mistakes.  However, when this situation is compared to that of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide and what this is costing the Irish nation in tax then it has to be looked at and dealt with seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I welcome this opportunity to speak on this matter.  Fine Gael will work in a constructive way with the Government but it should not ask us to sign blank cheques.  Too many of them have been signed in the past.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_289">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht seans a thabhairt dom labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo.  Tá cursaí airgeadais na tíre go huafásach ag an nóiméad.  Tá a fhios ag cách conas a tharla sé sin.  B'fhéidir go dtógfaidh mé an seans seo chun leigheas nó dhó ar an gcruachás ina bhfuil an tír seo a mholadh.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I do not propose to describe the situation in which the country finds itself, or to rehearse all of the mistakes made by Fianna Fáil since coming into Government in 1997 when it inherited an economy producing 1,000 jobs per week in export-led ventures.  The problems that arose and the mistakes made are all too well known.  To say that there is a major crisis in the country's finances is to put it mildly.  The announcement on banking by the Minister for Finance on 30 September 2010 underlined the extent of the problem.  There are major concerns now about the country going back to the bond markets in January and how the markets will react in terms of purchasing Irish bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">There have been reports recently of what could be a win-win situation for the Exchequer and the ailing private pension schemes in the country.  It is reported that up to €20 billion from the private pension schemes is available for investment in State bonds.  If that €20 billion, or a large portion of it, was invested in State bonds it would ease the national debt crisis and help the troubled pension schemes return to solvency.  The funds in the pension schemes are invested in bonds issued by eurozone Governments, mainly Germany and France.  However, the very low yields on these bonds, somewhere between 2% and 3%, has caused many of the pension funds to move into deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">According to the Pensions Board, 75% of the country's defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit.  The liabilities of the schemes was €45 billion at the end of 2008 but the assets to meet the liabilities are of the order of €32 billion.  This means there is a substantial €13 billion gap, and regulators have given the pension schemes until the end of November to submit plans for tackling the problem.  The problem of the pensions fund needs to be immediately addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I understand that representatives of the pension industry have met officials in the Department of Finance with a view to switching more of their reserves into Irish bonds, with the yields on ten year bonds now hitting 7%.  The facilitating by the Department of Finance of the switching of funds would seem to me to be very well worth considering positively.  I understand there is considerable support for switching the pension scheme funds to Irish bonds but that the industry is seeking further guarantees.  I call on the Minister and the Government to look at this issue as positively as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">At the time Waterford Crystal went into receivership, it was starkly and forcibly brought home to me that there is a major need for a pension security fund to be put in place.  There is such a scheme in Britain but because there no such scheme in Ireland pensioners remain vulnerable.  Although to some extent this is a separate issue, and one which would require that the fund be self-financing, it is an urgent matter and is directly connected with the proposal for the pensions industry to move major funds into Irish Government bonds issued by the National Treasury Management Agency.  This would also have the effect of securing the future of pensioners and would reduce the pressure on employers to come up with additional funds to plug the shortfalls in their pension schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">A forecast based on calculations made last February reckons that investing in high yield Irish bonds would increase the value of pension funds from 40 cent to 60 cent in the euro for a typical pension scheme.  Irish Government bonds are yielding far more now than they did last February.  This proposal has the attraction of using the fallout from one major national problem to substantially solve another.  I realise technical issues are involved and that issues need to be resolved but surely it makes very good sense to proceed down this road quickly given the possibilities that may arise when the pension funds go back to the regulators with their plans for returning their funds to solvency.  The situation where pension funds are terminated and thereby people lose their rights, or their rights are substantially reduced or their return is substantially reduced, should be avoided at all costs.  This has a bearing on the level of concern about how the markets will react when the Government goes back to the bond markets after Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The first priority, in terms of solving the financial crisis which presently faces the country is job creation.  Recently, I was made aware of the following situation in my constituency by an employer in the tree servicing industry who took on five persons in 2009, three of whom were off the live register and two of whom had lost their jobs recently and moved back into employment with this employer.  He met a person who was an unemployed tradesman and this person asked him for employment.  He was impressed by the man and decided to take him on.  This involved the young man having to undertake a course because he could not enter the industry without this basic qualification.  The employer paid £912 to bring in a trainer and an assessor from Northern Ireland so that the person involved could get a City &amp; Guilds qualification and thereby be qualified to enter the industry.  The course took one week and when the person taking the course went to collect the jobseeker's allowance with a letter from his employer outlining that he had been training, he was denied it.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">This is appalling.  Surely all Departments and State agencies should be assisting in every possible way the unemployed to get employment.  Employment in the tree servicing industry entails hard work.  It is difficult work, but it pays quite well.  I have been informed by the employer concerned that there is potential to create some 1,500 jobs in this sector nationally but that employers need assistance to cover the basic training costs and this is not forthcoming from the Government.  Investment in job creation is what the Government must prioritise.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">There is a considerable need to set up a university in my area of the south east.  The south east is under performing in many ways and there is a need to provide within the region the research and development facilities, the graduate cohort and the fourth level education so that it can compete for the kind of employment that is coming on stream.  In a recent letter to me, Mr. Barry O'Leary, chief executive, IDA Ireland, referring to potential companies, stated that IDA Ireland is fully committed to securing a balanced and regional development which includes the south east region, that the challenge is achieving an even spread of investment because the intensification of the sophistication of investments increases, and that they require a high concentration of a highly qualified and educated workforce, supporting infrastructure and high-level business services.  Surely this highlights the urgent need for a university of the south east, with its hub campus in Waterford but with other campuses in other counties in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">There are other ways that the country can be made more competitive.  The Government, through its agencies, must tackle the sheltered sectors of the economy.  Whereas the professions have been hit hard there is the issue of the fees that are charged at the highest levels within the professions.  This is an appalling inequity.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">As we deal with our constituencies and we look at the national question, there are so many issues that require resolution.  We can continually and rightly blame the Government but the greatest blame that rests with the Government is its total inaction in dealing with the issues and problems in the economy that so many people are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">One problem I encounter on a regular basis is the area of mortgages.  There are so many people who now have very difficult problems with their mortgages.  There is a particular issue that keeps coming back to me, that is, how the system treats the self-employed who become unemployed and the difficulty this particular sector encounters in acquiring social welfare payments.  I refer to persons who have paid their taxes, who have employed others and who now have fallen on bad times.  The fact that those who apply for jobseeker's allowance are assessed on their income in 2008 rather than their income last year and in the current year is something that needs to be seriously and immediately addressed.  The mortgage situation, which I mentioned earlier, and the restrictions on access to the mortgage subsidy, are matters that need to be revised and dealt with quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Clean energy is an area which the Government is not addressing sufficiently.  A representative of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, whom I listened to lecturing recently, put it that over a 15 year period 100,000 jobs can be created in Ireland based on clean energy.  The Government, unfortunately, not only on this front but on so many fronts, appears to be paralysed in terms of ideas and initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">There is no denying we are in a very difficult situation, albeit one created in the main by this Government but we will not get out of it unless we tackle it.  There is still some doubt as to the full extent of the banking debt.  We got the figures on 30 September and the measures being put in place to deal with that have been rehearsed to us but there is still the issue of credit for small businesses.  The public service system, which is not fast enough in terms of delivery and is tied up in all sorts of red tape, is not fit for purpose to deal with the current economic situation.  There are many fine people working in the public service but their ability is being under-utilised because they are locked in with methodologies and systems that give no scope for exercising in full the many abilities they possess.  What is the Government doing to address this?</p>
          <p eId="para_304">We need to see a great deal more internship schemes.  It is frightening the number of people who have succeeded in getting good third level qualifications, cannot get employment and are leaving our shores.  Unfortunately many of them will not return.  Certainly, they will not return in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">New graduates need to get job experience.  There is little scope for them to acquire that.  If a new graduate seeks employment, one of the first questions he or she will be asked is what practical experience he or she has.  There is a major need for the introduction of a widespread internship scheme across the economy in the public and private sector.  We would not want such a scheme to be exploited by unscrupulous employers who might use it to replace existing employees or not employ people on a full-time basis.  Graduates could be taken on, retain their social welfare benefit with a top up to some level, and assigned to a position where they would do real work which would expand their qualifications, give them experience in the field and make them more fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The basic issue of the dignity of work, namely, having a reason to get out of bed in the morning, feeling that one is useful and is doing a useful job on behalf of the community, needs to be considered in this context.  It is terribly demoralising to be looking for employment when there are no jobs.  When people apply for jobs, they get refusals or do not get any response, they are not called for any interviews and then they begin to doubt themselves.  Therefore, it is important for new graduates to be in the workplace, doing something useful, albeit on a scheme that is temporary in nature because of the current economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">We have to do much more than talk about our great potential — our magnificent young educated workforce, which we still have although many young people are now leaving the country.  We must show our young people that we value them by giving them an opportunity to get into the workplace where they can develop their skills, gain experience and avail of opportunities when the upturn comes.  We need to show them they are a useful part of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I encourage the Government to get down to the job of turning things around on the jobs front.  A figure that sticks out in everybody's mind is that for everyone who comes off the live register there will be a saving in terms of welfare benefit and a recoupment in tax payment and the gain to the Exchequer will be approximately €20,000 per year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_309">I wish to refer to some of the previous points made during this debate.  I listened to some of the debate last week and the catchcry from the Government benches was that we should forget about the past and only look to the future.  Backbencher and backbencher said that we need to give up being angry because anger is not a policy that we need.  That was said the same day that the gentleman from the west drove his concrete mixer into the gates of Leinster House.  Despite what we may say about him he certainly struck a chord with many people who feel that anger is probably the only outlet they have and want their anger to turn into meaningful action.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Another point that has been made is that everyone must share the pain.  Anger is a very good place to start in developing a policy that will ensure that €50,000 million is never again robbed from the Irish people because of a complete failure to control rampant capitalism.  That is basically what happened.  There was a complete failure to control the extreme elements of uncontrolled capitalism at its worst.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">We must understand why people are so angry.  We must also understand why people say: "Why should we share the pain at the levels the Government appears to want to make us share it?"  Poor people did not cause this crisis, neither did families whose sons and daughters are now likely to put down their roots in faraway shores.  We must start at the top with those people who can afford to pay.  There are still loopholes in the system whereby people who earn the highest amounts of money and have the most wealth still do not pay their share; they still get away with doing that because of tax breaks.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Before I proceed to talk about the general issues of finance, taxation and banking, I wish to refer to an area that is in my brief, that of the co-located hospital project.  Incredibly that project is still on the table and it carries a 41% tax relief for developers.  The Minister for Health and Children indicated in the Dáil recently that she still intends to go ahead with some of the planned co-located hospitals.  This is despite the fact that her expert group on the financing of the health services clearly stated that we have enough private beds in the system already.  Yet she proposes to go ahead with the plan to provide private beds and to use taxpayers' money to give tax breaks to the rich developers who intend to develop those hospitals.  That is an example of where the people at the top will be facilitated with tax breaks for something that we do not need while the people at the bottom, those on low incomes, are now likely to be brought into the tax net.  People in receipt of social welfare benefits, carers and people with disabilities are being asked to pay because the Government says that everyone must share the blame.  The Labour Party believes that the Government should start at the top and when we are in government we will start at the top; it will be the people at the top who will start to bail us out and not the people at the bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">In terms of learning from the past, I cite the example of Germany.  It went through two world wars, both of which it lost, but it has learned from what it went through, which it caused to a great extent, in terms of how it has structured its economy and society.  The Germans have certainly learned lessons from their history.  Germany has developed into one of the strongest European economies and also managed to absorb East Germany without too much disruption to its economy and its society.  The Germans value their service and other services, the importance of solidarity and of engaging with the public and ensuring that extreme elements do not take over.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">This republic is fairly young, but if we do not learn from what has been the biggest crisis in our history, the mistakes that were made will be repeated.  The most important job we have to do as public representatives at this time in our history is to ensure that we learn from the lessons of what happened to our Celtic tiger economy and that we do not allow what happened to ever happen again.  If we do not learn those lessons, we are in danger of the same cyclical behaviour happening again, the same money-grabbing people will again try to use the wealth of the country for their individual benefit.  We need to develop the qualities of solidarity and a sense of society and economy that is about us all sharing in what we want for this country.  We must learn from what happened in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Therefore, we must take note of what Professor Honohan said and not take only a simplistic view of it.  He made it clear that the decision to bring in a blanket guarantee was not the result of a sudden crisis but followed months of meetings led by the Department of Finance.  It is simply inconceivable that the Minister and the Taoiseach were not briefed on what was happening at the time, yet they brought in the blanket guarantee.  The Labour Party is proud to have opposed it.  There are many elements of that blanket guarantee that are now haunting us in a huge way. In regard to subordinated debt Professor Honohan also stated: "Given that the whole point of subordinated debt is to be a form of risk-absorbing capital, and as such is sold as being explicitly more risky than senior bonds, it would have been reasonable to argue that subordinated debt holders should not be exempt from possible losses; as far as can be determined, no guarantee offered by any other government during the crisis covered such risk-bearing liabilities."</p>
          <p eId="para_316">He also referred to the note prepared by Merrill Lynch which observed that the assumption of such a large contingent liability would have an adverse effect on borrowing costs for the State.  Despite clear warnings, the Government proceeded with the blanket guarantee.  As a result, enormous sums of money will be transferred to future taxpayers and the Labour Party and Fine Gael, the two parties that will presumably form the next Government, will be bound by certain undertakings.  There is no doubt that the mistakes made in this area contributed significantly to the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Another reason for our current problems was the lack of regulation which allowed the banks to get away with murder.  It is a disgrace that the banks lent such large sums of money to individuals, frequently in the knowledge that the loans in question were tied up with and backed by other loans from other lending institutions for other properties.  This responsibility for the tangled mess that has ensued lies with the Financial Regulator, Central Bank, Department of Finance and banks, specifically their boards, risk management experts and senior managers.  That some of these individuals continue to hold positions in the banks is a disgrace, which the Minister should address.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">On the issue of the banks making money available to businesses, I will refer to a response to a parliamentary question I received from the Minister for Finance on 3 February this year.  One of the major problems with the banks is that they have taken our money and used it for their own purposes by shoring up assets and improving liquidity.  We were informed that the purpose of the bank bailout and National Asset Management Agency was to safeguard the stability of the State and provide money for small businesses to reactivate the economy and maintain and create jobs.  In his reply on 3 February, the Minister for Finance stated the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_319">Under the NAMA legislation I will shortly be issuing guidelines to all banks participating in NAMA who lend to SMEs, to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the banks.  The purpose of this measure is to ensure that the benefits of NAMA lead to an improved flow of credit to viable businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">He indicated he would establish a review system and use the information it provided.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs.  This will help me to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">This statement was made in early February this year yet Deputies from all sides are still being contacted daily by individuals who run viable businesses or are setting up new businesses and cannot obtain credit.  Many of them have done the necessary research and know their plans are viable.  One man who contacted me has found a market for his product in Britain.  He attended the relevant trade fairs in the UK and secured orders for his product, for which he has also drawn up a design.  Despite investing redundancy money he received from a previous job in the product, he is unable to secure further capital from the banks.  This is a major problem for many other people with viable products and the owners of businesses which are likely to go out of business without credit.  What has changed since the Minister for Finance gave an undertaking to make credit flow for small businesses?</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I am pleased to note the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is present as I propose to raise a number of issues related to housing and local government.  Limerick city, like many other cities, has a large number of empty shops.  One of our local newspapers recently compared the position of Galway to that of Limerick.  While we tend to regard Galway as a thriving city, the survey revealed that it has as many empty shops as Limerick and the same is probably true of other cities, towns and villages.  Premises are empty for a variety of reasons, including the Government's refusal to support the Labour Party Bill which would have abolished upward only rent reviews.  Shops are also closing because their owners cannot secure money to tide them over in these hard times.  Shops are the lifeblood of cities and towns in that they provide employment and their closure has a negative impact on the surrounding economy and community.  People no longer want to travel into city centres if they are not vibrant.  I urge the development of a plan to enable local authorities to assist in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The opera centre in another part of Limerick city was a major plan by one of the large developers to develop a site in the city centre.  The developer in question bought out many small shops, some of which moved elsewhere while others did not re-open.  The project then collapsed.  I am not sure if it has been transferred to the National Asset Management Agency but if not, it will probably transfer at a later date.  The area in question, which is in the centre of the city, is now an eyesore.  Where once we had thriving small shops and other businesses, we now have a large empty space.  Limerick City Council is trying to produce a plan for the area but does not have cash available to take action.  The Government should assist in this regard, albeit not necessarily by providing money.  It should at least ensure the banks are more free with their money.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The Labour Party has proposed establishing a strategic investment bank using €2 billion of the National Pension Reserve Fund and additional funds secured from other sources.  While the State owns a number of banks and has large stakes in several others, the established banks have their own ways of doing things.  If we started afresh with a new strategic investment bank, we would be able to achieve the outcomes we seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The concept of the solidarity bond could also be developed.  While I welcomed the establishment of the bond, I note it has not been advertised as a means of allowing people to be patriotic by investing money in bonds that would be used to fund positive developments.  Perhaps we should introduce a diaspora bond aimed at those from other countries who have Irish origins and have made money.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The Government had a big bash in Farmleigh recently which attracted a large number of participants.  It should use this concept to encourage people to invest in Ireland.  Perhaps individuals could be allowed to choose where they wished to invest.  For example, a person from County Limerick who emigrated to the United States and made good there could decide he wants to invest in an enterprise under development in Limerick.  He could then ask the Government to facilitate his wish through some form of bond system.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">If we are to pull ourselves out of recession, we must begin to think in such imaginative ways and use what is positive about this country.  The problem for people who have ideas and want to rebuild the economy is that the Government is preoccupied with fiscal balance.  Last year, its focus was on the banks and this year it is focused on achieving fiscal balance at the expense of job creation.  People despair when they see money being taken out of the economy because it means there will be less to spend.  We must find ways of bringing money into the economy, whether from domestic or overseas sources, some of whom may wish to provide money in a spirit of good will or out of a desire to stand by the Republic, if I can use that phrase given that the individuals in question may no longer live in the Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">In addition to activating money, we must activate people.  Many of our young people are out of work, an issue discussed by Deputy O'Shea.  Some of them are moving abroad and putting down roots elsewhere.  I heard a programme recently about the Dubai women's Gaelic football team.  Two of the women interviewed were physiotherapists who had to moved to Dubai because they could not secure employment here.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">They had been obliged to go to Dubai because they could not get a job here.  It is not so many years ago that it was decided to deal with a shortage of physiotherapists by providing additional courses in universities but they are now playing on the Dubai ladies' football team.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">This is what is happening under the Government policy, which is the reason a different approach must be adopted.  We must attempt to keep young people in Ireland and find ways to employ them.  In this regard the Labour Party has proposed a jobs scheme.  While I acknowledge the Government has set up one or two schemes, it appears to want to hide them.  There is a jobs placement scheme under FÁS and a graduate placement scheme but it is very hard to find out about them.  Moreover, I am informed by employers that it is very hard to register on the scheme indicating one's desire to place a graduate in one's business.  The graduates involved do not receive any additional money but simply get their dole payments.  They must also be unemployed for three months and a number of other conditions also apply.  However, it is as though the scheme does not exist as one never hears anyone talking about it.  The new scheme, announced recently by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, appears to be very similar to the scheme that is already in place about which no one appears to know anything.  One must be serious about wanting to get people back to work.  One must facilitate them to so do and must provide them with opportunities of this kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I also wish to make a point I have raised previously in the Chamber about county and city enterprise boards running out of money.  I was approached by a person who had an Internet business, already employed a small number of people but wished to employ more.  He had applied to the Limerick city enterprise board and was approved, only to be told subsequently that the board had no money.  Although he had fulfilled the criteria, the enterprise board had no money to give him.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It is crazy for an enterprise board not to have enough money for a viable enterprise in the current economic climate.  Whatever else might face cutbacks, the Government should allow enterprise boards at least enough money to fund ideas which the boards consider will create wealth and jobs because we will be in deep trouble unless we begin to mind and nourish ideas for job creation.  We cannot simply continue to rely on multinationals and so on but must encourage indigenous Irish industries and ideas.  While there are many campus projects and people with ideas, the task is to match such ideas with money and support.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">This very useful debate has been going on for some time and is drawing to a conclusion.  All these issues are closely linked.  Many Members have spent much of their time discussing issues such as enterprise and activation, which are closely linked to the banking crisis because enterprises cannot get going or cannot remain open in the case of shops and businesses precisely because the banks are starving them of money.  The Government should keep an eye on the broader picture, on the suffering of the people and on the need to give them hope and opportunity.  Rather than simply focusing on one issue at a time, that is, first on banking and now on the fiscal crisis they must all be considered together and the people must be given some positives for the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_191">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_335">I am pleased, in my renewed position as a member of the parliamentary Labour Party, to be able to speak on the banking crisis and the financial situation.  Since the outset of this crisis, when the Labour Party stood alone to oppose the blanket bank guarantee, I have always strongly opposed the entire approach of the Government and especially its policy of bailing out the casino banks, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  These two institutions were not and are not of systemic importance to the Irish banking system and as institutions they behaved recklessly and criminally for the benefit of a small nexus of cronies.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The approximate €50 billion bank bailout figure announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, last Thursday week was horrific.  Many people are still trying to understand how the toxic triangle of developers, bankers and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politicians has got us into such a mess that the Government intends to pour €29 billion to €35 billion into Anglo Irish Bank, €5.4 billion into Irish Nationwide, perhaps €11 billion into AIB, €3.5 billion into Bank of Ireland — one may not have heard the entire story in that regard — and €350 million into the Educational Building Society.  A few weeks ago, a Sunday newspaper estimated the full costs of the systemic bailout to be between €45 billion and €55 billion for the recapitalisation and perhaps €45 billion for NAMA.  When added together, this provides a possible total cost of €100 billion.  In addition, the impact on the national debt is staggering, as the general deficit will hit 32% of GDP for 2010, even though only a few months ago, the Taoiseach was in this Chamber blathering on about how to cope with a debt of 20% of GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The question being asked by all Members' constituents is whether the mind-blowing figures announced on black Thursday constitute the final reckoning.  The key concern of everyone observing Members today is whether this is the bottom line on how much the Irish banking sector will need.  All the Minister's previous estimates have turned out to be wildly incorrect, misleading, inaccurate and sometimes simply downright lies.  Consequently, why or how can citizens accept this latest forecast to be definitive?  A number of months ago, a financial analyst informed me of his belief that the bailout losses would be approximately €50 billion at a time when the Minister was still insisting they would reach a maximum of €35 billion.  Moreover, banking expert Mr. Peter Mathews also has mentioned an incredible figure of €65 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">As there are so many basic pieces of information about which Members have no hard data, the Minister should respond to the questions I am about to pose.  How much will the promissory notes cost each year into the future?  What about the exclusion from NAMA of the loans between €5 million and €20 million?  Will the €7 billion of debt represented by these smaller loans not act as a deadweight on AIB and Bank of Ireland for decades to come?  Will Ireland end up as another Japan over the next two decades, that is, treading water, barely trying to keep going and with a national debt of 200% of GDP?  What impact will the Hallowe'en deadline for NAMA transfers have on the figures?  The original intention was to work through them carefully and slowly but it now must be done within two or three weeks and surely the entire point of NAMA was to examine forensically every bad loan.  Will even more surprises emanate from NAMA after 31 October?  Its chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, now appears to be stating that the final figure will not be known until February 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told Members that one of the key objectives of NAMA was to remove the toxic loans from the banks' balance sheets and to get liquidity back into the system.  However, the bigger than expected discounts that NAMA is now applying to loans mean that the banks need much bigger sums of public money for their recapitalisation.  Only yesterday, the Minister informed me that the interest figure for 2010 will be approximately €300 million less than the €5 billion he indicated to Members earlier this year.  However, he stated that next year, it will be between €6.7 billion and €7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">This means that a huge chunk of national taxation will go down the tube month after month into the vortex of this horrible disaster.  If this is the true picture of how profoundly damaged is the Irish banking system, why is this only being found out two years down the road?  Banks in the United Kingdom, which adopted a completely different policy in 2008, are already returning to profitability.  The Labour Party urged early action to clean up the banks and to restore liquidity for businesses and households but what we got instead were two disastrous wasted years with soaring unemployment, emigration and misery because of the constant dissembling and gross incompetence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The Fianna Fáil-Green Party bank bailout has been characterised by constant misinformation and uncertainty about the true state of the banks.  Incidentally, as I have stated a number of times at the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Finance has proved itself to be not fit for purpose.  Clearly, it has a major role in the banking and economic collapse through its total failure to undertake effective economic forecasting, effective strategic plans — Deputy Reilly mentioned that point this morning — or to even moderately invigilate the banks.  Shortly after the 2007 election, I asked that Mr. Neary, the then Financial Regulator, be invited before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain himself because I believed there was a fundamental problem with the banks.  Mr. Neary appeared before the committee and told its members an outrageous pack of lies about the stability of the banking sector in early 2008.  While a member of the aforementioned committee up to a few months ago, I read out what he had to say and every line he told members was rubbish, nonsense and lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Although Professor Brian Lucey first raised the issue of the lack of legislation permitting subordinated bondholders to share in the losses unless the senior bondholders are in default and a bank is in a special form of parliamentary proceedings, Members did not hear this on black Thursday.  We had to wait for several days until Brian Lucey told us in <i>The Irish Times</i> that additional legislation was required.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, did not seem to have any idea from his briefing with the Department of Finance that there was a major problem in regard to subordinated bondholders and so on.  Despite repeated statements to the contrary by various embattled Ministers, Professor Honohan’s report does not categorically find that a blanket guarantee was necessary.  While he stated that it could be helpful in certain circumstances, he did not conclude that it was essential.  Moreover, he questioned such a commitment to senior bondholders.  That crazy decision was an act of criminal behaviour against Irish citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">It was amusing this morning to hear the leader of Sinn Féin speak about being a party in opposition.  The Labour Party was the only party in opposition in September 2008 when our 19 Deputies voted against the blanket guarantee in this Chamber.  How can we have any trust in a system that is still largely administered by the senior bankers, Ministers, accountants, auditors and regulators who contributed so much to this catastrophe?</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has often described Anglo Irish Bank as being of systemic importance to the banking system.  Yet he gave the institution a blank cheque in September 2008 without being aware of its true situation.  No evidence was ever produced to support the claim of systemic importance.  A pertinent footnote in Professor Honohan's report considers the notion of a bank guarantee for all the institutions with the exception of Anglo Irish Bank.  Yet we had various Ministers talking to the media who had not even read the report. <i>Phoenix</i> magazine has rightly raised the grave matter of whether the current regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, accepted questionable figures from the board of Anglo Irish Bank in its 2009 annual report.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The folly of the Government's blank cheque approach to Anglo Irish Bank was exposed by the recent decision to split the bank into a so-called funding bank and an asset recovery bank with plans for an eventual wind-down of the failed bank without it ever having positively contributed to economic recovery.  What was the purpose of the Government decision in this case?  The Government continues to refuse to address the responsibility of senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  There is still a strong case to liquidate the bank and its fellow casino institution, the Irish Nationwide Building Society, as quickly as possible and with as little further cost to the Irish people as possible.  We should seek to recover all taxpayer losses from the perpetrators of this disaster.  People ask me every day why Seán FitzPatrick, his fellow directors and senior management have not been prosecuted as would be the case in most other countries.  In the case of the Chilean disaster, for example, the director of the company in question is already in police custody.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government childishly attempted to smear the Labour Party's original banking policy to nationalise temporarily those banks that are of systemic importance, namely, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, in order to protect ordinary depositors and to get credit moving to businesses and householders.  The Black Thursday announcement by the Government reminded me of the famous description by Seamus Mallon of the Good Friday Agreement as "Sunningdale for slow learners".  It took the Government two years to realise there were fundamental problems with Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">According to the Minister, Allied Irish Banks will require capitalisation of at least €11 billion with the result that the State will have 90% ownership of the bank.  If it had been temporarily nationalised two years ago there would have been a lower cost and a reduced risk to taxpayers as well as the opportunity for the State to clear out the senior bankers who made the bank insolvent.  Under a nationalised system the valuation risk is massively reduced as loans can be transferred at market value rather than according to the Minister's fantastical notion of long-term economic value under NAMA.  Both the IMF and the former Swedish Finance Minister, Bo Lundgren — who undertook a very successful temporary nationalisation programme in that country — highlighted this reduced risk factor as one of the most important advantages of nationalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">What has become clear in the past two years is that the appalling practices of the top bankers in Allied Irish Banks must be rooted out once and for all.  That culture must be smashed.  This is particularly imperative given the repeated scandals of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s at the bank.  That so-called distinguished gentleman, Mr. Peter Sutherland, has in recent weeks been lecturing the nation on the need to reduce social welfare provision, education spending and so on.  Is this the same Mr. Sutherland who was chairman of Allied Irish Banks in the 1990s when acts of gross criminality were carried out against taxpayers?  Is it the same Mr. Sutherland who was a director of Royal Bank of Scotland when it had to be bailed out by the British taxpayer for at least €45 billion?  Is it the same Peter Sutherland who was so closely connected to Goldman Sachs, an organisation described by the last British Prime Minister as "guilty of moral bankruptcy", a company which defrauded tens of thousands of American investors with a Ponzi scheme whereby credit derivatives were bundled into packages, floated off and then bet against?  Why should we heed Mr. Sutherland's advice about anything?</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I have the same objections to being offered advice by Mr. Ray MacSharry who, as Minister in the late 1980s, implemented savage cutbacks in services.  Those cuts led to desperate suffering for our most vulnerable citizens some of whom died waiting for hospital treatment.  That was the legacy of the implementation of Mr. Colm McCarthy's first programme of reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">If Allied Irish Banks had been temporarily nationalised two years ago it might not have had to sell its crown jewels in the form of its profitable operations in Poland and the United States.  The Minister should consider the retention of the bank in public ownership as a national "good bank".  We had such a good bank in the 1980s and early 1990s when the State effectively owned the various TSB banks, together with ACC and ICC.  In the 1992 general election, my party proposed a third force or people's bank loosely based on an amalgamation of the three State banks led by TSB.  There is no question that such a model would have worked and would have provided much needed domestic competition to Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">We should explore the possibility of making all 4.25 million citizens equal shareholders in Allied Irish Banks, as one of my constituents constantly advises me.  The British Co-operative Society has a membership, at 5 million, that is larger than the population of this country.  We should take 100% control of Allied Irish Banks and retain it in public ownership for a long time to come.  The Labour Party has also developed proposals for a strategic investment bank to provide credit facilities to small and medium-sized enterprises, invest in innovative companies and take the lead in raising finance for appropriate infrastructural products.  If we lead the next Government we will implement that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Apart from Anglo Irish Bank, the failure of the Government, Central Bank and Financial Regulator to regulate the Irish Nationwide Building Society is one of the greatest financial crimes against the Irish people.  Raising €2.7  billion and paying savage interest on that vast sum for years just to dump it into the black hole of INBS is a criminal policy and an act of treachery against this country.  Constituents ask me all the time why Mr. Michael Fingleton and his directors and senior management have not been prosecuted.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The shocking failure of corporate governance at the Educational Building Society between 2002 and 2008 shows the contempt of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Green Party for mutual institutions.  The EBS board and all its senior executives from the pre-September 2008 era should depart immediately.  Its actions in becoming involved in speculative commercial developments bankrupted this society and betrayed its 600,000 members, of whom I am one.  Those leaders should be investigated by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The Minister for Finance's proposal to sell off the EBS is a profound mistake.  I have already asked him to consider retaining the EBS in State ownership until the Government can establish a strengthened mutual building society and co-operative model.  This new structure could perhaps be based on models such as the John Lewis Partnership or the Banque Populaire in France.  We must take control of the EBS from the bottom up.  Other governments including, surprisingly, the Conservative Party-Liberal Democrats coalition in Britain are examining measures to enhance the role of mutuals and co-operatives in a reformed banking system that prioritises the needs of ordinary households and businesses.  Yet here in Ireland we are privatising the EBS even though it was probably the best organisation in the financial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">One of the broader issues that has been highlighted by the current catastrophic crisis is the rotten mortgage system that has enslaved many of our citizens.  It was amusing this morning to listen to Mr. Peter Bacon speaking to Pat Kenny on the radio.  He spoke on the very important subject of the huge burden of private debt, particularly on young people.  Back-breaking mortgages are crucifying them.  We need to look at the whole mortgage system.  We should have built in a mechanism to alleviate this burden, as was done by some banks in the United States which cut the capital figure.  I welcome the campaign of bodies such as London Citizens, a wonderful organisation, which is trying to address the back-breaking nature of interest payments for many families and individuals in the United Kingdom.  This approach needs to be extended to the Irish mortgage market.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Auditing and accounting firms must also be held to account for their failure to detect and report out-of-control speculative and criminal activity in the banking system.  Why have we not had an investigation of what went wrong in the auditing and accounting industry accompanied by major reforms to make sure it never happens again?  Public confidence needs to be restored in these discredited professions.  An ordinary Joe Soap would be sacked if he failed so abysmally to carry out his key work functions and responsibilities.  Instead, the big four auditing and accounting firms, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte, and many other legal, accounting and auditing companies are allowed to carry on their merry way.  Not alone that, they are at the heart of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party bank bailout strategy and paid millions.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The law firm, Arthur Cox, for example, which was up to its neck in advising Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland on property deals, was, rightly, named by <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> as one of the untouchables which caused the financial crisis, yet, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General, this company earned €3.9 million between September 2008 and June 2009 for advising the Government on the State bank guarantee, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  A Greek citizen, who is a certified auditor, contacted Members of the House to ask how, if Anglo Irish Bank’s accounts were certified by auditors, it went on to collapse.  Another person e-mailed me yesterday and signed himself “yours in despair”.  He asked why Goldman Sachs is so heavily involved in Irish affairs, given its toxic role in the domestic and international financial crash.  I have already referred to the unbelievable vapourings of Mr. Peter Sutherland.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I have already mentioned <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> listing of 20 untouchables.  It is outrageous that so many people mentioned on this shameful list are still in their positions, yet a number of members of this group, including senior civil and public servants, may wonder how they are part of the group while their political masters in Fianna Fáil and the PDs are nowhere to be seen, except, perhaps, in cupboards advertising the <i>News of the World</i>.  <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> list is like Hamlet without the prince.  The princes in this case are five politicians — three right-wing ideologues: the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, and former Ministers Charlie McCreevy and Michael McDowell and the current and former taoisigh, who are still trying to portray themselves as deluded fools, using the Bart Simpson defence.  The poor former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is still waiting for Mr. Neary or Mr. Hurley to call to tell him the country is going down the tubes and something needs to be done to deal with the economic bubble.  He does not know how this happened.  He is going around the world lecturing people about the peace process.  I accept we were all involved with that, and it is a wonderful achievement, and we were all involved in the Celtic tiger.  It is incredible nonsense to tell us he is waiting for that call.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">It is also more than a little disturbing, as Senator Shane Ross has noted, that the Minister recruited the architects of the critical valuation system from deep within the toxic banking and property development vortex that helped to create this catastrophe in the first place.  Did the Minister make any effort to recruit valuation experts internationally, especially from states such as Germany or the Netherlands that have had fairly stable property systems for the past decades?  At the height of the property bubble the economist, David McWilliams, wondered how a small terraced house in Dublin 7 or 8 could be worth more than a chateau in southern France or a farm in Munster in central Germany.  How could that have been possible?  It is incredible that the Department of Finance, regulators, taoisigh and Ministers for Finance could not understand that this was an anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The role of the IFSC and its impact on national tax policy and the invasion by foreign banks, like Bank of Scotland, needs to be investigated.  I commend the ordinary staff of banks, some of whom are facing tough futures, who looked after us day in and day out.  They often point to the destabilising role of the off-shore element of the IFSC and how it damaged our larger banks.  They talk, in particular, of the foreign invasion led by Bank of Scotland, which gave mortgages of more than 100%.  Opposition Members raised this matter with the Taoiseach at the time but he did not seem to think he could do anything about it.  Of course, he was only the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Ireland has a structural fiscal deficit but it is the banks and the Fianna Fáil-Green Party blank cheque approach to bailing out banks that has wrecked our fiscal position for the foreseeable future.  In 2009, the budgetary position deteriorated by approximately €11 billion of the €22 billion, simply due to the banking crisis.  Colm McCarthy, and those in the media and the Government who hang on his coat tails, told us, day after day, that we had a deficit of €22 billion.  However, it was the banks that wrecked us, are wrecking us this year and will wreck us next year and the following year.  It is so annoying to have to impose this on ordinary people.  The Fianna Fáil-Green Party slash and burn approach means we will kill the patient in 2011 by totally deflating the economy and facilitating no stimulus measures to tackle the jobs catastrophe and enhance consumer confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">In contrast, the policy of the Labour Party is the correct one.  We have been clearly focusing on jobs and investments through our policies on the strategic investment bank and on investing in SMEs and innovative companies, retraining opportunities, schools, broadband, communications and public transport.  I am a big supporter of major infrastructural investment.  In my own region we have done huge preparatory work on metro north.  Approximately €160 billion has already been spent on the project and it will, I hope, be passed by An Bord Pleanála in a few weeks time.  The immediate preparatory works done next year will be of the order of only €50 million.  As a public private partnership, it will not impose a great immediate cost as we try to get out of the fiscal crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">We can frame a budget for next year.  I believe we should do this year by year and one step at a time.  The guys and girls who got us into this mess should not try to tie us down for four, five or ten years into the future.  We must get out of the mess one step at a time.  With a Keynesian-Paul Krugman approach we would gradually work our way out of the debt and rebuild our country.  The people who are responsible for this, including the politicians, should be held accountable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_365">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am not glad the debate is happening because this is one of the most serious issues I have ever risen to address in my time in this House.  Of course, this is not a debate.  It is a series of statements.  We need to re-assert the relevance of the House and ensure that the sort of clinical analysis provided by my colleague, Deputy Broughan, is responded to in a meaningful way and that the people who are making decisions in the short term are listening and engaging and are required to account.  For the moment, we must put up with statements, where people are at least able to state, for the record, their views on the calamity that has befallen our nation, brought about by a lethal combination of individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I begin my contribution in the middle of the story and make mention of the night of 29 September 2008 when the most calamitous decision ever made by an Irish Government was made.  At that moment, the country was brought to its knees.  The Government has spun a story from that night but it is not even able convince its own backbenchers, as yesterday's comments from Deputy Seán Power on "Morning Ireland" attest.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">In great ignorance calamitous, a decision was taken to sign a blank cheque which turned into a noose around the neck of all citizens and their children yet to be born.  The decision has been spun as being the only thing to do and the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, was spun as confirming the righteousness of the decision even though he did no such thing.  Professor Honohan confirmed the need for an expansive guarantee but the Government provided a blanket guarantee for a black hole of money.  It had no notion of the size of sums involved then and it since made several stabs at arriving at the figure.  We have long sought to determine the cost of that ruinous decision and have been given various estimates.  The latest reply from the Government is that it hopes the final figure will be between €45 billion and €50 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">This ruinous cost is being taken on by the State for a rotten institution called Anglo Irish Bank and a small cabal of developers, ten of whom had loans of between €1 billion and €3 billion.  A lauded group of cowboys was given access to sums of money so vast as to be outside the comprehension of most people.  Most of us are bewildered by the thought of billions of euro but these cowboys were unconditionally given any sum they wanted and for virtually any purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Our problems were crystallised in Anglo Irish Bank.  Profligate bankers, drunk on their capacity to shovel out borrowed money, believed they were masters of the universe and the creators of the Celtic tiger economy.  They lectured all and sundry about their Midas touch.  The political masters were blind to the impending catastrophe and deluded about the function of a real economy.  A small group of politicians centred on the Progressive Democrats and the core of Fianna Fáil believed they could shrink this nation's tax base while at the same time finding sufficient money to fund social provision through a giant pyramid scheme.  The regulators were unfit for purpose.  I recognise they were hobbled by a Government that made clear it did not want to hear from naysayers but despite their substantial salaries they were content to keep their heads down as the tragedy unfolded.  They considered their duties were met by the odd muted suggestion that perhaps matters were getting out of control.  The developers saw they could cosy up to politicians while they invented the perfect money spinning racket.  They were able to access boundless capital from their crony bank and develop any site they wanted with problem free planning permission.  They bid up the price of land to unprecedented levels and nobody said "No".  At the end of the day, they rolled their debts over for profit.  They believed the racket would never end.  Any gobdaw could make a profit, and many did.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The first casualties were the ordinary men and women who wanted to buy homes and start their families.  They were told to move quickly, to queue overnight, and to pay any price in case the homes became more expensive the following day.  The so-called lucky ones who signed up for mortgages when they began their family lives are today saddled with crippling debts, reduced incomes and negative equity.  These were the first casualties but, by God, they were not the last.  The cost of the crisis was not confined to first-time buyers because every man, woman and child is required to pay for the mistakes of an evil and vicious set of people who connived with the Government to bring us to our knees.  This cost will be with us long into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The most offensive phrase, and the one which grates most with people, is: "we are where we are", as if some malevolent external force from Mars brought this proud nation to its current sorry state.  The day is not far away when the people will have the opportunity to hold to account those who were politically responsible.  All the spin in the world will not exonerate their guilt.  The people will make that determination and they cannot be dodged forever.  It will be for others than the people who brought us to this catastrophe to map a way out and to give hope and leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Labour Party will play its part.  We have accepted the economic parameters agreed with the European Commission and will support efforts to reach the deficit target of 3% of GDP by 2014.  We have a clear understanding of the difficulties involved in reaching that target.  We have a track record of doing the right thing in these matters, unlike some whose record is of bringing the economy to its knees on more than one occasion.  I was privileged to serve in Cabinet from 1993 to 1997.    That Government made hard decisions.  Unusually, the very night we received our seals of office on a cold January in 1993, we were briefed by officials from the Department of Finance on the difficult state of the public finances.  That Government and its immediate successor, both of which had a very significant Labour Party component, made hard decisions on expenditure.  I was Minister for Health for its first budget and Minister for the Environment for its second.  They were big-spending Departments and there were big demands placed on them.  The Labour Party made difficult decisions on taxation that had an impact on everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Furthermore, decisions were made on creating jobs, generating growth and creating the potential for the economy not to be crippled.  From an extraordinarily difficult position, the Labour Party helped to map a route to progress.  When we left office in 1997, we had been creating 1,000 new, real sustainable jobs every week.  We left a balance-of-payments surplus behind us for the incoming Government.  The national balance was in credit.  We left behind us an economy built on sound job creation principles that resulted in sustainable jobs, manufacturing jobs and export-driven jobs.  There were affordable houses in respect of which one could calculate one's mortgage entitlement on the basis of one's annual salary.  One could get a maximum of two and a half or three times one's salary.  That was the lie of the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">It was a question of developing social services that could be paid for and sustained.  That is Labour's record.  When people criticise us and say we do not know how to do things or are afraid of hard decisions, they should note we have picked up the broken bits before and assembled a decent economy.  The people know we can do it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Fianna Fáil and its supporters, including the Progressive Democrats and latterly the Green Party, and various so-called Independents, have brought us to a much worse position than we faced in 1992.  However, we will meet that task also.  It is now clear from all the talk of consensus in the past two weeks or so that only a change of Government can bring about the national momentum required to assist us to climb out of the economic hole the Government has cast us into.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Every Member of this House, including me, has been transfixed by the story of the miners' rescue in Chile, particularly in recent days.  The story came to a happy conclusion last night, thank God.  A joyous Chilean President spoke of national unity, common purpose and sheer combined determination to achieve what seemed impossible.  That should be our example.  However, the Chilean effort involved the people; so must ours.  The people must be consulted and decide.  They will not tolerate any political ready-up by any parties in this House, particularly not one that maintained at its core discredited politicians who have brought us to this sorry pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The first aspect of our agenda concerns next year's budget, the second is the budget strategy for the next four years, the third component will be a strategy for jobs, and the fourth will be a strategy for reform.  I want to mention the Labour Party's attitude to each of these elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">With regard to the budget ahead, we said we accepted the need for cutbacks of €3 billion next year.  We will publish our pre-budget statement, as we did last year, outlining how we would achieve that.  It is not rocket science in that there are three components, as always.  First is the issue of capital expenditure, second is the issue of current expenditure and third is the issue of taxation.  Between those three elements, we will determine to find the €3 billion.  Irrespective of whether that figure has now changed, as has been hinted by some Ministers, or whether it is €4.3 billion, as blurted by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, we clearly need to see the figures.  We understand that is now, finally, to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The Labour Party will meet the task and set out its strategy.  With regard to the four-year strategy, it will set out where we should go.  Equally important are the other two elements I mentioned, namely, a strategy for reform and a strategy for jobs.  I do not have time to address them in detail.  We have laid out reams of policy documents on these matters over the past two years, many of which documents have been alluded to by other Labour Party speakers this morning, including Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and Deputy Brian O'Shea.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">We talked about our graduate placement programmes, our strategic investment bank proposal and our loan guarantee scheme.  All these elements and more will be required to achieve the most important objective, namely, jobs for our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The reform agenda will be broad and we will spell it out.  It will include reform of the Oireachtas itself and its functions, as alluded to at the beginning of my speech.  Thus, we will not be talking aimlessly at people who have already written their responses.  I desire an Oireachtas that is in command, that holds people to account and where people are required to respond in a sensible and open way.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Other aspects of the strategy for reform need to be addressed.  I do not have time to allude to them all.  One element is the public service itself, which has fallen down on the job in this regard, as other speakers indicated.  Also to be considered is the regulation system, which goes well beyond the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and Financial Regulator in that it concerns the accounting organisations, the auditing organisations.  We must have fundamental reform of all those in order to restore confidence among the Irish people and those others on whom we depend for support.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The Labour Party will spell out its views on all these critical matters.  All parties have a window of opportunity between now and early next year, during which time this nation will not be going to the bond markets looking for additional capital, to lay out before the people their programmes for growth and development and their fiscal, taxation and reform measures.  It is on this basis that a new Government with a long-term fresh mandate can begin the slow climb to progress that the people demand and provide the leadership and hope they require.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_384">I was surprised when I got a slot in which to speak today.  I knew a number of my Labour Party colleagues were keen to speak and, therefore, I assumed it would be next week or even the following week before I would get a chance to speak.  I then discovered that nobody on the Government side was offering to speak at all.  This seems extraordinary.  This is the most important issue that has faced the country in at least 20 years and this is probably one of the most important sessions in which Members can give their views on the banking catastrophe that has befallen the country, yet nobody on the Government side is offering to speak.  Strangely, very few from the Fine Gael benches have been offering to speak.  That is extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The week before last, when this issue arose, we discussed on the Order of Business the need for adequate time to be allowed to discuss the Minister's statement.  The Labour Party had at that time to battle to get any concession from the Taoiseach in regard to the provision of a decent amount of time for statements.  The Taoiseach in agreeing to this also agreed that time would be allowed, in the usual manner — I recall that was his precise comment — for questions and answers on the conclusion of statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Before I continue, will the representative of the Government, Minister of State, Deputy White, confirm  that this remains the position?  Will she confirm that there will be an opportunity for questions and answers on the conclusion of statements?  I would like clarification on that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">The purpose of the statement made by the Minister for Finance in respect of the banking crisis was to end the uncertainty relating to the cost of the bank bailout by providing a final estimate of the overall cost involved.  The figure provided is only an estimate and there is a long way to go in respect of this matter.  Many experienced commentators have suggested that the final figure will be considerably higher than that currently being employed by the Minister.  As already stated, there is a long way to go.  In that context, none of the NAMA properties have even been placed on the market and the working-through mechanism relating to them has not yet been employed.  The figure the Minister for Finance provided is only an estimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The fact that we are only now — a full two years after the granting of a blanket guarantee to the banks — being given an estimate demonstrates the absolute and appalling incompetency of the Government in handling this crisis.  It is extraordinary that the situation was allowed to drift for two years, from September 2008 to recent weeks, before an estimate was placed on the cost of the bank bailout.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The final estimates for Anglo Irish, AIB and Irish Nationwide Building Society are significantly different from those previously provided.  The Minister has given little or no explanation as to why this is the case.  For example, the estimate relating to Irish Nationwide Building Society has doubled from the original €2.7 billion to €5.4 billion.  Why were the estimates previously provided so wide of the mark?  Apart from Mr. Colm Doherty and Mr. Dan O'Connor, who else at AIB will be held accountable for what happened within the bank?</p>
          <p eId="para_468">In the statement he made a couple of weeks ago, the Minister made the usual attempt to shut down any questioning of his decisions.  Referring to his decision not to require senior debt holders to share the burden, the Minister stated:  "Any alternative strategy as advocated by some creates a significant risk of jeopardising the banking system's and indeed the State's access to international debt markets and cannot be countenanced on that basis".  The fact is that in the Ireland of 2010 we have moved way beyond that kind of nonsense.  It is no longer the case that the priest, the Minister or the banker knows what is best and must not be questioned.  We hope those days are gone.  It seems incredible that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, would come out with such comments, basically saying he was above reproach while trying to shut down any debate or questioning of the action or lack of action taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">People have both a right and responsibility to ask questions.  When we get the answers, people can decide whether they agree with the proposed course of action, but unless that basic information is provided people will continue to be kept in the dark.  Were it not for the Opposition questioning what the Government was doing on the specific issue of subordinated debt, there would undoubtedly have been no movement on the Government's part to force those debt holders to share the burden to some extent.  It was only in the past month that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, conceded that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The Central Bank's estimates appear very conservative with regard to property prices, although nobody can know these with certainty.  The estimates do not include any burden-sharing with subordinated debt holders, and any subsequent saving should reduce the estimated final cost.  That does not seem to be factored into the estimates we have heard.  The over-riding objective of the Minister in dealing with the issue should be to ensure that he minimises the actual cost to the taxpayer.  There is very little evidence he is pursuing that objective.  The total cost of the banking bailout must be met by the taxpayers and the banks' debt holders.  In simple terms, the more the debt holders contribute to the cost, the less the taxpayer will have to pay, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">It has been the Government's position since the bank guarantee was introduced in September 2008 that any cost of a bank bailout should be borne by the taxpayers alone.  Crucially, this is the mistake made by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his colleagues in the Cabinet.  Only reluctantly have they accepted that holders of subordinated debt should have any share in the burden and even then they have specifically restricted this to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Scare tactics such as the statement by the Minister for Finance, or bold statements such as "senior debt obligations rank equally with depositors under Irish law" do not help the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">So what if that is the case?  We are talking about beggaring the taxpayer and this country for a generation, and the Minister does not appear to see that there is any fairness or equity in the principle that people should share the burden, especially those who gambled and knew they were buying high-risk debt and getting returns on the basis of that risk.  They knew there was always a possibility that they could lose all or part of the investment in the end.  For some unknown reason, the Minister chose to shield those people up until recently.  The argument, which the Minister used spuriously, was utilised to block any discussion on the subject of extending the principle of burden sharing.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">It is important to consider the issue from a different angle.  The Minister's statement has confirmed that Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and AIB are all insolvent and cannot survive without capital injections from the taxpayer.  Why should the taxpayer pay anything to subsidise the banks' debt holders?  Our starting position should be a requirement that any shortfall be made up from all debt holders, including those of AIB, before any money is paid by the taxpayer.  If there are convincing arguments not to do this in particular cases, we should of course consider them, but we have not heard any such arguments.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">In the meantime, it is important to get information on the debt holders, on which there has been a paucity of any information.  The taxpayer will be in hock for the next umpteen years because of this scandal and deserves to have access to that information.  There are a number of questions to be answered in this respect.  Which institutions or individuals currently own the debt?  We are also entitled to know when the debts were issued.  We should know the repayment terms and in particular if the holders of subordinated debt were given a higher rate of return for the perceived higher risk associated with their investment.  Are the holders of senior debt receiving a higher return than depositors?  People will be paying an enormous price for this over the next decade or so and we are entitled to that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">We must also know what discounts are operating in the open market on these debts.  There have been rumours that the European Central Bank may have recently bought some of the banks' debt.  This should not be a secret and it emphasises the need to have access to the kind of information I have just mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Given the current precarious state of the country's finances and what we have seen recently in the sovereign bond market, it would be helpful for the country to be given information explaining exactly what the Government is attempting to do.  The latest financial crisis in our bond markets was completely avoidable and resulted directly from the Government's inaction and dithering on sorting out the Anglo Irish Bank mess.  During 2010, the Government drifted along with a good bank and bad bank proposal that was always highly unlikely to be accepted by the EU.  When the Commission, unsurprisingly, told our Minister for Finance on 7 September that the plan was unacceptable, the credibility of the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, and the Government was undermined.  The action highlighted the fact that despite Anglo Irish Bank having been nationalised for more than 20 months, the Government and this Minister still had no estimate of its final cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Subsequent disappointing economic news merely fuelled the fire of uncertainty that was created.  We are now paying an extra 1% for our borrowing compared with a month ago, with the main needless cause being the unnecessary uncertainty created by the Government which has resulted in external investors having even less confidence in the Government than they had four weeks ago.  If the truth is to be told, external investors probably have little or no confidence in the Government.  Unfortunately, it is the people who continue to pay the price for this Government's incompetence.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">It is important to ask further questions.  Why did it take the Government so long to come to the conclusion that Anglo Irish Bank needed to be wound up?  It is known by major investors throughout the world that Anglo Irish Bank is a rogue business which has had a catastrophic impact on Ireland and almost brought down the entire country.  The State has had to plough in tens of millions of euro to try to repair the damage and in order to meet this cost, the Government has introduced significant salary and social benefit cuts, as well as tax increases.  It is planning even further harsh measures in a climate of spiralling unemployment.  In these circumstances it is reasonable for the State to decide all depositors, including interbank depositors, should be reimbursed while everyone else, including senior and subordinated debt holders, should pay towards the banking collapse.  We still do not know why the Government took so long to consider anyone else, apart from the taxpayer, paying the price for the almighty mess it had created.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">It is also important to examine in some detail the role the Minister for Finance played in this entire debacle.  The manner in which the European Commission rejected the Government's good-bank-bad-bank proposal while the Minister for Finance travelled to Brussels to argue for it demonstrates how detached he and the Government had become from EU decision-makers.  It also highlighted the low esteem in which they are held.  This was a humiliating and potentially dangerous position for our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Crucially, it also blows a hole in the myth that, despite all the disasters, the Minister for Finance still retains the trust and confidence of the international community.  Last month's slap down by the European Commission and record Irish bond yields has demonstrated that the Minister for Finance is not taken seriously at European Commission level.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">He also needs to be challenged on several statements he made during this crisis.  In 2008, he famously stated the blanket guarantee would cost the taxpayer nothing.  Now we know what the final bill is likely to be, what does that say about his judgment?  He claimed subordinated debt amounted to just 3%, a really insignificant figure not worth considering.  That was 3% of €450 billion, however.  If he had tackled that debt at an early stage, we would not be facing a fiscal crisis in the upcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Another erroneous statement made by the Minister was that Merrill Lynch recommended a blanket guarantee of Anglo Irish Bank, including incidentally all its subordinated debt.  There is no supporting documentation for this claim.  The evidence in the papers provided to the Committee of Public Accounts actually points to Merrill Lynch warning against such a blanket guarantee. In recent months, the Minister has claimed erroneously that the economy has turned the corner.  There is as much validity to that statement as there is to his claim the guarantee would not cost the taxpayer anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">There are other issues concerning the Minister's role that need to be clarified.  The rejection of the good-bank-bad-bank proposal by the European Commission means the Government has wasted another year before establishing the cost of the bailout.  Taxpayers, meanwhile, will pay the price for the Minister's dithering through higher interest charges and cuts to public services to which they are entitled.  Meanwhile many of the senior directors and executives of the various banks, deeply implicated in this disaster are still <i>in situ</i>.  That is the measure of the weakness of the approach taken by the Minister for Finance.  With the blanket guarantee in September 2008 meaning the taxpayer had to pick up the tab for the scandalous behaviour of all of the banks, the Minister was in a position to clear out every board and senior management team in them.  That should have been one of his conditions for providing the guarantee.  Instead, he was quite happy, at a cost to the taxpayer, to leave those who had so much to answer for remain in their positions with their big salaries and pension entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The European Commission and international investors no longer have confidence in the Minister or in the Taoiseach.  In turn, that is not only damaging to the country's reputation but costing us dearly with high interest rates required to be paid on sovereign debt.  Apart from the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and every other Minister who allowed the housing bubble develop knowing the damage it was causing, questions must be also asked of senior officials, now retired, who played a major part in this catastrophe such as Mr. Neary, supposedly the Financial Regulator, Mr. Hurley, former Governor of the Central Bank, and Mr. Doyle, from the Department of Finance.  Their roles in bringing this country to its knees must be examined.  Hopefully, next week the Minister for Finance will provide answers.  The Committee of Public Accounts intends to pursue answers from all those responsible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_485">Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thógaint labhairt ar an gceist rí-thábhachtach seo, is é sin an ráiteas a thug an tAire Airgeadais ar 30 Meán Fómhair maidir leis an gcóras baincéireachta agus an gcruachás ina bhfuilimid faoi láthair.  Ba chóir go labharfadh gach Teachta amach ar an gceist seo agus go leagfadh sé nó sí amach an seasamh atá aige nó aici, in ionad seasamh an pháirtí.  Mar sin, is trua nach bhfuil Teachtaí Fhianna Fáil nó Teachtaí na nGlasaigh anseo inniu ag labhairt.  An cuma atá ar an scéal ná nach mbeidh Teachta eile ag labhairt i mo dhiaidh ar na ráitis seo.  Tá sé tábhachtach go dtiocfaidh an tAire Airgeadais os ár gcomhair chomh luath agus is féidir le ceisteanna a fhreagairt ar an ábhar seo, cé go bhfuil go leor ceisteanna eile le freagairt aige maidir leis an gcruachás ina bhfuilimid.  Is trua nár cuireadh an Dáíl agus gnó na Dála ina iomlán ar leataobh chun déileáil leis an ábhar seo i suí Dála amháin, thar cúpla lá má ba ghá.  Mar atá sé, tá an díospóireacht scartha ón 30 Meán Fómhair go dtí inniu, an 14 Deireadh Fómhair, coicís i ndiaidh don Aire an ráiteas a thabhairt.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Ar aon chaoi, an phríomh gnó gur mhaith liomsa labhairt faoi ná fadhbanna atá againn agus conas is féidir teacht tríothu.  Measaim go bhfuil bealach timpeall ar an gcruachás seo, ach is ceist pholaitiúil agus tosaíochta í.  Tá an deis againn anois díriú isteach ar chonas ár sochaí a mhúnlú don todhchaí.  Faoi láthair, níl an tAire nó an Rialtas ag déileáil leis sin.  Níl aon mandate acu chun déileáil leis nó níl mandate acu d'aon rud a ndearna siad le dhá bhliain anuas, mar ní sin an seasamh a chuir siad faoi bhráid an phobail nuair a sheas siad sa toghchán i 2007.  Bhí i bhfad Éireann níos mó eolais acu faoi a bhí romhainn ag an am ná mar a bhí siad ag ligint orthu ná mar atá siad tar éis a admháil go dtí seo.  No matter what way one dresses it up, it is the public who will suffer the consequences of the decisions taken on 30 September 2010 and in the past to give a guarantee to banks that the Government will underwrite everything.  No matter what way one dresses it up, it is those with disabilities, who did not benefit during the Celtic tiger years, and those living in abject and relative poverty who will suffer the most because the Government seems intent on hitting the poorest in our society hardest in order to bail out its friends and colleagues in the banking sectors and the developers who speculated.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I spoke earlier at a Disability Federation of Ireland pre-budget forum at which wheelchair users and other people with disabilities were very fearful of the consequences of the forthcoming budget because they know — they have already felt the consequences — this Government's policy is to make them pay for the its mistakes and that of its banking friends.  At the end of the day, it is all about political and economic priorities because the Government is making decisions because it believes that it is more important to give a crutch to the gamblers rather than to ensure that those in our society are protected.  It is willing to underwrite the gambler and allow him or her to reap the benefits of a gamble and go off to reoffend.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">All of this is tied to a lack of sovereignty.  The decisions that we are now being tied into by the Government will last for many generations to come.  The Government is tightening the noose around the neck of the normal working class person.  It is wresting our sovereignty away from us and handing it over to other institutions.  Part of the agenda that has been pursued for quite a number of years by the Government, in its various formations, has been to privatise public services.  We will see that happen lock, stock and barrel as a consequence of its mistakes in the banking sector and development.  It is happening more quickly than the Progressive Democrats ever predicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">It is also getting it in the neck because of the consequences of other EU treaties such as the Maastricht treaty which the Government supported but some of us opposed.  It said our economic sovereignty would never be wrested from us, that there was no such thing and that we were scaremongering.  It is coming to fruition now.  Every economic decision the Government is making has to be examined by somebody outside Ireland over whom we have absolutely no control.  That is the consequence of the Maastricht treaty and further integration in the European Union.  Far from scaremongering, what we and others said at the time in that and other debates on other treaties has come to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I will now turn to a different aspect and something which we often forget, namely, that in this debate we need to differentiate between senior managers and policy makers and ground level staff in the banking sector.  In the debate on the disastrous banking bailout and the discussions — what little of it has happened on the other side of the House — on the crimes of the bank bosses, very little has been said about the consequences for ground level workers behind the counters in banks up and down the country.  It is vital to differentiate between senior management and those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">People are justifiably angry with the banks but they need to be careful not to take their anger out on people who are workers like themselves.  The anger needs to be focused on fats cats, the likes of Seán FitzPatrick and Michael Fingleton.  People are correct to focus on them and the Government.  A survey conducted by RTE and the Irish Bank Officials Association, IBOA, found that three out of every four bank officials have experienced abuse from the public because they work for a bank.  Some 40% had experienced abuse, both inside and outside their workplace on a regular basis.  Reported experiences include being spat at, being called "the scum of the earth", threatened with violence and being blamed for the tragic suicide of someone who was drowning in debt.  Someone was called a murderer for that reason and that is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The people at whom the anger needs to be focused are those at the top.  It is all a little merry-go-round at the top because all one has to do is look at those who made the mistakes.  Virtually every one of them has found another job in another bank at the very same level.  These are the economic illiterate diverse society.  One should have a look at the top layer of the banking sector and those who gave advice to the Minister for Finance on that fateful night because the vast majority of them are still in the same position and still giving bad advice to the Minister and Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The current CEO of Anglo Irish Bank was the head of National Australia Bank when it owned National Irish Bank.  The current managing director of Allied Irish Banks was the head of its capital division.  The CEO of Irish Nationwide Building Society was the head of the Bank of Ireland sidekick in the Six Counties, Bank of Ireland, Northern Ireland.  The current Bank of Ireland CEO was a senior manager in the bank and was the right hand man to the then CEO, Brian Goggin, in the run-up to this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">One can contrast the cosy rotation of the people at the top level of banking with the fate of the employees at the lower end of the ladder who had no say or role whatsoever in the corrupt practices which were pursued by senior management.  They, like the general public, have suffered the consequences of this disaster which was not of their making.  Like the rest of the public and many in this House, they are in the dark over the skulduggery at the top.  The full extent of the skulduggery needs to be exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Job losses in the banking sector from the beginning of the crisis until August 2010 total more than 6,000.  In Bank of Ireland, 1,900 jobs were lost.  Allied Irish Banks, which does not use that name any more because it is not conducive to good business and is now referred to as AIB, has cut 1,700 jobs.  In First Active and Ulster Bank 1,000 jobs have been lost and it is predicted that a further 4,000 jobs will be lost over the next 12 months.  Many of those people are in salaries in the region of €19,000 to €21,000.  They are not the fat cats but are suffering the consequences of the actions of fat cats.  Such bank workers will not get golden handshakes worth millions of euro, which are enjoyed by senior management who are to blame for much of this mess when they are laid off.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">It was well put by the general secretary of the IBOA, Larry Broderick, when he said that the front line staff in the industry "are becoming the collateral damage of the reckless and disastrous policies pursued by senior management".  The banks are in State hands now and the Minister and senior Cabinet colleagues are now the senior management and are responsible future job losses, something which people need to remember.  Are the workers now State employees?  Do they have any of the guarantees State employees have?</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I want to make sure that the Government understands the consequences of its future actions.  AIB, which is in State hands, proposes a fire sale of the First Trust bank which is part of its subsidiary in the Six Counties.  It is a short-term partitionist policy which will cost jobs not only in the Six Counties, but also in this State.  Is that what the Minister wants to stand over?</p>
          <p eId="para_498">In June, we asked the Minister for Finance whether he agreed that the decision by AIB to conduct a fire sale of its Northern Ireland division, First Trust, was a bad partitionist policy and whether, considering that the people now own AIB, the Government should do something about it.  The Minister's answer was entirely unsatisfactory as essentially he said to go ahead and sell it off with absolutely no regard for the arising job losses.  In addition to being short term in thinking, this decision is not in the long-term best interests of AIB, which the State now owns, as it risks becoming dwarfed by its all-Ireland rivals, namely, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">There are also serious implications of the fire sale for jobs here in Dublin.  AIB's administrative support for centralised group functions, including functions for the First Trust division, is carried out in Dublin.  The sale of First Trust will mean many of these functions, and therefore the reason for these jobs, will literally disappear overnight.  The Minister would preside over several hundred job losses in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">We need long-term reform of the banking sector.  The Government is stubbornly and stupidly obsessed with bailing out the banks.  As a result, the real domestic economy which needs vital stimulus has been ignored.  Job creation, public services and stimulus have all been ignored or undermined.  Worse, the Government policy of cuts sucks money out of the real economy and transfers it into the mysterious black hole that is the financial economy.  According to the NCB Purchasing Managers' Index, Ireland's manufacturing sector shrank again in September.  Statistics from the CSO show that in the year to the end of July, retail sales, excluding cars, fell by almost 5% on the previous year and the construction sector, which as we know is in dire straits, represented 30% of all insolvencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">At some point, banking transformed from being a service, which did not produce or manufacture anything and whose function was to facilitate the economy and the day-to-day workings of business and society, into a dizzying economy in and of itself.  A big lesson for the economic illiterate in the Government is that banking should be a provider of credit to facilitate growth; it should not be the growth.  The problem with the Celtic tiger was that the banking sector became the growth.  All of the Monopoly or illusionary money which did not exist became the focus of the Government.  It never produced anything, and did not exist bar on a computer.  It is an abstract concept.  The question should not be, "show me the money", it should be, "show me the product".  If one has a product one should be able to sell it, but it did not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The financial markets are not grounded in any sensible reality.  A recent report by Mitsubishi security analysts suggests that real economic assets are worth $49 trillion globally while financial assets, the illusionary money, are valued at $159 trillion.  There is a huge difference.  The illusionary money is what has caused the problem here, and is what will cause problems in the future unless we take the opportunity to refocus our economy and where society is going, and deal with real people with real products in a real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Sinn Féin has alternative proposals, which we have promoted, but to date the Government has not listened.  We have produced credible proposals on job creation, alternatives for funding our social welfare system and alternatives for how we invest in public services and works.  One of these is not to bail out the bondholders.  We should burn the Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.  They bought bank debt not sovereign debt.  They gambled, and sometimes when one gambles one suffers the consequences; in this case they should do so because they lost.  We did not lose but the Government is making us lose because of the consequences of a gamble by others.  If we burn the Anglo Irish Bank bondholders, it would immediately free up the €17 billion which the Government has committed for other public service and job creation projects.  These bondholders did not lend money to the State.  They did not lend money to me or anybody else in the State.  It was private money lent to private banks.  They were not loans to create jobs or build schools; they were loans to speculate and accumulate.  To speculate means one can lose.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The good deposits in Anglo Irish Bank should be moved to AIB as a State bank which is now nationalised.  This would help with its recapitalisation.  AIB must then become a proper State bank rather than a bank which we have bailed out.  It must return to focus on the more traditional banking functions of minding people's money and providing credit flows to the real economy.  The bank guarantee which the Minister extended on 30 September must be abolished.  Why should the taxpayer suffer the consequences of the reckless gambling, speculation and trading of others?  Why should they suffer the consequences of poor management and grievances?  The cost to the taxpayer of bailing out the banks is at least €50 billion.  The Government is spending €29 billion on Anglo Irish Bank and €5.4 billion on Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The Government is borrowing this money and the interest charged is likely to accumulate to €17 billion over ten years, bringing the total cost to the Government to €51.4 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">What else could we do with this money?  We could stimulate job creation and the economy.  We could create new public works which are vitally needed, such as schools.  It could be invested in education and research or innovation and entrepreneurship.  People could use that money to pay off their mortgages.  One could pay off the interest on everyone's mortgage for eight years and people could use their own money to stimulate the economy.  One could pay everybody's grocery bills for five years, scrap fares on public transport for 66 years, give every old age pensioner a €55,000 grant for two years or build 150 new 50-teacher schools and run them for 75 years.  I could come up with many more solutions as to how we could spend that money and it would be more beneficial to us in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Government's policies and solutions are disastrous.  It does not have a mandate for them and at this stage it needs to get out of office and put its proposals to the people, just as we will.  Then we will see what the people return.  That is the solution to some of it.  Another part of the solution is to refocus and redirect our economy so it looks after the needs of the public and not after the needs of private vested interests.</p>

        <speech by="#AineBrady" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
          <p eId="para_507">The banking measures announced last week were a necessary and timely intervention by Government to ensure the overall restructuring of our banking system succeeds and that our banks can meet the real needs of our economy as we move forward.  The Minister has previously stated on several occasions that our banks lent recklessly and that is now painfully obvious to all of us.  Continuing uncertainty as to the ultimate cost of this reckless lending was proving to be very damaging to confidence in our banks and indeed to confidence in the capacity of the sovereign to meet our funding needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">We are at last able to put figures on the final cost.  For this, the Minister extends his appreciation to the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, the Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield, the NTMA and the Department of Finance and to the NAMA management team for the work they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">There is no denying the size of the problem.  The considerable losses in our banks have been built up over the course of several years when financial institutions set aside the fundamentals of prudent banking and became dangerously over-exposed to land development and related lending.  It is only normal that people would feel frustration or anger at what has happened and would seek to find easy solutions, but these do not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">This debate is an opportunity for the House to consider our future banking sector and the Minister welcomes the many constructive contributions made.  Although the situation is very serious, it can and will be managed.  Difficult though it is has been, we have had to take steps to ensure that we continue to have a functioning banking system with banks soundly capitalised and providing normal banking services such as safeguarding deposits and prudently lending money to real people in the real economy.  Our road to recovery as a nation depends on our capacity to grow, to export and to create jobs.  Whatever the past sins of our banks, and they are many, it is an inescapable fact that they have a fundamental role to play as we move into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Shareholders in the banks have already suffered very significant losses and now the subordinated bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and INBS will be expected to share the burden too.  Deputy Noonan raised the issue of burden-sharing by all bondholders.  Both the State and the banks rely on bondholders, the same bondholders who continue to invest in our banks and in the State.  We live in a small and very open economy.  We cannot attempt to simply turn our back on the world.  Default is not an option the Minister will countenance and anyone who advocates default needs to realise that this is not a game.  We cannot gamble the future of our country and risk the consequences of debt default.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">A number of Deputies have asked why a statement leading to certainty could not have been issued sooner.  The fact is that NAMA was established little more than ten months ago and in the short time the agency has been operating it has built up staffing levels, established procedures and issued codes of conduct, and has already purchased loans of over €27 billion.  The NAMA process which includes loan-by-loan valuations could not have progressed any faster.  This process ensures that all of the institutions recognise the full extent of their losses as each loan is assessed, valued and transferred, and the process has been approved by the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">It was only by building on its experience in the transfer of loans in tranches one and two, and through the assessment by NAMA of the remaining loans to transfer, that NAMA has been able to refine its estimates of the discounts on the remaining loans to a high level of accuracy.  NAMA will now utilise this information to ensure that all remaining assets will transfer to the agency as swiftly as possible and in one final tranche for each institution.  It is a measure of the success of NAMA that it has been able to bring this level of accuracy to the calculations of discounts so quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The further State investment for AIB which the Minister announced is absolutely necessary to sustain its capital, which is crucial given the central role that AIB plays in the Irish economy and in the Irish financial system.  With the benefit of this support and following the sale of its overseas operations, AIB will now have a renewed focus on the Irish market.  AIB in the years ahead will have a major role to play in providing normal banking services and prudent lending to real people in a real economy, and in so doing will support our economic recovery.  It is also a positive indicator that Bank of Ireland will not require any further capital from the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">There is no denying the size of the problem. The money committed to the recapitalisation of our two main banks is structured as an investment by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and the State will receive a commercial return on the money invested.  The objective of the State is to maintain AIB as a fully listed entity post-completion of the capital raising necessary to meet its revised PCAR.  This will maximise the chance of attracting private capital for the capital increase and also facilitate future disposals of shares by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">It is important that we differentiate the investments made in credit institutions with a viable future from the money going into banks which clearly do not have a future as independent entities.  The cost of capital resulting from losses in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society combined will be €34.7 billion.  This is a lot of money but it is also a long way short of the €50 billion widely reported as the total cost of rescuing the banking system from collapse.  This money was not lost on the day of the Minister's announcement two weeks ago.  Rather it was lost over the course of several years when all of our financial institutions set aside the fundamentals of prudent banking and became dangerously over-exposed to land and development and related lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">It was alleged by some Deputies that the deferral of bond auctions suggests that bond markets were somehow now closed to us.  This is not the case.  The NTMA advised the Minister that it decided not to proceed with the bond auctions scheduled for October and November because the Exchequer is fully funded until late June 2011.  The NTMA will return to the bond markets in the normal way in early 2011.  In the meantime investors will have had the benefit of the affirmation in the budget that Ireland continues on its planned path of multi-annual fiscal consolidation up until 2014.  The Minister believes that, in time, Thursday, 30 September 2010 will be remembered as a turning point; as the day we finished quantifying the full extent of the work we must do.  The finality we have achieved on measuring the cost of our banking crisis enables us to draw a line under that and to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Our efforts must now be dedicated to restoring sustainability to our public finances and to achieving a general Government deficit of below 3% by 2014.  The Government remains fully committed to meeting this target.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">As the Minister outlined two weeks ago, work is under way on a four-year budgetary plan that will set out the annual measures required to ensure that target is met.  The four-year budgetary plan will be published in early November.  Many contributors to this debate, including Deputies Kenny and Burton, questioned the Government's proposal to introduce a four-year plan.  Ireland, like all other member states, has for some time been asked to give more of the details underpinning our multi-annual consolidation plans.  The plan will show a credible path to achieving our targets of having a deficit below 3% of GDP by the end of 2014 as well as setting out the Department's assessment of the short and medium-term macroeconomic outlook.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The budgetary plan will also highlight structural reform measures and in so doing, demonstrate reforms that will underpin future economic growth.  It is only through adopting policies that enhance our economic growth prospects and improve our competitiveness that we will achieve the necessary targets.  In order to ensure that the targets as set are delivered, reforms to the budgetary framework will also be a part of the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The announcement of the four-year plan and the renewed commitment to tackling our public finance deficit has been generally well received by the international financial markets.  The plan will be a pathway towards renewed fiscal sustainability.  Budget 2011, which the Minister will present to the Dáil on 7 December, will be a first, but important, step on the road to achieving this goal, now that we are coming out of recession and addressing our banking issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The price of underpinning our banking system is far higher than any of us would have wanted.  The cost is high but it is manageable.  We must not forget what we as a people are capable of achieving.  We should be positive in our ability to meet the challenges ahead.  As former United States President Bill Clinton, speaking on his visit here just after the announcement, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_523">All the talents, all the abilities, all the incentives, they are still there.  I have utterly no doubt that the country will come back and that you will come back with a more diversified economy, less vulnerable than what just happened to you.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Government believes we will emerge from this experience the better for it.  We will be strengthened through the lessons we have learnt on regulatory structures and banking supervision and through efficiencies in the way in which we run the State as we redress the balance between what we take in and what we spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Minister appreciates the positive contributions made in the course of this debate on the banking system and wishes to thank all the Deputies who spoke on the matter.  The banking measures announced two weeks ago represent the final staging post in the journey to bring certainty and clarity to the projected costs for the State for the resolution of our most distressed institutions.  It is a key milestone in ensuring that a broader scale restructuring of the banking sector overall is successfully achieved in order that we have for the future a banking system that is firmly focused on meeting the needs of the real economy — sustainable employment creation and the savings, investment and credit needs of regular individuals, households and businesses in our society.  It is an issue of the greatest significance to our country, and the willingness of this House to engage constructively in helping to achieve resolution is very welcome.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_528">I welcome the opportunity to continue my contribution on this Bill.  When I last spoke on it I raised the question of schools being in the control of the Government.  One such school is the model school in Monaghan.  I made the point that although it is under the patronage of the Minister for Education and Science, it has been left untouched for many years, although promises were made to restructure and extend it.  I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Science for having given a promising commitment in respect of the work required in recent months and hopefully it will be seen to.  I make that point in passing because we are talking about primary schools being taken into the VEC structure.  The solution to issues is not always the simplest answer that can be given.  It is important to have independent committees in charge and for them to make sure that schools are maintained and run properly.  The model school in Monaghan is one of only a few in the country.  It is hard to justify to its current chairman, the Reverend Ian Berry, and committee why the school has been left so long without the required work being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">To return to the VEC model, the Minster made the point in her contribution that the VECs are local.  That is the specific point she made.  She said: "I believe that it is both appropriate and important that the State, through local VECs, should be in a position to participate in primary education provision in order to provide an alternative patronage model at this level".  That is at a time when the Minister is proposing that the local element of the VECs would be removed, that no longer would the model operate on a county structure and that the number of VECs would be reduced from 33 to 16.  The stated reason for doing this is to minimise costs.  When that decision is examined in the context of the Croke Park agreement, it is important to bear in mind that if one tries to cut the salaries of CEOs in light of the fact that the number of VECs will be reduced from 33 to 16, one will find that redundancies cannot be given under that agreement.  There is a mix up here which needs to be quickly clarified, otherwise many VECs will find themselves in cloud cuckoo land.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">We were given a commitment some years ago that by withdrawing the local structures in the health service we would have a fantastic structure called the HSE and that it would result in fairer play for everybody and that everything would be grand.  We know especially in terms of services in Cavan-Monaghan, as does the Ceann Comhairle in terms of services in counties Louth and Meath, that what we were told has not been the result.  The new structure has had a desperate impact.  My colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party are claiming responsibility for working to get services re-opened in Monaghan General Hospital whereas they refused to back those of us who were fighting for this only nine or ten months ago.  We need to be careful that the changes being made to the restructuring of VECs are for the right reasons and that they are being done to save costs.  If we remove the local political responsibility from these bodies, we will weaken the involvement of elected members.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">As I said during the debate yesterday, we have a fantastic chief executive officer in County Monaghan VEC, Mr. Martin O'Brien, who has revolutionised this area.  He is a far-seeing, ambitious, hard-working individual who is changing the attitude towards the VEC in Monaghan, but it is sad that at this time the VEC in Monaghan will be linked with the VEC in Cavan.  Unfortunately, our experience in Monaghan, despite the fact that Monaghan has four TDs with only one in Cavan, is that everything seems to be located in Cavan.  The hospital services are now in Cavan and the Teagasc offices have moved to Cavan, while the Teagasc offices in Monaghan are up for sale.  Services in Monaghan are not getting any better.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I met a senior officer in Teagasc recently who told me there is no real problem and that the officers in Teagasc can do all the work through e-mail and text.  Successful business people do not rely on e-mail or text.  They board planes and travel to meet the people in industry.  If we are to run proper businesses we must do the same, be it at Teagasc or VEC level or anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Another issue I am concerned about, which is linked to the health services, is the idea that responsibility for some of the services now provided by the Department of Education and Skills would move to the Department of Health and Children.  I worked for years to get a special language class open in Monaghan.  That service, and services for the disadvantaged in general, are extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the position before it is too late.  If we move these systems into an uncontrolled, out of touch Health Service Executive-type body that is only interested in keeping the high level structures in place and not the front-line services, we will have a serious problem.  I beg the Minister, as I know other colleagues have done, to re-examine that entire system and ensure the schools have control of services for the disadvantaged and the other areas mentioned in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The only people who can really understand the problems of a child are the parents and the teacher.  They will be the first to see when a problem arises and they should have some say in this respect and have quick access to experts and not have to wait on structures that simply do not deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I want to mention another issue which may not be relevant to the Bill but is extremely important.  In some cases where a vacancy arises in a school, retired teachers are being taken back.  That is at a time when there are 450,000 people unemployed.  Many young teachers cannot get jobs because the first question they are asked is if they have experience.  The way they could get experience is for them to fill the vacancies that arise when somebody is on maternity leave, sick leave or for some other reason.  I urge the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, where she is paying the bill on our behalf, to insist that young trained teachers are given priority over retired teachers.  I do not have anything against retired teachers but we are in an economic disaster and we must make sure that young people are given hope.  Hope is something we do not have in this country at present and it is vital we return to a position where we do have hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I want to touch on some other areas that are vital, including back to work schemes and so on.  I am holding a copy of an e-mail from a young lady in my constituency not far from home who has completed a FETAC level 5 qualification in business and banking but cannot get a job.  She applied for a child care job in the local centre in her home village where she lives, which would be very convenient.  She was accepted by the centre, which was delighted that someone with such excellent qualifications would join its staff.  However, following contact with FÁS, the young lady was told in no uncertain terms that the job was not available because her qualifications were so high.  We must get our act together and remove red tape and technical obstacles which prevent people such as this young woman, who has a child and excellent qualifications, from securing employment.  The difference between the lone parent payment she receives and her income from the job in question would be minimal.  It would benefit the State if she were to take up employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">This case is only one of many examples.  In another case, a young man who applied for a course commencing in September was informed that he was not eligible for the back-to-education allowance because he had been in receipt of social welfare payments for seven and a half months rather than the nine month period required.  If we are serious about keeping young people in this country and getting them off social welfare, we must use common sense.  These cases are unacceptable to me and many others.  While the problems to which I refer may not be relevant to the provisions of the Bill, they are relevant to those affected, which is the reason I raise them.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The decision to allow vocational education committees to assume patronage of primary schools does not have major relevance or cause problems for my constituents in Cavan-Monaghan.  Over the years, denominational schools from both sides of the religious divide have given great service in the constituency.  I understand the Catholic Church, in particular, wishes to end its involvement in certain schools in some areas.  I accept the church's position in this regard and do not have a problem supporting the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">We must recognise the extremely valuable work done by church bodies, notwithstanding the criticism levelled at them.  In many cases, Catholic religious orders gave their services for free.  Without their involvement in education, many people would have been much worse off.  Times have changed, however, and many of those living in new areas of housing want to have their children educated in non-denominational schools.  The vocational education committees have a major role to play in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In my constituency, the community school in Clones is operated jointly by the Catholic Church and County Monaghan VEC and the arrangement is working extremely well.  The constituency also has the Bailieborough community school, a comprehensive school in Cootehill, four excellent VEC schools in County Cavan and five such schools in County Monaghan.  The Monaghan Institute of Further Education and Training also provides a tremendous service to young people in Monaghan, as does the college in Cavan.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">This year, thousands of those who applied to enrol in these colleges were unable to secure a place because the post-leaving certificate courses were unable to cope with demand.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue.  Many thousands of primary and secondary level teachers are unable to find employment.  We must find a way to enrol additional students in third level colleges to enable them to continue their education rather than having them on social welfare, which is a dead end.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I ask the Minister to reconsider the position.  From speaking to Mr. Martin O'Brien, the CEO of County Monaghan VEC, and staff in Cavan I know the colleges have sufficient space available to accommodate additional students if they received approval to employ the personnel required to teach them.  If we are serious about educating young people to third level, such approval would make a good start at the lowest possible cost.  In addition, young people would be able to continue to live at home while benefiting from further education.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterKellyFF" eId="spk_278">
          <from>Deputy Peter Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_544">The Education (Amendment) Bill will pave the way for the involvement of vocational education committees in primary education, create a welcome community national school model and make a number of other notable changes to the Education and Teaching Council Acts.  The Bill provides for a legislative framework to allow VECs to become involved in the provision of primary education.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">As the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills stated when she published the Bill, the changing shape of our society in recent years has placed new demands on our education system to become more diverse.  Government policy in recent years has been to provide for a plurality of patronage in our education system.  Our system of patronage to date has shown it has the capacity to change.  It has already supported the establishment of schools by An Foras Pátrúnachta and Educate Together.  Since 1997, 170 new schools have opened.  While 29 of them were catholic schools, the majority were opened onto an alternative system of patronage under Educate Together and An Foras Pátrúnachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The Educate Together movement has established many schools and now has 56 schools, of which two opened in September.  Furthermore, two schools under a pilot community national school model opened in Dublin in 2008 and a further three opened in September this year in counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  As well as diversity by type of religion or ethos, the number of gaelscoileanna is also increasing, with 138 such schools in place.  While the Catholic Church still controls 90% of schools in the primary school sector, progress clearly has been made in providing greater choice for parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I welcome the VEC community national school model.  The VECs have already proved themselves to be extremely successful at secondary level and there is no reason the State should not become involved at primary level and achieve the same success.  This new model will welcome and respect children of all faiths and can only benefit local communities.  However, it must not replace existing models of patronage but instead complement other patrons.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The Bill also provides that boards of management of schools under the new patronage model will operate in the same way as boards of management in primary schools generally, rather than on the governance model used in post-primary VEC schools.  The board of management of a school established under this legislation will not be a sub-committee of a VEC, as is the case for post-primary VEC schools.  This means that teaching and non-teaching staff will be employed by the board of management in the same way as in other primary schools and the board will receive capitation and other funding directly from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">One of the most controversial elements in the Bill and one on which I have received a number of queries is the section that proposes to amend section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001.  The Bill provides for the employment in certain exceptional and limited circumstances of persons who are not registered teachers, following consultations with management, unions and the Teaching Council.  According to the Tánaiste, it is not always possible for schools to engage a registered, qualified teacher due to many factors.  As she explained in her speech to the Dáil yesterday, this amendment will allow the Minister to regulate in a measured way the use of unregistered teachers in exceptional and limited circumstances where their use may be necessary.  To date, the use of unqualified personnel has been unregulated and this amendment to the Teaching Council Act seeks to amend the position.     While I welcome the Tánaiste's explanation in this regard, I believe this issue must be debated further as it has caused much confusion for qualified and registered teachers who are unemployed at present.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport" eId="spk_281">
            <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport  (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_553">I welcome Deputy Deenihan to this portfolio.  He will bring added interest and vigour to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">My policy on the arts, culture and film sectors reflects Government policy in this area as set out in the programme for Government.  This policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase the profile of, access to, and participation in, culture and the arts, make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, maximise the potential for cultural tourism and grow the film and audiovisual production sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">The Government is keenly aware of the economic potential of the arts and creative industries and their role in supporting enterprise and innovation in the economy as a whole, as highlighted at the global Irish economic forum in Farmleigh.  It also is determined to use Ireland's unique cultural assets as a way of distinguishing it from other tourism destinations and thereby attracting an increasing number of cultural tourists in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">At the same time, while our arts, culture and heritage are important contributors to sustainable economic recovery, I appreciate that their contribution should never be measured in financial terms alone.  Rather, they should be appreciated also for the social, cultural and educative benefits that they bring to communities large and small throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">Government policy on the arts has been and will continue to be enabled and implemented through the agencies and institutions within my Department, namely, the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board and Culture Ireland, as well as the cultural institutions within my Department's remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">Recently, as part of the preparation of my Department's statement of strategy for the period 2010-14, I have consulted the agencies under my Department's aegis, as well a number of interested parties in the arts and culture areas.  I will consider the suggestions put forward in this consultation when finalising this strategy, which will include a clear description of my Department's strategic priorities for the period 2011-13, reinforced by key objectives and timelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">The arts, cultural and creative sector is constantly in a state of renewal and evolution.  The challenge in the current economic environment is to work smarter within the limited public financial resources available to build on our strengths and to seize new opportunities.   For example, one of the opportunities discussed at the cultural forum on the new statement of strategy was that presented by developments in the area of information and communications technology.  Members will be aware that digitisation of the 1901 and 1911 census records has opened access to our heritage to an exponentially bigger audience than the paper records ever could have reached.  At the same time, it has created a heightened interest in Ireland around the world that no doubt will help to attract here increasing numbers of so-called roots tourists in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">Similarly, the Irish Film Board highlighted the opportunities for the Irish film industry of the increasing migration to Internet-based viewing and marketing of audiovisual content.  Small Irish productions will never be able to compete with the huge marketing spend of Hollywood studios but can get into people's homes through platforms such as iTunes and can win audiences through word of mouth on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">My overall goal, as reflected in the forthcoming statement of strategy for the Department, will be to help the sector as a whole to seize on such opportunities and to come through the current challenges in position to achieve greater success in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_562">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply and assure her that I will give her all possible co-operation in my new role.  I am sure we can work together in the interests of the arts, tourism and sport.  As part of her strategy, I encourage the Minister to protect the progress that has been made over the past 20 years.  In addition, the Minister's new strategy should encourage new writing, new writers and new artists and it will be important to bring the arts out to venues throughout the country.  These policies should be the pillars of the new strategy.  However, will this be possible when one considers that just two years ago, arts funding was €83 million whereas in last year's budget, it was pared down to €67 million.  Both the Arts Council and arts organisations nationwide have pared back their expenditure as much as they can and a further reduction this year would mean the loss of important personnel and the necessity to discontinue programmes they have built up over the years.  Consequently, in view of the new departmental strategy, can the Minister assure Members that funding will not be cut in this year's budget?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_283" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_563">The Deputy is aware that it is not possible at this stage to give any commitments regarding the budget.  However, the Government's commitment to the arts has been proven over the years.  The Arts Council is just one method by which the Government funds the arts.  This also takes place through capital funding through all the access projects nationwide, which builds on the point of ensuring the arts are available to all sectors and in all  geographic parts of the country.  Moreover, substantial capital funding is available for the next few years to build on that.  The funding to which the Deputy referred also does not include funding for the national cultural institutions and nor does it include funding for the Irish Film Board.  Significant investment is being made in the arts and naturally, the Government will aim to ensure that it protects as much of it as possible.  However, given the financial circumstances, it is not possible to provide a blanket guarantee to any one sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">I should point out that the Arts Council funding of €68.7 million is still €21 million more than was the case in 2002 and that a significant leap took place during those years.  However, of added value in making an argument to the Department of Finance at budget time is that the arts now are no longer perceived as being an extra in society but as being highly integrated and as contributing to the country's economic value.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_565">I encourage the Minister to include in the departmental strategy one or two iconic or landmark projects.  Given that Dublin now has been designated as a UNESCO city of literature, I strongly encourage her to seriously consider establishing a writers' museum or centre in Dublin that would both celebrate the achievements of Ireland's past writers, including its Nobel laureates, and simultaneously would encourage contemporary writers.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_566">I hope that throughout the country and through the education system, young people can be encouraged to write and to be creative, particularly given our history of storytelling.  This history is no longer simply being linked to the cultural tradition.  For example, if one takes the old Irish tradition of storytelling and links it to modern technology, one suddenly has an Oscar-winning animation industry.  Such links also can be made and even on Culture Night, the Dublin Writers' Centre was open to allow people to participate in a never-ending story to which I added my own small paragraph.  Various groups are engaged in activities nationwide, including a writers' museum and a writers' centre.  However, I accept the point the Deputy is making is to try to encourage the literary aspect and having the UNESCO city of literature designation, to which Members will return later, is one way to build on that.</p>

I believe that while the Irish Sports Council sets out its case, Ms Coghlan’s arguments are set out in the court transcripts.  Both sides have now had their say.  A settlement was agreed in court and commissioning a further report would only serve to incur more financial expense and prolong the acrimony.  I believe it is important at this stage to draw a line under what happened and to focus on the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">I expect the statutory agencies reporting to me to adhere to best corporate governance practices and, in general, the Irish Sports Council has done so.  It is important to learn from this case how one can avoid similar cases arising in the future and ensure that public moneys are not used to meet the costs of legal settlements at the expense of the development of sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">Last month, I announced the appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey as the new chairman of the Irish Sports Council for a five-year term.  As Members will be aware, Mr. Mulvey has been chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission since 1991.  He has served on a number of public bodies, including the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the National Economic and Social Council and the Governing Bodies of UCD and DCU.  He is a former general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland  and the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  Mr. Mulvey has also acted as a consultant with the European Union and the International Labour Organisation on matters relating to public management, human resources and industrial relations.  He recently chaired the negotiations which led to the public service Croke Park agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">He also has had a lifelong interest in Irish sport and has on occasion made himself available to assist various sporting bodies resolve issues of contention.  I am sure his wide range of skills and experience will be of great value to the Irish Sports Council as it works with the national governing bodies of sport to increase participation in sport, improve standards of performance and ensure that best practice is followed in management, governance and operating procedures at all levels of Irish sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">I have asked Mr. Mulvey to consider the corporate governance practices followed by the council and to provide assurances to me that best practice is exercised by the Irish Sports Council in its dealings with its customers.  I have also asked him to ensure that the council promotes the use of mediation and arbitration where difficulties do arise.  I have no doubt that Mr. Mulvey's own considerable experience in this area will be invaluable in that respect.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_287">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_575">I welcome the appointment of Mr. Mulvey to the important post of chairman of the Irish Sports Council.  The role will undoubtedly be challenging but his experience will be of great importance to the council and in terms of the spin-off for other sporting bodies throughout the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">I tabled this question reluctantly.  Like the Minister, I do not wish to see more public money spent — I will not say "wasted" — on the particular case to which she referred in her response.  However, it is somewhat unfair that the Irish Sports Council's interpretation and view of the events in question are available on the Department's website but not the view of Ms Mary Coghlan.  That is biased and unfair.  A comparison of the report from the Irish Sports Council with Mary Coghlan's report, which was published elsewhere, shows a series of contradictions between the two.  For example, there is disagreement in regard to the use of a mediation process.  Such a process either took place or it did not.  The Irish Sports Council says the former chief executive officer demanded compensation, but the latter says this is completely false and without foundation.  There are various other serious contradictions between what is on the Department's website and what has been made freely available to the public by Ms Coghlan.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">In the interests of justice and fair play there should be an independent review of this matter.  I say this reluctantly because I am aware it will cost more money.  However, in fairness both to the chief executive officer and to the Irish Sports Council, the two sides should be looked at separately, independently and without bias.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_578">The reason I published only the report of the Irish Sports Council on the website was that the council did not make any contribution to the High Court because the case was settled.  Therefore, only one side of the case was presented in court, namely, that of Ms Coghlan.  However, by publishing the transcripts on the website, her side of the story has been given a full airing.  All of that is available on the website as well as the comment of the Irish Sports Council.  Out of courtesy I wrote to Ms Coghlan to indicate that the report would be published on the website and I received a reply from her.  However, the Attorney General's advice was that we could not publish her report.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">I see no value for anybody in reopening this issue.  The Irish Sports Council has moved on.  I have impressed upon it the importance of dealing with mediation and arbitration in order to avoid legal cases which use up taxpayers' money that could be going to sport.  Ms Coghlan says it has also been a painful experience for her.  I am anxious to ensure lessons will be learned from it.  So far as we can leave that case behind, the best way of protecting other people, other sports organisations and the Irish Sports Council itself is to have proper procedures in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_580">I join Deputy Upton in welcoming the appointment of Mr. Mulvey as chairman of the Irish Sports Council.  There has never been a greater need in the governance of sport for the industrial relations experience he possesses.  I support Deputy Upton's call for an independent inquiry in this case.  The key question for the public is why we have not heard Ms Coghlan's version of events.  The Minister indicated that she has asked Mr. Mulvey for assurances that best practice will be exercised in the council's dealings with customers.  Is that an implication that this has not been the case in the past, as is the general view?</p>
            <p eId="para_581">There is a need for better governance.  After each Olympic Games, for instance, we have reports from the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Irish Sports Council which are totally divergent.  What is the relationship between the high-performance unit in the council and the Irish Institute of Sport?  It seems many former staff of the institute are coming into the council as consultants.  There are questions to be answered in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">I have a question.  I know of a top athlete who walked away from a training camp a week ago because of disillusionment with the lack of back-up and forward planning.  I am also aware of a very successful boxing coach who has walked away in recent weeks without there being a word of it in the media.</p>

            <p eId="para_585">I cannot comment on individual cases.  There has been great success at the high-performance level during the summer, not least in the sport of boxing.  Responsibility falls on the Irish Sports Council to ensure, through the carding system, that we support top athletes and that there is sufficient funding for the relevant organisations.  That is the council's major role and will be in the coming years as we prepare for the Olympic Games.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">In regard to whose views were heard and whose were not in the legal case we are discussing, I reiterate that one side of the story was given comprehensively in court and the transcripts of that are included on the Department's website.  The Irish Sports Council did not take the opportunity in the High Court to give its side, so its report is also included on the website.  A settlement was reached in this matter.  We all accept that Mr. Mulvey is the right man with the right skills for the role of chairman.  As I said, I have impressed upon him the importance of dealing with governance issues.  That is not to say there were failures in the past, but there were three or four cases which should not have arisen and which cost the State money.  Even prior to appointing the new chairman I indicated to the council the importance of the "just sport" idea, which has been discussed in this House, whereby mediation and arbitration should always be used in the first instance.  As far as possible, the courts should never be used when it comes to sport.</p>

            <p eId="para_587">There are some serious concerns remaining.  Does the Minister not accept that an individual's reputation is at stake here?  I do not propose to be the judge of the case.  However, there is something missing when a report from one side of the argument is published on the Department's website.  Why did the Irish Sports Council choose not to put up a defence in court?  Is the Minister not concerned about that?  Is she satisfied, having read Mary Coghlan's response and the transcript of proceedings, that they coincide or has she any concerns about what is in Ms Coghlan's report relative to the transcript?  These issues can only be dealt with by means of an independent review.</p>

        <b>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport</b>
           if her Department carried out a review of the impact of the air travel tax in the context of the development of the recently published Government strategy on Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_599">The Government's framework for economic renewal included a commitment to develop an action plan to drive export-led growth over the coming years.  Accordingly, the Government's new strategy and action plan for Irish trade, tourism and investment to 2015, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, was drawn up by representatives from the relevant key Departments and agencies, including my Department, Tourism Ireland and Culture Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">This strategy contains targets for job creation, exports, tourist numbers and inward investment projects by 2015 and details on how the Government and its agencies will achieve these priorities and targets.  The tourism related elements of the new strategy draw on the robust analysis already carried out by the tourism renewal group, in preparing its report and framework for action, which was a parallel component of the overall framework for economic renewal.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">The new strategy does not specifically address the air travel tax.  However, it does recognise the absolute importance of access transport for tourism, as well as for trade and investment.  The tourism renewal group reviewed the impact of the air travel tax, drawing on analyses by the tourism agencies, the tourism industry and the airlines, and recommended that the air travel tax be abolished.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">I have discussed the tax in bilateral meetings with the airlines and listened to their concerns about it.  The issue has also arisen in meetings with other bodies involved in the tourism industry and was discussed at the recent forum of tourism interests that I convened as part of the development of the Department's new statement of strategy.  I have relayed these concerns to the Minister for Finance and will be discussing them with him further in the context of the forthcoming budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">As Minister with responsibility for tourism, I am concerned about the potential for the tax to affect the competitiveness and viability of air routes to Ireland.  From a purely tourism perspective, it would be preferable not to have an air travel tax.  However, I appreciate that the Minister for Finance considers it to be an important revenue saving measure, with an estimated full year yield of €125 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">I assure the Deputies that the issue of the tax is a core part of my discussions with the Minister for Finance ahead of the budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_605">The introduction of this tax in 2009 coincided with a marked decline in the numbers of people coming to the country from the UK, the US and elsewhere.  In Holland, a similar tax was scrapped last year although it was raising more than €300 million because it was felt that €1 billion was being lost to the economy through discouraging people from coming to Holland.  Most other European countries have followed Holland's example.  In view of the marked decline in tourism, the loss of more than 40,000 jobs and the decline of €1 billion in tourism income, surely the Minister and the Government should make every effort possible to remove this tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">Is the Minister aware that Mr. Michael O'Leary, who is now CEO of the biggest airline in Europe, has said that if the tax was scrapped he could bring 6 million extra tourists to Ireland over a five year period and increase employment by 6,000 people?</p>

            <p eId="para_607">Tourist numbers undoubtedly declined since the introduction of the air travel tax.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that the two are related.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_609">A number of things impacted on the decline of tourist numbers.  One is the economy in other European countries and the United States.  The very poor weather at the beginning of this year impacted severely on us and then the volcano affected numbers travelling.  If one throws into that mix the sterling and dollar differentials, one sees that many issues impacted on our tourist numbers.  We do not have direct evidence to say the tax was one of those.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">It would appear that when individual passengers are travelling the tax itself may not be an inhibiting factor in making choices.  However, I understand from meeting with airlines that it impacts on their choice of where to put their routes.  That is an even more significant issue for us.  If aeroplanes are not coming into Ireland, tourists cannot come.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">I met Mr. Christopher Mueller of Aer Lingus and Mr. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair.  I would be interested to hear more specifically from them what they would do if the tax was removed.  If we remove a tax that has the potential to bring in €125 million in a year, we may well have to find that money somewhere else.  They would have to make a very valuable contribution to the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_612">Would the Minister consider suspending the tax for two years and challenging the airlines to bring in extra people?  It would then be in their hands to respond.  The second recommendation of the Minister's own review group was the abolition of air travel tax.  There is little sense is setting up a review group if the Minister does not listen to it or implement its recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">Would the Minister consider putting the tax on hold for two years and giving the airlines an opportunity to increase their figures?</p>

            <p eId="para_614">The tourism review group, the tourism implementation group, the Tourism Forum, the Irish Hotels Federation and various tourism bodies have looked for this tax to be removed on the understanding that it would increase the number of passengers coming into the country.  That is what the airlines are saying they would be able to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">I am quite happy to continue my discussions with the Minister for Finance but I would need to know from Ryanair what we will get in return.  What will we get by way of additional passengers?  What will Ryanair be able to do by way of additional routes into Ireland or making a commitment that routes into Ireland will not be stopped?  That would give me the basis for an argument, in the context of the budget, with the Minister for Finance.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport</b>
           the progress that has been made regarding the oversupply of hotel accommodation and the difficulty being experienced by the sector as a result of the impact of the National Assets Management Agency; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_617">Economic circumstances are making trading conditions difficult for most businesses at present.  These difficult conditions are exacerbated in the case of the hotel sector by the build up of an overcapacity in the availability of rooms in recent years.  This is proving to be a complex situation to resolve and I believe that, inevitably, it will require a market-led solution over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">I had the opportunity earlier this week to have a useful exchange of views with the chairman, the chief executive and other senior executives of NAMA on how their operations may impact on the hotel and overall tourism sectors.  I was accompanied at the discussions by senior officials of my Department and Fáilte Ireland.  I should stress that the engagement with NAMA was at an overall policy level and was not related to any specific enterprise or borrower.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">In order to inform the discussion, Fáilte Ireland had prepared in advance a detailed market analysis which assesses recent supply and demand in the hotel sector in Ireland and examines the possibility of recovery in the medium term.  This analysis was prepared in consultation with the Irish Hotels Federation and will be made public over the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">At the meeting, I voiced my overall concern that there would be a sufficient range and geographical spread of hotels to cater for present and projected tourism demand.  I referred to the significant employment levels in the tourism and hotel sector and the importance of sustaining such jobs.  I also referred to the IHF's concern that the apparent actions of some banks in sustaining non-viable hotels could have the effect of squeezing out some well-established family-run operations.  I encouraged NAMA to be strategic in its approach and I welcomed its willingness to keep in contact with the Department and the tourism agencies at a general policy level as it worked its way through the management of its hotel-backed loans portfolio.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">For its part, NAMA indicated that it had completed the transfer of a number of tranches of loans, which included 35 Irish-based hotels, and had begun its engagement with borrowers in relation to business plans on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">NAMA expects that its portfolio of hotel backed loans will increase further, although not as much as anticipated publicly.  I was pleased to be advised that NAMA has not subsidised loss making hotels nor does it intend to do so.  It accepted the need to adjust to the new market realities and has already met the IHF to allay concerns that it may be acting in an uncompetitive manner or as a monopoly hotel player.  It welcomed the receipt of Fáilte Ireland's analysis of the sector and I am pleased to say it is open to taking account of overall tourism policy considerations as its own strategy evolves.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">Did the Minister discuss the availability of bank credit in the aftermath of Bank of Scotland's withdrawal?  Is she aware that the hotel sector is heavily over-borrowed and is experiencing difficulties in accessing working capital?  I ask her to respond to the press release issued today by the Irish Hotels Federation which expresses concern about the inaction of her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on excessive local authority charges.  The press release states that 180 hotels and guest houses could go out of businesses because of the refusal of county managers under the Minister's direction to negotiate.</p>

            <p eId="para_624">The relationship with other banks arose during my discussions with NAMA, which has a remit to work with AIB and Bank of Ireland.  However, even though it does not have the same relationship with Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank, these banks are also obliged to lend in a prudent and sustainable manner.  I acknowledge that the withdrawal of Bank of Scotland is an issue of considerable concern to hoteliers, particularly in respect of credit availability over the winter months.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">I was struck by the fact that fewer hotels than anticipated are going into NAMA.  It now appears that it will only control between 60 and 70 hotels.  In so far as it has a public policy remit, we can be assured that it will not depress the market by selling them off immediately and it is anxious to take advice on the public policy issue of the range and categories of hotels needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">In regard to the other banks, I do not know if it would be helpful to engage with the Irish Banking Federation but I am happy to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_627">On the positive side, the surplus of bedrooms in this country offers an opportunity for promoting Ireland more aggressively in the UK and elsewhere.  Has the Minister encouraged Tourism Ireland to tell the world how cheap and competitive our hotel rates are at present?  We have an oversupply of rooms according to Peter Bacon and while perhaps some hotels should be closed, that is not going to happen.  Is there a potential for promoting tourism based on our low rates?  However, it is not sustainable for hotels that their rates are back to 1999 levels.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_628">Hotels have to deal with a number of issues, including surplus capacity.  The industry claims to have 15,000 surplus rooms.  Based on our plans to attract up to 8 million tourists by 2015, we estimate a somewhat lower figure for oversupply but none the less it is an issue which will have to be addressed and banks will have to be conscious of market demands.  The economic affairs Cabinet sub-committee has discussed the issue of rates, particularly in so far as they relate to hotels, and I have impressed upon the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the penal nature of these rates for the hotel industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">There is great potential in the British market, which is our most important source of tourists.  We are putting renewed emphasis on the message that we offer better value.  That campaign only began this year, however.  It is unfortunate that people may be criticising our marketing to Britain this year given that we were charging too much for so long.  Fáilte Ireland's success in spreading the message to our domestic market about the great value on offer saved the tourism industry this year and we will see further benefits by next summer.  With the co-operation of the House, I intend to attend the World Travel Market in London in November in order to support the marketing of Ireland and highlight the good value we offer to the British market.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_632">My predecessor announced a decision to set up Irish National Opera, INO, in December 2009 and appointed an interim board to undertake this task.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">The process of forming this new entity is a collaborative one involving my Department, the Arts Council, Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company, OTC.  The latter is fully engaged in that process and is represented on the interim board of INO.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">The new opera company will not be in a position to produce its first full season until 2012 and one of the many challenges to be addressed in that regard is ensuring that public resources are available to meet the ambition of having a world class national opera company in Ireland.  The Government remains committed to that ambition. In ensuring that we reach it we have taken the best advice internationally and the former director of the Welsh National Opera is on the interim board of the INO.  Meanwhile, Opera Theatre Company will continue to produce opera in 2011 and will be funded to do so by the Arts Council.  This has been agreed between the interim board, my Department and the Arts Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">The building of a wider and more informed audience for opera is a crucial task for INO, which will have the mission of bringing opera to all ages and social groups.  OTC has experience in this area and its outreach programme is one of its outputs.  It has a wonderful track record artistically and is well managed.  Regionally, it is the face, voice and sound of opera in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">It is of the utmost importance that future arrangements for opera provision in Ireland are organisationally well grounded and financially sensible, with due consideration given to putting appropriate arrangements and resources in place that will ensure the success of that endeavour over the coming years.  It is also essential that developmental opportunities are provided for Irish opera talent and that we add to our cultural stock internationally.  To this end, my Department and the Arts Council will continue to engage the interim board with a view to achieving a sustainable model for medium to long term opera provision in Ireland.  As previously announced, Opera Ireland will be wound down after its autumn season, as its business model for opera provision is no longer sustainable in the current fiscal and arts funding environment.  However, there will be public provision for opera in 2011.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_637">In light of the fact that Opera Theatre Company operates very successfully across the country, can the Minister assure us that the new national opera company will be able to stage a similar number of performances in the same range of venues?  OTC tours around 18 venues all around the country and it allows many communities to experience opera.  I am concerned that we will have a repeat of our experience of national theatre, which does not leave its home in the Abbey Theatre to tour the country even though it is heavily subsidised by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">OTC runs a tight shop on a budget of approximately €800,000.  I understand OTC and Opera Ireland receive €1.8 million between them but getting the new company up and running will require €4 million.  Where will this money be found?</p>

            <p eId="para_639">In 2010, Opera Ireland will get €1.62 million and OTC will get €643,000, for a combined total of €2.263 million.  It is my intention that the Arts Council will continue to fund OTC next year.  As the Deputy noted, the company staged a considerable number of performances in a variety of venues.  In 2009 alone it staged 42 performances in 28 venues to a live audience of 15,800.  That is exactly what we want opera to do in Ireland.  It must reach out to geographically diverse places and to different social groups.  My intention is to ensure that Opera Ireland will only present a full programme when it is capable of doing so.  In the meantime, we will ensure that Opera Theatre Company continues to be funded.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">It is very important that a new venture have the artistic and creative ability to provide a programme that supports young Irish artists and singers and which can gain international recognition.  To do that, it must have proper staffing and an artistic director, in addition to a very good board and funding.  In anticipation of the fact that no major programme will be capable of being provided until 2012, the best way to proceed is to continue to support next year Opera Theatre Company's current remit of bringing opera all over the country and to wind down Opera Ireland.  This is preferable to beginning something that would not meet any of the requirements.</p>

           the plans in place to celebrate Dublin’s achievement as a United Nations Educational Scientific Cultural Organisation City of Literature; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  
        [36711/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_322" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_647">The plans to celebrate the designation of Dublin as UNESCO City of Literature are anchored by Dublin City Council.  My Department is represented on the steering committee, as are a number of the arts, culture and tourism agencies under its aegis.  As Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, I was very pleased that Dublin was honoured in this way and that the city council's application to UNESCO for the title of Dublin City of Literature was successful.  In that regard, I want to record my appreciation of the work done by the steering and management committee, led by the city council's library services, which prepared the award-winning application.  The compilation of the winning bid was truly a collaborative effort, and demonstrates what can be achieved when agencies pull together.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">The designation as City of Literature is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities network.  Dublin has now joined the select few within the UNESCO Creative Cities Network, namely, Edinburgh, Iowa, and Melbourne.  Dublin, as a UNESCO City of Literature, has enormous potential for beneficial cultural, tourism and economic impacts, not only in the capital city itself but also in communities across the country.  A significant literary component was added to the recent culture night in Dublin, and funded by my Department to mark this magnificent achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">By providing a global platform for a city's local cultural assets, the Creative Cities Network is facilitating access to know-how, information and experiences to all member cities as a means to promote the development of local cultural industries and to foster member cities' worldwide recognition.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">Dublin is currently known across the globe for its writers, from Behan to Stoker and from Doyle to Sheridan.  It has been home, inspiration and subject to generations of the finest writers the world has known.  My Department, and the tourism and cultural agencies under its aegis, will work with Dublin City Council to leverage as much cultural and economic benefit from this designation as we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">At the announcement of the UNESCO designation at our newest theatre, the Grand Canal Theatre, we were able to present a world-class line-up of our Irish literary talent, including poets Thomas Kinsella and Theo Dorgan, in addition to novelists and award winners Joseph O'Connor, Cathy Kelly and Colm Tóibín, and our children's laureate, Siobhán Parkinson, to mention just a few.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">Our literary reputation is not just something imaginary and part of the Dublin mist; it is vibrantly, visibly and abundantly all around us, and the City of Literature designation will allow us to showcase it to the world.  With that in mind Culture Ireland is including a very significant literature component in its cultural programme for North America in 2011.  I will be launching that programme next month in the United States and I have invited the director of the City of Literature organisation to join the trade mission supporting that launch.  In addition, the tourism agencies are heavily promoting the designation.  To date, the response internationally has been impressive.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">My Department and the Arts Council are working closely with Dublin City Council on its programme to mark the designation in 2011 and a measure of co-funding will be made available by me to ensure we capitalise on this opportunity for our literary, cultural and business communities.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_323">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_654">As I mentioned previously, designation has been a major achievement for Dublin.  As the Minister no doubt understands, we could lose the designation also.  I am worried that our literary product in Dublin is rather dispersed.  If one comes to Dublin looking for a literary experience, one must go to different places for it.  The Yeats exhibition in the National Library of Ireland has been very successful but there is an exhibition on James Joyce that is not on display because there is no place to display it.  It should be on display permanently.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">If one considers all our successful writers since the time of Swift, one will realise that there is really nowhere to experience their work.  The Irish Writers Centre has been very successful but it is receiving no funding from the Department or the Arts Council.  Funding for literature amounts to only 4% of the Arts Council's funding, despite the fact that the Indecon report states the multiplier from literature is quite considerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">I ask the Minister to consider seriously setting up a group, perhaps the group that won the designation, to consider making available a building, be it a museum or writers' centre, that would at once celebrate the achievements of past writers and encourage contemporary writers.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">While Newman House on St. Stephen's Green is an option, another option is a building that has become iconic for the wrong reasons, namely the Anglo Irish Bank building, which I hope will be closed soon.  It would be an ideal location and its use as a writers' centre would be positive.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_658">I appreciate what the Deputy is saying about the importance of having permanent exhibitions.  The Yeats exhibition is a great success.  It would be desirable to have a location for a permanent Joyce exhibition.  We can investigate that.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">One reason Dublin was designated was that its literature was not confined to a museum or one location and was a living part of the of the city.  That so many people in Dublin read literature is of note.  When Seamus Heaney brings out a new collection of poetry, it goes immediately to number one.  That does not happen in other countries.  Dublin has many book clubs and children enjoy reading.  That is part of what we do.  The One City, One Book idea is a case in point.  Next year, <i>Ghost Light</i> by Joseph O’Connor will be chosen and this year <i>A Picture of Dorian Gray</i> was chosen.  Designation was because literature, reading and writers are all over the city.  I accept the Deputy’s point on showcasing our Nobel laureates and all our other famous writers.  I will certainly pursue that idea.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_325">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_660">Designation presents a great opportunity for Dublin to promote our many literary geniuses.  I take the opportunity to congratulate Emma Donoghue.  Although Emma Donoghue is not based in Dublin, I congratulate her as she did extremely well to be placed on the shortlist for the Man Booker Prize.  That must be acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">The Minister stated the city's designation is being promoted on the Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland websites but when I looked at them I could not find a reference.  Dublin Tourism has a very good reference to it.  Perhaps I missed something.  If not, it might be worth promoting it.</p>

            <p eId="para_662">I did not say it was on the websites but that it was being promoted as part of tourism promotion.  At various events and conferences, I and others have highlighted the fact that the City of Literature status is a means of attracting visitors.  Dublin Tourism, which is part of the network of tourism agencies, is promoting the concept.  I foresee great opportunities next year under Culture Ireland.  Rather than just promoting Ireland through music, dance and the visual arts, we can include literature also.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_666">The artists' exemption was introduced in 1969 to create an environment in which the arts could flourish.  In 2007, a restriction was applied to the scheme which capped the relief at €250,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">In 2009, the Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of the exemption.  As a result, the scheme was reviewed following which the Minister for Finance announced in last December's budget that, from the 2010 tax year, the restriction of reliefs applicable to the exemption would be changed by imposing a new entry level threshold to the restriction at adjusted income levels of €125,000, with the full restriction applying at €400,000.  This change was effected in the Finance Act 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">On Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2010, the Minister for Finance announced the further review of the effectiveness of sectoral tax expenditures with the results feeding into the 2011 budget.  This review required an assessment to be undertaken by Ministers into the effectiveness of tax expenditures within their sectors of responsibility that were examined by the Commission on Taxation.  This review has been completed and was sent to the Minister for Finance earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">The artists' exemption scheme, which has been in place now for 40 years, marks Ireland out as unique in Europe in its support for its artists.  The rationale behind the legislation was, <i>inter alia</i>, to create an environment in which the arts could flourish and to encourage Irish artists on modest incomes to remain here rather than go abroad to earn their living.  The scheme has been of great benefit and provides encouragement for artists on modest incomes to practice their creative skills.  In fact, most of those benefiting are on relatively low incomes.  In 2007, 69% of those who benefited from the exemption had incomes of less than €20,000 per annum; 77% had an income of less than €30,000 and 82% had an income of less than €40,000.  I have no plans to have any further review of the scheme carried out at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_670">I support the tax exemption scheme for artists because I believe it is important.  We could perhaps examine how it is distributed.  Perhaps, it could be distributed over a number of years because often an artist might earn a great deal of money in one year from, for example, a piece of sculpture, and may not earn anything for three or four more years.  The Minister indicated there will be further changes to the scheme in the forthcoming budget.  Does she know at what level the exemption will be capped?</p>

            <p eId="para_672">I must have misinterpreted what the Minister said.  As she pointed out, the majority of people who benefit from the artists' tax exemption earn below €50,000 per annum.  Why then are we putting such a high cap of €125,000 on it?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_673">I did not say the amount would be reviewed again this year.  I said that tax expenditures generally were being reviewed by the Minister for Finance.  I do not think he intends to review the artists' tax exemption.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">The limit of €125,000 was set in last year's budget.  As I stated, 82% of people who benefit from the tax exemption earn €40,000 per annum or less.  The €125,000 limit was put in place to ensure people in the higher income bracket contribute to taxation.  The number of people in this category is quite small.  In 2006, 1,300 people had an income of less than €10,000.  Some 50% of all artists earn less than that amount.  Fewer than 200 people earned more than €125,000.  Only the people in that bracket were affected.  This was part of an overall policy to hit the higher income earner rather than the lower income earner.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">I appreciate what the Deputy had to say in respect of an artist who might spend some time working on a particular piece and who might not do any work the following year.  I am reluctant to suggest we change the scheme at all lest people think we would like to change it entirely.</p>

           her plans to conduct a national audit of arts and cultural facilities to guide future capital investment in the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_338" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_681">In 2008, my Department commenced an audit of sports facilities at local level in line with a commitment in the programme for Government.  The audit was carried out with the assistance of local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  At the time it was decided to take the opportunity to gather information on publicly funded arts and community facilities in local authority areas.  Guidelines were issued to the local authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.  The local authorities have since submitted their returns which contain records of arts facilities in each area.  The returns received from local authorities are being collated into a database and are being cross-checked against the Department's arts and culture capital programme records.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">When this work is completed, the Department will assess what additional necessary actions would be required to complete a full national audit of arts and cultural facilities.  In the meantime, many local authorities are publishing the information they received during the course of the audits.  Access to this information is available on some local authority websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">Since 2004, the Department has spent €132 million in capital support for 120 arts centres, galleries, museums and theatres.  It is fair to say that this six-year period has seen the single largest period of sustained investment in arts infrastructure in the history of the State.  In that time venues from the award winning Wexford Festival Opera to the Model Niland in Sligo, and from the Gate and the Abbey in Dublin to the Druid in Galway have received investment.  Truly, as we face into the second decade of the 21st century, we have a world class arts infrastructure, and it is not all Dublin based.  There is much more to achieve and the primary challenge I face now is ensuring an adequacy of public resources to maintain activity levels at these wonderful venues.  In 2009 alone, capital support was provided to 48 venues.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_339">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_684">Again, I am not proposing there should be any more major capital investment at this time.  The main issue is, the need to ensure the proper services and activities are provided.  It has been pointed out to me that many art centres and festivals do not have computerised box offices or marketing systems.  This is an area in which there could be investment.  I do believe we need any more buildings as we have more than enough of them.  Many of the buildings we have are excellent and are a great credit to us as a country.  The question that arises and which arose in previous discussions is how the people in the arts and culture are to be supported and sustained in their jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">I do not understand the reason it takes so long to collate information to provide an audit of facilities.  The Minister might recall the same problem arose with portakabins in schools.  Why does it take so long to put this information together?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_340" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_686">I can understand why it would take so long to collate information in regard to schools because there are 4,000 of them.  I do not understand, however, why it took the council so long to collate information on art and culture facilities of which there are only 33.  From an arts point of view, we will not have a complete picture because the council will deal only with local authority funded facilities.  There are a large number of private ventures.  We have information on the national cultural institutions.  The audit will not include facilities such as private galleries which contribute to the arts.  I accept the argument that the key issue now is to ensure these facilities can function and can be used to put on shows, attract audiences and improve participation.  This is my major consideration leading into the budget discussions.</p>

            <p eId="para_689">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 27 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The renewed programme for Government commits us to a detailed assessment of the GPO complex in the context of locating the Abbey Theatre there in time for the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  The development of a new national theatre project is a not a simple undertaking.  There is a matrix of technical, procedural and legal factors to address in making progress on it.  Trying to build a national theatre at the GPO, with all of the history that embraces that building, adds to the complexity and also needs particular sensibilities to history, tradition and the iconography of the GPO.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">A feasibility group of the primary stakeholders has been set up.  Its membership includes representatives from my Department, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, An Post and the Abbey Theatre.  The group has made considerable progress in assessing the GPO complex to ascertain whether it is a feasible location for the redeveloped national theatre.  Among the main considerations assessed are the capacity of the GPO to accommodate the brief agreed for the Abbey Theatre; the integration of theatre infrastructure into the street and skyscape; the feasibility from a planning perspective of any redevelopment proposal; the cost of the construction, the nature of the title to the site and the terms and conditions of leases, indentures, mortgages, liens, etc., thereon; and the costs of lease terminations and other commercial and corporate issues for An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">A draft report is nearing completion.  That draft report will then be circulated to the members of the feasibility group for final input.  I anticipate it will be a number of weeks before this process is completed and the final report is ready for submission to me and to the  Government.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_697">Various sites were mentioned in connection with the possible relocation of the Abbey, including Grand Canal Dock, George's Dock, the Carlton Hotel, Coláiste Mhuire on Parnell St., Hawkins House, etc.  It was also suggested that the existing theatre could be refurbished and extended by means of the purchase of some of the surrounding buildings.  Relocating the Abbey to the GPO is the latest suggestion.  I appeal to the Minister to, if nothing else, reach a decision on whether the theatre should be relocated.  It is important that this should be done because the speculation that is taking place is not helping anybody.  Is the Minister in a position to provide a timeframe with regard to when the feasibility study is likely to be completed?  How much money has been spent on the study to date?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_347" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_698">The difficulty with this project is that it does not merely involve a simple question as to whether it is feasible to relocate the Abbey Theatre to the GPO building.  If we receive a report which indicates that it is feasible to do so, the next question we must contemplate is whether we wish to proceed.  I would welcome the views of other Members in respect of that matter.  We want to find the best possible location for the Abbey Theatre.  This must be a city centre location and, therefore, the GPO is an option.  On the other hand, the GPO was a post office in 1916 and there is a great deal to be said for retaining it as such for the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">On culture night I was struck by the hundreds, if not thousands, of people who visited the GPO to view the historical exhibits.  There is a real sense of the place of that building in the history of the nation and I do not want anything to subtract from that.  I am not stating that relocating the Abbey Theatre to the GPO would do so but we must certainly consider that aspect of the matter.  There are historical, political and cultural elements which must be taken into account and these must be placed over and above the results of a study which might indicate that the theatre will fit in the GPO.  Until I know whether it will fit and until I am fully briefed on all of the planning and legal issues involved, it will not be possible to make a decision.  I would genuinely like to hear, either on a confidential basis or otherwise, the views of other Members in respect of where they believe the theatre should be located.  This matter is not about me or my Department — it relates to one of the most iconic and significant buildings in the country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_348">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_700">There is a serious element of putting the cart before the horse in respect of this matter.  Whoever decided to proceed with the feasibility study should first have considered whether we want the theatre to be relocated to the GPO.  If a decision had been taken that the relocation should proceed, then we could have moved forward with the feasibility study.  If we had decided not to relocate the theatre to the GPO, then we could have proceeded to reconsider the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the docklands site.  The cart has very definitely been placed before the horse.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">There is no point in asking Members for their thoughts.  We are well down the road with regard to the feasibility study.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, when commenting on a report relating to a relocation to the docklands, provided a figure of €219,000 in respect of the work that had been already carried out.  What is going to be the final cost of the current feasibility study?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_349" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_702">Let us be under no illusions.  Relocating the Abbey Theatre would cost a significant amount of money.  However, if this is the correct thing to do — obviously any move would have to be considered in the context of the state of the public finances — then we should proceed.  I am of the view that this issue is much larger than mere planning or logistics considerations.  We cannot consider the big question until we know whether a relocation to the GPO would be possible.  There would be no point in engaging in a political, cultural or historical debate in respect of the future of the GPO and deciding the relocation of the Abbey Theatre there should proceed, only to discover that such a relocation would not be possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">I accept that the expenditure of money is a significant issue at present.  However, it is worth spending money in order to establish what the future might hold for the Abbey Theatre.  The closer we come to 2016, the more conscious people are becoming not only of our future but also of our past.  People want to preserve the best parts of our history.  One of the best ways of reminding people — in a physical sense and not just in the context of the ideals of those who rose up in 1916 — of our past is to highlight the part played in it by the GPO.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">There are those who will state that we should implement the ideals espoused in the 1916 Proclamation and we can, of course, do so.  However, it must be noted that the GPO is a symbol of idealism and republicanism and we do not want to do anything which would detract from this.  Having said that, the relocation of the Abbey Theatre to the GPO might contribute to rather than subtract from the symbolism relating to the site.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_705">Will the Minister indicate the cost of the feasibility study to date?  Is she in a position to indicate the amount of money that has been spent on feasibility studies since her predecessor, Síle de Valera, first examined the possibility of relocating the theatre to the Grand Canal Dock area?</p>
            <p eId="para_706">A large range of artefacts and exhibits are currently stored — they are not on show — in Collins Barracks.  I am sure these could be exhibited in the GPO.  It would be interesting to discover whether it would be possible to put on such an exhibition if the Abbey Theatre were relocated to the building.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">The GPO is an iconic building.  There are two iconic figures in this country who appear to have different views on the relocation of the Abbey Theatre.  The first is Senator Norris, who wants the theatre to be relocated to the GPO, and the second is the great Ulick O'Connor, who is very much opposed to moving it from its current location.  Which of these individuals is influencing the Minister's thinking at this stage?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_351" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_708">It would ill become me to come between Ulick O'Connor and Senator Norris.  To date, €393,509.62 has been paid out by the Department in respect of the design, engineering, architectural, financial and legal fees relating to the new Abbey Theatre project.  The majority of this expenditure is project as opposed to site specific.  Irrespective of what development takes place in respect of the Abbey — and regardless of where it occurs — much of the money relating to the study can be carried on and will not be lost.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">What is the current position with regard to the feasibility study?  When will it be completed?  We must continue with the study and we cannot just drop it now.  Meetings relating to this matter have been taking place over many years.  In such circumstances, the study must be almost complete.  I do not know whether we should have parallel debates on this issue.  I take on board many of the Minister's points in respect of the historical and cultural significance of the GPO.  The latter are important considerations and there are many shades of opinion in respect of them.  What will happen, however, if we engage in a debate on whether the theatre should be relocated to the GPO and reach the conclusion that we should not proceed with this option?  Will the feasibility study be dropped?  Will we state that even though it is 75% complete, it should be abandoned because it is a waste of time and money?  What is happening is illogical.</p>

            <p eId="para_710">Deputy Upton almost contradicted herself.  We are awaiting the results of the feasibility study because we want to discover whether the relocation might be possible.  There are issues which arise in the context of size and scale.  There is also the fact that approximately 25 retail units are located in the GPO and these all have commercial leases.  All of these issues would require to be resolved.  In the knowledge that such a resolution might be possible, it then would be possible to engage in a political, social, cultural and historical debate in respect of the matter.  I anticipate that the feasibility study will be completed and sent to me shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">I propose to take Question Nos. 11 and 16 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">I wish to reassure Deputies that the Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and creative industries to Irish society and to our economy.  We are conscious not only of the role of the sector in providing vital opportunities for self-expression and participation but also of the economic potential of the arts and creative industries.  We are determined to do our best to provide the conditions in which creative expression can flourish and are committed to enhancing access to the arts for people of all ages and income levels.  My policy on the arts, culture and film sectors reflects Government policy in this area as set out in the programme for Government.  This policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life and maximise the potential for cultural tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">I am committed to supporting the crucial constituent sectors of arts and culture and the Government will continue to fund those sectors within limited available financial resources.  Decisions regarding funding, whether within my Department's Vote or on the part of other relevant Departments will, however, have to be taken in the context of the ongoing Estimates and budget preparation process and in the light of the target aggregate Exchequer savings to be achieved for 2011.  I would like to acknowledge the concerns raised by the recent campaign for the arts and to affirm my commitment to maximising the position and status of the arts in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">Unusually for protestors, I have to commend those who participated in the public display of arts activities on 17  September last.  This was undertaken by the National Campaign for the Arts and even included many Members of this House.  The campaign helped to highlight the value, importance, contribution and community reach of the arts not only to the economy and to our social life but also to raising the national spirit.  The arts help to define what we are, both as a community and on the world stage.  I intend to do everything in my power to build on the passion displayed by the campaign and to ensure the continued vitality of this sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">I reiterate that the arts are important from both an economic and a social point of view and I will ensure that this importance is highlighted in the decisions which must be taken to determine the 2011 allocation for arts and culture.  As Minister, I will put forward the strongest possible case that I can for the sector and advocate continuing State support for it.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">I agree that the campaign was very successful, and participants met 83 Members, with approximately 11,000 e-mails sent out to support the campaign.  The first element of the campaign looked to retain Arts Council funding at current levels.  The Minister has already indicated she cannot give any guarantees in that respect but I am sure she will make a really strong case for the retention of the funding.  I remember when the funding was cut by €5 million in 2002, the process was upset and it took the Arts Council and related organisations a long time to recover from that.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">I accept all the arguments made by the group.  The campaign was designed not just to protect the budget but also to inform public opinion and unite all the arts groups.  They had not done this in the past but they were challenged to do so by the McCarthy report last year, and this has been a benefit both to the groups and everybody else.  Instead of seeing each other as competitors, the groups saw themselves as complementary to each other, with a great service done to themselves and society in general as a result.  The other factor which benefited their campaign significantly was the Farmleigh process.  A global network focused on culture and its importance to the economy has raised the arts to a new level.</p>

            <p eId="para_722">I agree with the Minister's comments on the protection of the arts and Deputy Deenihan's contribution.  It is important in a cultural way, and the people engaged in the arts do so because they love it rather than it being a job.  They want to do it and beyond almost any other profession they have a total commitment to the sector.  As I mentioned when discussing the arts exemption, many of these people are poorly paid.  Another significant point is the number who are employed in the area and the spin-off to the economy.  I urge that the money be protected in the budget.  It is a soft target and I am concerned that it might suffer as a result.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">I echo the comments of the two previous speakers.  I know the Minister is going to Ballaghaderreen tomorrow morning to talk about the creative economy.  In light of the fact that research from the Western Development Commission has shown that 4,475 businesses are in the creative economy in the western region, employing 11,000 people, as well as the impact of the Farmleigh process and the Your Country, Your Call competition, will the Minister carry out an economic assessment of the impact of the arts on the economy?  It would support the argument to ring-fence the funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_724">We do not need to carry out such an assessment as we recognise that approximately 50,000 people are employed in the sector, either directly or indirectly.  It is about the economy and the contribution to society.  I will certainly be making that case for the budget.  I am going to Ballaghaderreen in the morning to speak about culture, the European Market for Tourism at lunch and the GAA All-Stars tomorrow night.  It is a great job.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_731">I was speaking recently with an employer in the tree services industry in the Waterford constituency who in 2009 took three people off the live register and also took on two people who had just lost their jobs.  Some six or seven weeks ago he met a young man who is a qualified block layer but who had been unemployed.  The young man asked this particular employer for employment.  The employer decided that he would take him on and in order to do so, he needed to undergo a training course which the employer set up and paid for.  The course cost £912.  The young man began on Monday, 27 September and concluded on Friday, 1 October. He further underwent his assessment for his City and Guilds qualification on Monday, 4 October.  When this young man went to collect his jobseeker's allowance he was told that he did not quality for that week.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">Against the background of 450,000 people unemployed nationally and 15,000 unemployed in the Waterford constituency, surely every effort should be made by Departments and State agencies to assist in every way in getting unemployed people into employment.  This was a case where there was a job waiting for the person involved, the employer paid for his pre-employment training and the Department of Social Protection was not prepared to pay the jobseeker's allowance to this young man while he was preparing for employment.  The employer provided a letter outlining the position regarding the course and stated that the young man had been in receipt of no payment.  The employer in this case went on to tell me that in his view, 1,500 positions can be created in the tree servicing sector nationally but that employers need assistance in terms of grant aid towards the provision of the required training for people to enter this industry, where although the work is hard, the pay is relatively good.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">Every person who returns to work on average benefits the Exchequer to the tune of €20,000.  In the present crisis Departments and agencies must be flexible and prompt in supporting the areas of the economy where jobs can be created.  Companies such as the one I describe pay tax and PRSI into the Exchequer and the more people they employ, the better the return to the State.  Not alone is the qualification in regard to the course that I have already mentioned one that is required in Ireland but it is a City and Guilds qualification recognised throughout the world.  The qualification described is in regard to the use of chainsaws and if an employer in this industry decides to upskill employees there should be grant aid assistance available against the background of the employer paying for the course, paying the employee's wages and not having production from that employee in the week of the course.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">I am calling on the Minister to take a much more enlightened view on such situations.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture_and_Sport" eId="spk_367">
            <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_735">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Haughey, Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning.  I would like to thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  He referred to a specific case on which I am not able to comment.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">In the prevailing economic circumstances, the Government's priority in response to the number of people who are unemployed has been to assist these individuals to get back into employment.  It doubled the job search support capacity of FÁS this year to over 154,000 referrals from the national employment action plan.  From a training and education perspective this year, the Department of Education and Skills will be providing over 160,000 training and employment places for the unemployed compared to the 66,000 places provided in 2008.  It will also provide 170,000 full-time and part-time further education places and 156,000 full-time higher education places.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">All higher education programmes covered by the free fees scheme are open to unemployed persons.  Included in this provision are new measures and approaches such as the work placement programme which provides up to nine months work experience to the unemployed and the labour market activation fund, which was an open call for proposals for education and training provision for the unemployed.  Under the fund a total of 59 providers from the public, private and community and voluntary sectors are being supported and will provide approximately 11,500 places.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">However, the Government is equally committed to ensuring levels of employment and national competitiveness are maintained, and increased where possible, through the training and upskilling of those persons who are in work.  The current budget for training persons in employment is €82.4 million.  Of this €5.4 million funds the FÁS services to business programme while €77 million funds the FÁS apprenticeship programme.  In addition, a budget of €16.6 million is available in 2010 to the Skillnets training networks programme from the national training fund.  This funding is matched by funds from the companies involved in the training networks programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The Skillnets training networks programme facilitates the creation of learning networks of groups of companies operating in the same industrial sector or geographical area.  The companies co-operate as a group to provide training which individual companies would be unable to undertake acting alone.  Some 70 networks are funded and engaging in Skillnets training activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The Skillnets model is an enterprise-led approach to training and development.  It supports the development of flexible and effective training delivery methods among those enterprises which previously had difficulty in accessing or benefiting from training.  It also aims to address the lack of investment in human resources development and training by business through tackling some of the real and perceived barriers to training.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">Skillnets does not specify the type or scope of training but supports the networks with resources and expertise.  Networks arrange relevant, cost-effective and innovative training courses for their member companies.  The key difference in the Skillnets approach is that the enterprise itself has total decision-making power and can customise training to its specific needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The Skillnets approach is cross-regional, cross-sectoral and firmly grounded in the strength and synergies of networking.  Networks are self-selecting and guided by a commonality of need.  Decision-making is devolved to the level of the industry group or other network grouping so as to maximise enterprise involvement in all aspects of delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">This leadership by industry has been one of the most important and effective success factors of the training networks programme.  It has been key to the uptake of training from 1999 to 2009 by over 240,000 employees in more than 50,000 companies.  In 2009, Skillnets trained some 40,000 persons and its target this year is to train over 60,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">In the current training networks programme, an innovative feature, given the prevailing economic context, is the expansion of the trainee profile to include unemployed participants.  Up to €1 million has been set aside by Skillnets again this year for the Finuas training networks programme to provide appropriate in-employment training in the international financial services sector.  Specific skills gaps are being identified with over 1,200 persons trained in the sector and over 6,500 training days delivered in some 170 participating member companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">The Department of Education and Skills also funds the Engineers Ireland continuing professional development programme.  Another important support to employers in growing their business is provided by the county and city enterprise boards which can assist in the establishment and development of new and existing enterprises.  The forms of financial assistance which are available include priming grants, expansion and development grants and feasibility and innovation study grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">A large range of training and education grant aid and support programmes are available for those in employment, as well as for those who are unemployed.  It is the Government's intention to sustain and broaden the national skills base through the judicious application of these types of programmes.</p>

          <heading>Garda Vetting of Personnel</heading>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_368">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_747">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accepting this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for being present to take it.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">A serious issue if not immediately resolved will result in Elphin Day Care Centre, County Roscommon, having to close its day-care service for the elderly.  The centre depends on four members of staff provided through the FÁS community employment scheme.  There has been a significant turnover in staff over the past two years as they have either successfully obtained regular employment arising from their time at the centre, come to the end of their eligibility for a community employment scheme placement or have availed of maternity leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Persons offered work at the centre are not permitted by FÁS to take up their placements until their vetting process has been completed.  Notwithstanding the absolute necessity of having a proper Garda clearance process and the need to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of that process, it seems incredible that the widely recognised delays in the system have still not been resolved by FÁS and the Garda Síochána.  In the past, the centre struggled when the employment of new staff was delayed by six months because of the length of time taken to process Garda clearance.  This has even happened with individuals who have always lived in the local community.  Last November, the centre interviewed a young person who had never lived elsewhere but had to wait until May 2010 for her clearance.  In another case, an individual already had Garda clearance from previous employment but it took a considerable time for the clearance to issue this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">The management of the day care centre held interviews for three new members of staff on 12 June 2010 but is still waiting to hear from the Garda if the candidates have been given the required clearance.  Two of these candidates will fill vacancies that the centre has struggled to cover over several months while the third will fill a maternity leave vacancy arising in the next two weeks.  The centre, run by a voluntary committee, cannot afford to pay three staff on an ongoing basis.  If these three staff are not in place in the next few weeks, the centre will have to reduce services available or close the day-care facility.  This would result in the loss of the drop-in facility, cooked lunches and meals on wheels.  Those affected will also include several elderly people who began to use the centre when the Plunkett Home facility in Boyle, run by the Health Service Executive, was forced to close last March due to government cutbacks.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">While this is a significant issue facing the people of Elphin, it is replicated across the country.  Such vital services are replacing State-run services or filling a vacuum due to the lack of State-run services for older people.  Community and voluntary services, such as the Elphin one, are struggling to fill vacancies because of the delays in the vetting process, however.  They should not be forced into possible closure due to the delays in processing Garda clearance requests.  While I want the Minister to expedite this specific case, I hope he will ensure it will not be replicated elsewhere.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_369">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_752">I fully appreciate the reasons Deputy Naughten has raised this issue.  He will be aware of the current pressures on the Garda vetting service due to the large increase in recent times in the number of applications for vetting.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The Garda central vetting unit provides employment-vetting to organisations which are registered for this purpose and which employ or engage persons, whether in a paid or voluntary capacity, for posts where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children or to vulnerable adults.  This includes persons engaged by FÁS on community employment schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">As a large number of organisations are registered for vetting purposes, the vetting unit endeavours to provide vetting as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">However, there are particular factors which affect the timeframe for replying to each application which I will mention in my reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The vetting procedure commences with a written request for vetting from a registered organisation, such as FÁS, made with the consent of the person in question.  The Garda vetting unit is thus authorised to release criminal history information in respect of the person concerned to the registered organisation.  It is important that I emphasise, however, that Garda vetting is only one element of the overall recruitment process.  There will always be a range of other factors which a recruiting body or organisation should take into account when coming to a decision on a person's suitability.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">There has been a marked increase in the last number of years in the demand for vetting services.  This is the most important factor which affects the response time to a vetting request.  There are also seasonal variations in the number of applications submitted.  In response to this increased demand, the Garda vetting unit has undergone a very significant expansion.  This expansion has enabled it to growth to the point where it dealt with almost 250,000 applications last year, an increase from a level of 137,000 in 2006.  The Garda authorities anticipate an approximate total of 325,000 applications will be made this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">The expansion of the Garda vetting service continues apace by way of a phased roll-out to other organisations in the child and vulnerable adult care sectors.  The House will understand why this target group is, and must remain, the clear priority from a policy point of view.  The Garda vetting unit treats all vetting applications with equal thoroughness given the necessity to protect those groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">There are approximately 18,000 organisations in receipt of vetting services from the Garda vetting unit, covering a wide range of health, educational, sporting and recreational sectors in Ireland.  The demand for vetting is growing constantly.  The Garda authorities deserve credit for achieving the expansion to date in the vetting service to bring it to its current levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">There are, however, significant pressures facing the delivery of the service in the current conditions and my Department and the Garda authorities are working together to seek to address these.  The partnership approach that the Garda authorities have adopted with the various organisations availing of the service will also help to ensure that vetting requirements can be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">The average processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase greatly.  In any individual case additional time may be required to process a vetting application where clarification or further information is required or where other inquiries need to be made, for example when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">The Garda authorities indicate that the average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the vetting unit may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to up to 12 weeks at times when demand is particularly high, as is the case at the current time.  The Garda vetting unit has advised the registered organisations of the processing timeframe and of the necessity to take this into account in their recruitment and selection processes.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application, given the nature of the checks which are needed and the importance of ensuring the process is carried out thoroughly.  However, the Garda makes every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">With the expansion of the vetting service, significant additional resources have been deployed to the vetting unit.  There are currently 88 personnel assigned to the vetting unit, including six gardaí and 82 civilian personnel and ten additional temporary personnel who were recruited in recent months in order to deal with the high volume of applications.  The number of staff was 13 before the process of development of the unit which began in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">Nevertheless, I and the Garda authorities are determined that as effective a vetting system as possible is provided.  In that context, the overall staffing arrangements at the vetting unit are kept under constant review in the light of the increasing demands being made upon the Garda vetting service by the registered organisations.  I will raise the cases to which the Deputy referred with the Garda vetting unit.</p>

          <heading>Pension Provisions</heading>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_370">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_765">My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, from Cork South-Central, sought an Adjournment matter for the past two days on the problems surrounding defined benefit pension schemes and, in particular, the problems of pensioners who are coming very close to retirement age within months or years.  This is an enormous issue around the country but when I was in Cork last week I had the opportunity to meet several delegations of workers in various employments, many of whom have almost 40 years of service and are now looking at a pension, under the current rules, which will be about half of the pension they might have looked forward to and expected to get three years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">Given the constant flow of people approaching pensionable age, once they are close to 40 years there is not a lot they can do.  As they are defined benefit pension schemes, once they retire under the current regulations, as the Minister is aware, they are obliged to purchase an annuity.  The Minister made a number of announcements on Wednesday when he spoke to the Irish Association of Pension Funds.  He announced a longer framework for a defined benefit schemes which would allow schemes to take account of new provisions, in other words to extend the deadline, which was to have been November, to provide the restructuring and that is welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">However, there is still a problem for somebody who retires tomorrow as he or she has to purchase an annuity and, as the Minister is aware, the rules of most pension funds require that the annuity is purchased by reference to the highest rated bonds, which generally speaking are German bonds, with those of other European countries with very high ratings.  The Minister will know the interest rates are very low at approximately 2.5% whereas the current interest rate on Irish Government bonds is much higher and is unfortunately closer to 6%.  This means that one requires a very large capital sum from the pension fund to purchase an annuity at the very low rates available from German bonds.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">There has been a series of proposals from a number of different organisations involved in pensions, including the Society of Actuaries, suggesting that the Minister should allow flexibility.  There are several different kinds of flexibility involved.  The first is not to force the new retiree to purchase the annuity immediately or to purchase all of the annuity immediately, rather to give him or her time and space.  The second is to examine, as has been suggested by the Society of Actuaries, the notion of a sovereign Irish bond which would potentially provide a much higher rate of interest.  I do not think the Minister would anticipate, if such a bond was developed, issuing it at  current Irish Government market interest rates but it could be at the German rate plus a percentage to reflect the fact that, for reasons of which the Government is aware, a higher risk premium is demanded for Irish debt and the purchase of same.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">On the pace of pension reform in Ireland, people are terrified.  They were looking forward to a reliable pension of a certain level as they moved into retirement.  In many cases half of that expectation is gone and the Government shows absolutely no urgency in addressing the matter.  Defined contribution schemes have seen more flexibility.  A business owner or director can avail of special pension fund systems like approved retirement schemes.  Again, there is quite an amount of flexibility in those schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">I urge the Minister to address this pressing issue immediately.  In starting to address it, it is critical to provide for flexibility.  We know we are in a fairly disastrous period in our economic history but we hope this will not continue forever.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_371">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_771">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I agree with her that it is very important.  I assure her that I will be, and that I have been, directing quite an amount of attention to the matter.  However, it is quite complex and it is important in the decisions we make that we look at all of the various angles.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge their accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  At the end of 2009, there were 254,325 members in 1,212 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard.  It is estimated that more than 75% of these schemes are in deficit.  However, the full extent of the level of underfunding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.  These assessments are carried out through the completion of actuarial funding certificates which evaluate the funding position of a scheme and include confirmation as to whether the funding standard is satisfied.  Where schemes do not satisfy the funding standard, the sponsors or trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within a specified time period, normally three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">The Government is acutely aware of the pressures on sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees that have arisen from investment decisions and changing market conditions.  The Government has taken a number of significant measures to ease the pressures on pension schemes since 2008.  These measures include the granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals and allowing longer periods for recovery plans, up to ten years or more, subject to the agreement of the Pensions Board.  The deadline for the submission of funding proposals was initially extended for six months and has been further extended on a number of occasions.  The current deadline for receipt of funding proposals is the end of November 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">Also introduced were significant legislative changes in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 to allow for the restructuring of underfunded schemes; to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme; and to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board in ensuring that pension contributions are remitted by employers to scheme trustees.  These amendments improved the level of protection that was in place for current and former scheme members who had yet to reach normal retirement age.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The 2009 Act also introduced the legislative provisions to enable the Minister for Finance to establish the pensions insolvency payments scheme to reduce the cost of purchasing pensions for trustees where the employer has become insolvent.  This scheme came into effect in February 2010 and will ensure a more equitable distribution of assets following the wind up of relevant underfunded pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">The national pensions framework was launched by the Government in March 2010.  As Deputy Burton knows, the framework is the Government's plan for future pension reform in Ireland and it encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform.  It aims to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.  The framework is committed to examining new models for the future of defined benefit pension schemes to ensure the sustainability of this pension model.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">As Members are aware, I announced yesterday that the Government is expediting the framework proposal to move to a new defined benefits model.  As the Deputy knows, the framework recognised the difficulties with the current design of defined benefit schemes and proposed an alternative approach to the design.  My Department will aim to introduce this new model, following legislative changes, on 1 July 2011.  This is a very tight timeframe.  On the basis of this decision, the pensions regulator has announced that the deadline of 30 November for the phased submission of recovery plans is being extended further.  This is in order to give schemes time to consider the impact of this new model on their funding position before they are required to submit a recovery plan.  The Pensions Board will shortly announce the details of this extended timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">In developing the new defined benefits model we will look at issues regarding the governance of defined benefit schemes and the basis for the funding standard, including areas such as risk management, and smoothing out effects of changes in the bond markets.  Strategies for transitioning schemes to this new model will also be examined.  Full consultation will, of course, take place with the pensions industry, employers, trade union and other stakeholders in developing the new model.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">Once this new model is introduced and schemes have been given this additional time to develop funding proposals, we do not envisage continuing to revisit the position — in other words, there will be no further extensions.  These measures should not be viewed as a silver bullet.  Pension schemes still have to address their liabilities, their risks and their investment strategies in order to ensure that they are properly funded and we expect them to do that.  The proposal for a sovereign annuity is also being given serious consideration.  However, it must be stressed that the issue is by no means straightforward and an assessment of the benefits and risks involved for all stakeholders is ongoing.  I hope the Government will be in a position to make a decision on this in the near future.</p>

          <heading>Community and Voluntary Sector</heading>
          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_372">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_780">In the words of the Government's White Paper, the community and voluntary sector "contributes to a democratic pluralist society, provides opportunities for the development of decentralised and participative structures and fosters a climate in which the quality of life can be enhanced for all".  It is clear that it plays an important role.  The sector operates from the ground up and is strongly represented in areas where unemployment is high and State services and infrastructure are low.  This is the case in areas of Tallaght, which is the Acting Chairman's area, and in many areas in my constituency of Dublin Central.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">It is estimated that the sector employs approximately 50,000 people and delivers a wide range of vital programmes, including child care, care of the elderly, disability services, health care, social inclusion, homelessness services, skills training, family supports, drug rehabilitation, homework clubs and sporting activities.  Without a vibrant voluntary and community sector, the bonding in society would erode very rapidly and we would end up with conflict and chaos.  It is what keeps society together not only in the good times, but particularly in the bad times when there are pressures and people find it difficult to makes ends meet.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">Over the past two years, the voluntary and community sector has suffered disproportionately from Government cuts.  In 2009, funds for those essential services decreased by 8%.  In 2010, the decrease was even worse at 10%.  Already, local projects have suffered from redundancies, pay cuts and reduced services.  It is estimated that by the end of 2010 there will be more than 5,000 job losses in the sector.  With savage cuts in the two most recent budgets and four more years of austerity budgets to come to try to reach the 3% deficit target, the immediate future is very black indeed.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">This week, we debated the Labour Party Private Members' motion on fuel poverty and spoke about how the ESB disconnects 2,500 homes every month and how Bord Gáis has disconnected approximately 4,000 homes this year because people cannot afford to pay their energy bills.  We also spoke about that fact that while we introduced a carbon tax, we did not provide a corollary fuel poverty strategy whereby the money raised by the State would, to a large extent, be re-injected into the community where it is badly needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">No wonder the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice today indicated in its new study that a high proportion of Irish families cannot afford the basics required for a minimum standard of living.  That is a terrible reflection on us as a country and the manner in which we conduct our business because Ireland is far from a poor country.  It is not good enough that we are unable to prevent a sizeable percentage of the people from falling into poverty, homelessness and a situation of hopelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">There is a need, more than anything else, to look at why all of these people who are falling through the net, and at the experience of abject poverty and what that entails in feeding a family, keeping a roof, keeping heat, looking after the elderly, fuel poverty, education and all of the aspects that bond society.  More than anything else, the Government, and the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs which is largely responsible for the funding of this sector, should endeavour that this time round there would not be further cuts but that at least we would maintain the current levels of service and funding.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryWhite" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Equality_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_373">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Mary Alexandra White)</from>
            <p eId="para_786">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to this Adjournment matter in the Dáil this evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">My Department's mandate aims to progress the achievement of an inclusive society with vibrant communities in which families may thrive.  Measures to support this are contained in the Government's strategies for social and economic development and social inclusion.  The primary role of my Department in the community and voluntary sector is to encourage and facilitate communities, with a special focus on areas of disadvantage, to pursue social and economic progress in their areas.  Policy initiatives are underpinned by the Towards 2016 partnership agreement, which recognises the valuable role of the sector.  The agreement notes that the great strength of voluntary activity is that it emerges organically from communities and points out that while the Government should not seek to control and be involved in every aspect of voluntary activity, it has a responsibility to provide an enabling framework to help the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">To this end, my Department supports a wide range of initiatives that support the work of the sector.  In particular, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the following schemes that directly support their operations.  Under the scheme for national organisations within the community and voluntary sector, 64 organisations within the sector are supported and funding of the order of €5 million is being provided for the scheme in 2010.  My Department has been reviewing the operation and scope of the scheme over the past few months and I will be considering various options in relation to its future in the coming weeks.  Funding of €878,000 is also provided to support the sector in its work under partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">Encouraging volunteering and supporting active citizenship is also a key part of the work of my Department in this context.  To this end, my Department also provides annual funding of the order of €3.4 million to support the work of 22 volunteer centres operating at county level.  In 2010, the number of centres funded increased to 22.  The Department provides core funding to both Volunteer Centres Ireland and Volunteering Ireland, both of which promote volunteering nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">The role of the sector is widely acknowledged in other areas in my Department, most especially in the ongoing implementation of the national drugs strategy.  Under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, formal protocols are in place to ensure the active participation of the community and voluntary sectors in the work of the Drugs Advisory Group which advises me, as the Minister of State responsible, on operational and policy matters relating to the national drugs strategy.  This funding provides for the continued input, expertise and participation of these sectors under the structures applying in delivering on the national drugs strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">In addition, my Department provides annual funding to assist Citywide Drugs Crisis Campaign support and promote the participation of communities most affected by drugs misuse and is used to facilitate the involvement of communities in the structures and the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  Furthermore, as an additional support to communities affected by drugs misuse, annual funding is provided by my Department to the Family Support Network.  This funding helps to improve the situation of families coping with drug misuse and to raise public awareness about the associated problems for families and communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">As the Deputy will be aware, community and voluntary organisations play a significant role in delivering community based drugs initiatives in the 24 drugs task force areas from dedicated funding from my Department.  Funding of the order of €36 million is being provided through the Department in 2010 to support the broad range of drugs measures under the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">It is my intention, through the various arrangements, to continue to support the sectors to the greatest extent possible within the limits of the resources available to me in 2011.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the local and community development programme which supersedes the local development social inclusion and community development programmes.  A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessors is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">A national model involving full integration of community development projects with local development companies has been set out by my Department.  However, it was made clear from the start of the process that other options could be considered and I have approved a number of alternative models in recent weeks.  Ongoing funding for the programme in 2011 and beyond will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates process and will be routed through the local development companies in support of the following four goals of the LCDP: to promote awareness, knowledge and uptake of a wide range of statutory, voluntary and community services; to increase access to formal and informal educational, recreational and cultural development activities and resources; to increase people's work readiness and employment prospects; and to promote engagement with policy, practice and decision making processes on matters affecting local communities.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</from>
            <p eId="para_796">This is a detailed reply to the Deputy, if I could finish it.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">In the context of the current economic climate, my primary concern will continue to be the protection of front-line services delivering vital programmes and initiatives, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities, whether they are urban or rural.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">The Deputy will appreciate that ongoing funding for my Department's programmes for next year, and beyond, will fall to be considered in the context of the upcoming annual Estimates process.  He will also appreciate, however, that no area is immune to cost-cutting measures in the current economic environment.  Regrettably, this may mean that reduced budget allocations may have to be made to certain measures and programmes next year.  I am acutely aware of the concerns of community and voluntary groups in this regard and that is why I have responded to those concerns by placing such emphasis on the protection and prioritisation of front-line services and support to customers and beneficiaries over administration, overhead and ancillary costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">On the provision of supports to the sector, the Deputy can be assured of the Government's commitment to the development of our communities and our belief that the whole area of community development is central to the social and economic well-being of our nation.  Unfortunately, in light of the current economic climate, the sector, like all sectors of the Irish economy, has had to rationalise where possible and operate within reduced budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">Across Government as a whole, we are taking a number of difficult decisions but our approach is to do this in as balanced a way as possible.  Ensuring a continued positive impact across the community and voluntary sector will be a key part of my Department's work in the coming years.</p>

            <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_805">I am currently considering the draft National Sports Facilities Strategy 2010-2015 which has been completed within my Department.  Prior to finalisation, the draft strategy was circulated for comments to relevant Government Departments and other bodies and has been amended to take into account the comments received.  A decision on the publication of the strategy will be taken when I have fully considered the issues contained in it.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level and to ensure a co-ordinated approach across the various agencies and Government Departments involved in supporting the provision of sport and recreational facilities.  The strategy identifies the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and ensure continue impact in the relevant areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Since 1998 grants to the value of €730m have been allocated under the Sports Capital Programme to some 7,400 projects.  A number of changes were introduced for the 2008 Sports Capital Programme to implement key commitments contained in the Agreed Programme for Government.  For example:</p>
            <p eId="para_807">The level of own funding required from applicants in urban disadvantaged areas was reduced;</p>
            <p eId="para_808">Joint applications from schools and clubs were promoted, provided they were accompanied by evidence that the club will have access to the facilities for at least 30 hours a week; and</p>
            <p eId="para_809">In keeping with the Government's commitment to the electronic delivery of public services, the closing date for receipt of online applications was a week later than for paper applications.  This resulted in an increase of 600% in online applications in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Once the Sports Facilities Strategy has been completed, it will provide an improved policy platform for any future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_812">The National Archives has now completed the digitisation of the 1911 and 1901 Census. The mammoth project involved digitising the census returns for those years and background material and making it searchable on-line by all of the available data fields, such as name, address, occupation, religion, relationship to head of household, etc.  The project has been developed in several phases — the 1911 returns for the 32 counties were digitised first — followed by the 1901 returns. All of these records are now available online and 173,704 unique visitors logged on to the site in September 2010. This brought the total number of unique visitors to this site, to the end of September, to over 9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">The 1911 Census records have also being placed on the Europeana website which links to over 6 million digital items in</p>

            <p eId="para_819">My Department hosts the website www.irishgenealogy.ie   which contains a searchable database of Church records of Baptism, Marriage and Burial from Dublin City and Counties Carlow, Cork and Kerry.  The website is an important aid to family history and genealogical research and will be an attraction for the Irish Diaspora to visit Ireland in search of their roots. Since its launch in Nov. 2009 a total of 239,068 Unique Visitors have visited the Church records site with a total of 34,707,315 hits recorded.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">On Wednesday 16th June 2010 I had the pleasure of launching further Church records on this site along with His Grace, Dr. John R.W. Neill, Archbishop of Dublin in St. Werburgh's Church, Dublin.  These additional records were made up of Church of Ireland records for Dublin City, Counties Carlow and Kerry and Roman Catholic Records for the County and City of Cork.  The website www.irishgenealogy.ie   now contains over 2 million records.  Work is currently ongoing to add up to a further 1 million Church Baptism, Marriage and Burial records from Dublin City and County Cork and this work should be substantially completed by end 2010 and will then be added to this website early in 2011.  This project is being undertaken with the support of our National repositories, the National Archives and the National Library of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">The majority of the records also have the corresponding image of the original entry in the Baptism, Marriage or Burial register available to view.  Images for all the records will be made available during 2011.

         the progress that has been made on implementing the recommendations of the tourism renewal group report since the inaugural meeting of the implementation group on 6 September 2010; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_823">Since the publication of the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group in October 2009, my Department has been driving progress on key measures in line with those in the Framework for Action<b>, </b>focusing initially on the Survival Actions, in conjunction with the tourism agencies and other relevant Departments and bodies.   For example, building on the Renewal Group’s Framework for Action along with the Government’s wider strategy for economic renewal, Budget 2010 recognised the tourism sector as a critical, labour-intensive sector and provided for a 3% increase to over €153 million in the overall tourism services budget.  This included maintaining the real level of investment in overseas marketing, as well as a significantly increased capital allocation for tourism product.  The tourism sector was also included in several cross-cutting measures to support enterprises and jobs, including the Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Credit Review System.  </p>
            <p eId="para_824">I established the new Tourism Renewal Implementation Group in July 2010 to oversee and further drive actions on measures, based on the wide-ranging Framework for Action, that support tourism in Ireland, increase competitiveness and ensure that the sector is ready for recovery and growth.  The Group has already met twice under my Chairmanship on 6 and 20 September, and is scheduled to meet again on 27 October.  Its first Progress Report, summarising progress on measures under the Framework for Action has been published on the homepage of my Department's website — http://www.tcs.gov.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">With regard to progress on implementing the recommended Survival Actions, the Tourism Renewal Implementation Group reports that we have either implemented or are making good progress on four of the five survival actions recommended by the Renewal Group.  The sole exception relates to the recommended abolition of the Air Travel Tax, which has to be considered within the context of the overall fiscal framework.  As regards the Recovery Actions, the Group notes good initial progress against each of these nine actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Having regard to the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group, the progress made to date on its recommended Framework for Action and the most urgent challenges facing the Irish tourism industry, the Implementation Group has now identified the following as the priority issues to be pursued in relation to public policy:</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The restoration of sustainable levels of business lending, in particular to ensure availability of working capital for viable tourism enterprises given the seasonal nature of the business;</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Measures to restore and enhance access to overseas markets, in particular to redress the adverse impact of the Air Travel Tax on carrier services;</p>
            <p eId="para_829">Continued investment in overseas marketing and</p>
            <p eId="para_830">Measures to address and reduce enterprise costs, including local authority rates and charges, energy and utility costs and the cost of labour.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">The Implementation Group has also discussed the possibility of holding bilateral meetings with those organisations identified as having a key role under the various actions recommended, in order to review and ensure progress. In the coming months, we will be meeting representatives from the Office of Public Works, given the central importance of the OPW as manager of some of our most significant heritage sites, and with representatives from the City and County Managers' Association, given the key role of local authorities across a range of areas impacting on tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">In line with the Tourism Renewal Group's Framework for Action, the Government, my Department and the tourism agencies are working extremely hard to assist the sector, to maximise business for Irish tourism and to ensure that the tourism agenda is in all relevant policies.  It is my strong belief that, drawing on the experience of members from both the public and private sector, with knowledge and expertise in tourism, transport, tour operation and accommodation, the Tourism Renewal Implementation Group will continue to oversee and drive further action on measures to support the competitiveness and sustainability of tourism in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">I am acutely aware of the potential, impact and importance of the culture sector, in its widest sense, as an economic driver. Culture represents an essential element of our identity, profile, confidence and place in the world.  As I have stated before, on assuming this portfolio, my general policy on the arts, culture and the creative industries is to promote and strengthen them, and increase participation. I want to do this for the sake of culture itself and also for the purposes of strengthening those sectors for the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">In the year since the Farmleigh Global Forum took place, there has been a recognition of the central role that Ireland's artistic and cultural strengths play in building our reputation globally, and on the benefits that flow for Irish trade and investment.  The arts, cultural and creative industries have welcomed and engaged very actively in this discussion, with a view to building on this renewed strategic priority and unlocking the full potential of the key connection between culture, creativity, competitiveness and Ireland's international reputation.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">Many recent international studies have shown that the cultural and creative industries are highly innovative sectors of great potential and are, for instance, one of Europe's most dynamic sectors, contributing approximately 2.5 per cent to EU GDP, with a high growth potential and providing quality jobs to some 5 million people across the EU.  Furthermore, arts, culture and audio-visual content play a crucial role in the deployment of the knowledge society, fuelling investments in broadband infrastructures and services, in digital technologies, as well as in new consumer electronics, communications devices, platforms and channels to market.  They are undoubtedly catalysts of economic and social innovation in many other sectors, as well as differentiators of us as a people, a culture and a nation set apart.  In Ireland these sectors are real and enduring employers rooted in communities, making a real economic, social and cultural contribution.</p>

            <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_843">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 24, 42, 188, 189 and 195 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">It is the policy of the Government to develop and support the tourist industry in partnership with those bodies, such as the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, that represent tourism businesses.  Despite the difficulties in our public finances the Government increased the tourism services budget in 2010 by providing over €153m — an increase of 3% over the 2009 outturn.  The Government has also set out significant plans to fund the further development of our tourism product offering.  In addition the State tourism agencies are maintaining their marketing drives to attract overseas and domestic tourists to holiday in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">Economic circumstances are making trading conditions difficult for most businesses at present.  These difficult conditions are exacerbated in the hotel sector by an over capacity in supply.  This is proving to be a complex situation to resolve and I believe that, inevitably, it will require a market led solution over time.  The role of the National Asset Management Agency and other banks holding hotel-backed loans will be an important factor in determining the future of the hotel sector.  As I already indicated in reply to earlier questions, I met NAMA on Monday of this week to exchange views on recent developments in the sector, to encourage the agency to take a strategic approach to the management of its hotel-backed loans, to build up their own expertise in the area and to consult with sectoral interests, including the Irish Hotels Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">The principal benefit of the NAMA process is the recognition of losses upfront by the participating institutions and the cleansing of the balance sheets of our banks of their most toxic loans.  Otherwise this lending would remain on the banks' books representing a major source of risk and instability in the years ahead which would prevent the banking system from playing its essential role in providing the finance required to underpin our economic recovery and fiscal sustainability.  The transparency and clarity achieved through NAMA is, I believe, a significant strength in the Government's strategy for the repair and the restoration of the banking system.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">The provision and management of finance to hotels, restaurants and other businesses is complex.  For some time now business interests, along with other representative bodies, have been urging Government to improve access to credit to SMEs.  In order to ensure that applications for credit get a fair hearing, the Government have put in place a credit review system under the direction of Mr John Trethowan to ensure that applications for bank credit by viable businesses (including tourism businesses) are assessed in a reasonable manner by the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">In regard to the actions of banks and receivers in relation to support for unviable borrowers, Section 66(1)(a) of the NAMA Act was included to ensure that applicant institutions continue to service loans in the same manner as a prudent lender.  Where specific instances of institutions participating in NAMA are identified as supporting non-viable hotels in order to keep them open in an imprudent manner, these instances should be referred to the Department of Finance for its attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">I am aware of the difficulties that many hotels and restaurants are facing in meeting the cost of local authority charges and have written to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding these costs. I am informed by that Department that local authorities have taken a number of steps to support local business and employment generally. They have also implemented some reductions in their own cost base with a view to reducing the need to increase charges on businesses, and indeed some local authorities have reduced their rates in recent times with a view to trying to support and stimulate employment in their area. However, many businesses — including those in the tourism industry — are still struggling to meet the cost of local authority charges. Given that the Deputies' parties have a majority on most of the city and county councils, I urge them to do everything in their power to ensure that councillors consider the needs of employers when setting their annual budgets, with a view to supporting jobs for local people.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">In acknowledgment of the difficulties faced by the tourism sector, the Government, through Fáilte Ireland, is investing over €11 million in 2010 in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises nationally. The key elements of Fáilte Ireland's enterprise development supports include:</p>
            <p eId="para_851">A comprehensive €3.6 million Business Support Programme helping businesses to grow their "top line" while also tackling their cost base through a combination of restructuring debt and building greater liquidity into their businesses, as well as permanently re-engineering their business processes;</p>
            <p eId="para_852">A suite of Management and Skills Development training programmes to tourism clients;</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Measures to better develop, manage and promote tourism destinations, including promotion of networks and marketing partnerships with trade groups in destinations;</p>
            <p eId="para_854">Strong e-Business Supports to underpin Fáilte Ireland and industry marketing activities, the delivery of enhanced visitor services and the availability of new online learning tools for industry clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">Tourism Ireland is also continuing its marketing activities in Great Britain, Mainland Europe and North America this Autumn highlighting ease of access, great fares and offers from the industry and showcasing the wonderful holiday experiences available here.  In the US, a seat sale is currently under way in gateway cities promoting Autumn/Winter fares from as low as $199 each way.  Meanwhile, in Europe, over 16 million potential visitors will see the "Ireland — More for Less" promotion on the Ryanair website over the coming months.  Car touring campaigns with the ferry companies are also encouraging visitors to take their own cars to Ireland.  At home, Fáilte Ireland's €4 million home holiday marketing is continuing with the Autumn campaign launched during September.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">With the limited resources available to Government it is not always possible to meet every request for assistance but I believe from my own contacts that the tourist industry generally supports the Government's broad policies for development of the industry.  In recent weeks I have received copies of the pre-Budget submissions from a number of representative bodies to the Minister for Finance.  I will certainly ensure their priorities receive due consideration in the formulation of next years' budget.  As Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, I will continue to engage in regular consultation with the industry so that the support provided by the State tourism agencies and the Department are both relevant and effective.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">The national audit of sports facilities is currently being finalised.  Phase one of the audit focused on national and regional sports facilities and has been completed. Phase two involves the compilation of a list of facilities at local level, which is a more complex undertaking. Phase two commenced in 2008 with the assistance of local authorities in conjunction with an audit of arts facilities and an audit of community facilities which was being undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The returns received from Local Authorities have been collated into a database of over 6,000 records and are currently being cross checked against the Department's Sports Capital Programme records.  The mapping of the records has begun.  The outcome of the audit will assist in identifying gaps in sporting facilities and will therefore provide very valuable information for any future rounds of sports capital funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">A lease for the operation of the National Aquatic Centre, which was constructed by the former Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited (CSID), was agreed in April 2003 between CSID and Dublin WaterWorld Ltd.   As was provided for under the VAT legislation in force at that time, a VAT invoice for €10,254,600 was issued to Dublin WaterWorld Ltd. upon the creation of this lease.  As this payment was not made by Dublin Waterworld Ltd. CSID, at a meeting in September 2003, instructed its legal advisors to proceed to recover the outstanding amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">The non-payment of this VAT invoice was among a number of breaches of the lease subsequently lodged in a Statement of Claim by CSID with the High Court (Commercial Court) in 2005.  The outcome of the substantive proceedings in this matter was the vacating of the Centre by the previous operator and its return to the direct control of the former CSID, now the National Sports Campus Authority (NSCDA).</p>
            <p eId="para_862">The question of the VAT charge on the lease of the National Aquatic Centre was referred by the High Court to Arbitration and following the submission of documents an oral Arbitration was held on 28 June 2005. The Arbitrator found that the amount of VAT charged by CSID on the capitalised value of the lease to DWW was correctly charged.  The matter was returned to the High Court which upheld the Arbitrator's award.  The defendant — Dublin WaterWorld Ltd. — appealed this judgment to the Supreme Court.  The matter came before the Supreme Court in November 2009, and the findings of the Court were issued on 30th April last.  In a further hearing on 11th May, the Supreme Court ordered the award of the arbitration be set aside and that the matter be referred back to an independent Arbitrator for further consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">The Court also made an award of costs in respect of the High Court and Supreme Court proceedings in favour of the defendant/appellant — Dublin WaterWorld Ltd.  The level of such costs is yet to be determined and may in time be decided upon by the Taxing Master.  Following the issuance of the Supreme Court decision, the National Sports Campus Development Authority considered the matter in detail and sought the advice of its legal and tax advisers on the implications of this ruling.  The Authority has since decided that it would be prudent and in the best interests of the Authority not to proceed any further with the Arbitration process.  The Authority has conveyed its decision to the legal representatives of Dublin WaterWorld Limited.</p>

            <p eId="para_869">Promotion of particular regions as tourist destinations is a matter for the relevant tourism agencies. The work is primarily undertaken by Tourism Ireland in respect of overseas promotion and Fáilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in respect of domestic promotion.  In terms of meetings between Government Ministers from the North and South, these meetings take place on a bilateral basis to discuss particular issues, more broadly in the format of a North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Plenary meeting or, where the sector is identified as a formal area of North South cooperation, a NSMC Sectoral meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">With regard to my areas of responsibility, as the Deputy will be aware, tourism was specifically identified in the Good Friday Agreement as one of the key areas for North/South cooperation, and consequently it is one of the sectors on which the North/South Ministerial Council meets in Sectoral format.   The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of tourism.  It also takes decisions on policies and actions to be implemented by Tourism Ireland Limited, a publicly owned limited company established to promote the island of Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">In terms of meetings between the respective Ministers with responsibility for tourism, there have been a total of ten North/South Ministerial Council meetings in Tourism Sectoral format. The most recent one took place on the 16th June last in Armagh when I met with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, Ms Arlene Foster MLA.  Among the items discussed at this meeting were the challenging environment for tourism globally and Tourism Ireland's Business Plan for 2010, including its plans to focus on best prospect markets and spread the value message in tactical marketing campaigns. The next such meeting will take place in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">On the sports side, I also had a meeting with my Northern Ireland counterpart, the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Nelson McCausland MLA, at the opening of the Aviva Stadium in May where we discussed a number of sporting issues of mutual interest.  Finally, I also attended the tenth Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council at Farmleigh House on 5th July last.  Minister Arlene Foster, MLA and Minister Nelson McCausland, MLA also attended this meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_877">Under the Sports Capital Programme, funding is allocated to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Given the current budgetary situation and the high level of outstanding commitments it was considered prudent to pause prior to announcing the next round of the Programme and accordingly no date has been set for the next round of the Programme.  In the interim, the Department has been managing the drawdown of funds allocated under earlier rounds of the programme, and there is obviously no question of rowing back on allocations already made.  The current position remains that €48 million has been provided in the Department's vote in the 2010 Estimates to cover payments to be made from the C1 subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Around 1,000 payments will be made to projects being undertaken this year across the country.  These projects will allow clubs to drain pitches, erect floodlighting, build changing rooms and sports halls and generally increase the opportunities for people to engage in sports at all levels.  The Deputy will be aware that since 1998, €730m has been allocated 7,400 projects nationwide which has transformed the level of sports facilities throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_882">As I have explained in response to a similar question on 29th  September 2010, the position is that the National Archives has the three following travelling exhibitions in store:</p>
            <p eId="para_883">"A Nation and not a Rabble" —  Ireland in the year July 1921-June 1922;</p>
            <p eId="para_884">"The Calamitous Fire" — the destruction of the Public Record Office of Ireland, June 1922;</p>
            <p eId="para_885">"Lovers of Liberty?"  —  100 years of Local Government in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">These were prepared and exhibited extensively in the late 1990s, and have been exhibited more occasionally since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">In recent years the limited resources available to the National Archives for outreach have been concentrated mainly on the development of its website and the digital publication of the 1901 and 1911 Census Returns.  In addition to the Census Returns themselves, the website includes extensive contextual material, describing life in early 20th century Ireland, supported by many photographs illustrating life at the time.  The inclusion of the contextual material is particularly helpful to teachers using this resource in the classroom, and the website is proving very popular in secondary school history classes. The resources available to the National Archives preclude an expansion of its outreach service for the present.</p>

            <p eId="para_889">Culture Night 2010 took place on the 24th of September last in 20 locations throughout the country, with some 500 cultural venues remaining open until late in the evening to provide the public with free access to the various collections, workshops and other events.  Culture Night has grown from a relatively small scale cultural event staged only in Dublin in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is, attracting over 200,000 visitors in 2009 and even greater attendance figures are expected from the 2010 event.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">Temple Bar Cultural Trust co-ordinates the Dublin Culture Night event in association with the Council of National Cultural Institutions, Temple Bar Cultural Quarter, Dublin City Council, art and cultural institutions and other agencies.  My Department has provided funding to the Trust for the event since 2006 and in 2008, requested the Trust to consider an expansion of the Culture Night model to cities and towns outside of Dublin.  The success of this matched funding initiative in 2008 led to my Department agreeing to fund further expansions in 2009 and 2010.  This year's was the most extensive Culture Night to date, with locations from Cork to Donegal and Galway to Wexford participating, including Gaeltacht regions for the first time ever.  In addition, the Dublin event included a specific programme of events, celebrating the designation of Dublin as UNESCO City of Literature.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">Discussions are ongoing as to the most appropriate way to build on the success and popularity of Culture Night. You will appreciate that these discussions must have regard to the resources available to my Department and to the many competing demands on these resources.  St. Patrick's Festival, also part-funded by Fáilte Ireland through my Department's allocation, is, of course, the primary cultural festival during the Spring.  There is a clear logic to the St. Patrick's Festival and Culture Night activities being currently positioned at the beginning and end of our main tourism season.</p>

            <p eId="para_895">The current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, operated by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport provides grant aid to a maximum of €3.8m to Local Authorities, towards the capital cost of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the project must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority.  Under the current programme which closed for applications in 2000, 46 pools have been opened throughout the country with a further 11 pools at various stages of development.  The total expenditure of €144.9m under the Programme from 2000 to date has leveraged a total investment of some €406m in swimming pools throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The allocation of €7.5m in 2010 will be sufficient to meet commitments arising in 2010 under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool programme.  No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the Programme.  The question of funding a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme will be considered in the Annual Estimates for 2011 and beyond, which are currently underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_907">I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 43 and 192 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">I have acknowledged on many occasions that we are currently in a very challenging period for Irish tourism. Figures for the first six months of the year show that although we welcomed over 2.6 million overseas visitors, this represented a reduction of 20.5% on the corresponding 2009 levels.  Last year, when Tourism Ireland finalised its Business Plan for 2010, it set the ambitious target of growing visitor numbers by 3% against the background of a forecast decline in numbers.  Clearly the target for visitor numbers will not now be met. While this is disappointing, it must be viewed in context.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Tourism worldwide has been deeply affected by global economic difficulties and loss of consumer confidence.  Furthermore, the exceptional weather conditions in the early part of the year and the closure of airports in April and May due to the volcanic ash cloud meant that it was inevitable that a fall off in the numbers of people travelling, particularly in North west Europe, would be experienced in the first half of 2010. On the positive side, it should be noted that the latest published monthly figures for June 2010, show a monthly fall of 5.7 % compared to June 2009 which is significantly less than the year-on-year fall witnessed for the earlier months of 2010. Furthermore, the number of visitors from North America and other long haul destinations actually increased in June 2010 compared to June 2009 by 1.4% and 4.1% respectively. Visitors from these markets are particularly important for the tourism sector as they tend to stay longer and spend more than visitors from our nearer markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">With regard to future targets, <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy — a Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, </i>launched on the 28th  September last, sets a target of increasing visitor numbers to 8 million by 2015.  The Strategy provides for 15,000 new jobs to be generated directly in the tourism sector by this growth in numbers.   In terms of achieving these targets, the Report recognises that in the short to medium term, Ireland’s best prospects from a tourism perspective are in the United States, Great Britain and the major European markets like Germany, France, Italy and Spain. In the longer term it highlights the Asia-Pacific region as one of the fastest growing outbound tourism markets and in this regard China and India will be the highest priorities for Ireland. Tourism Ireland was represented on the High Level Group which drafted the new Strategy and it is envisaged will also be represented on the new Foreign Trade Council which is being established for the purpose of monitoring, reviewing and promoting implementation of the agreed targets as set out in the Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">In terms of expectations for 2011, Tourism Ireland is finalising its Business Plan for next year at present, for subsequent approval by the North/South Ministerial Council.  I understand that, drawing on the overall strategic objectives set out in Government policy, it will contain targets for returning to growth next year from all our significant overseas markets.  Activity being planned by Tourism Ireland includes leveraging the strength of St Patrick's Day, targeting the Irish diaspora abroad and emphasising the great value on offer in Ireland for visitors.  New infrastructure, such as the recently opened Convention Centre Dublin, will also be used to promote Ireland overseas as a professional conference and business tourism destination. Events such as the Solheim Cup at Killeen Castle in 2011, the start of the Tall Ships Race Series which will be hosted by Waterford in 2011, the UEFA Cup Final at the Aviva Stadium in 2011, Irish Craft Year 2011 and the Volvo Ocean Race which returns to Galway in 2012, can be used to attract significant publicity around the world. They will provide valuable opportunities to place Ireland in the international spotlight and showcase the many attractions that we have to offer as a holiday destination.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland will continue its significant investment in tourism product and services and will also continue to support local festivals and events. These, together with Fáilte's highly successful "holiday at home" marketing campaign, are playing a key role in boosting tourist revenues around the country as well as boosting employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">In summary, while we have certainly gone through a difficult recent period for Irish tourism, I believe that the Government is pursuing the right programmes and measures to support the continued development of tourism.  We are working with the industry and the tourism agencies in order to position the tourism sector for recovery and growth as part of the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal. I am confident that the necessary supports are in place to ensure that the ambitious targets previously outlined will be achieved in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_920">To manage, operate and maintain the sports campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">To encourage and promote the use of the sports campus by professional and amateur sports people and members of the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The Government is advancing the development of new national sports facilities at Abbotstown as resources permit. The availability of funding for this project is therefore being considered in the context of the budgetary process for 2011 and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">In parallel to the core National Sports Campus project, the National Sports Campus Development Authority is also continuing its strategy of redeveloping and refurbishing the existing buildings on the Abbotstown site for use by the wider sporting community, in particular the National Governing Bodies of Sport.  It is intended that those buildings which can be cost effectively refurbished for new uses and which do not constrain the Master Plan for the Campus facilities will be retained.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The first such building was the former State Laboratory, which was refurbished as a new headquarters for the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).  Work was completed in November 2007 within budget and the FAI took occupancy shortly afterwards.  The second strand of this strategy was the refurbishment of the former Central Meat Control Laboratory as a new headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport. Construction work on the project commenced in December 2008 and was completed at the end of August 2009. The Institute has since taken up occupation of their new headquarters.  The Authority itself also relocated its offices to the refurbished Institute building.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">The next strand of this strategy, the renovation of the former Marine Institute building to provide on-Campus office accommodation for other sporting bodies, is currently underway.  The Authority, together with the Irish Sports Council and the Office of Public Works, are continuing work on finalisation of the detailed plans for this new facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">The Authority — through its wholly owned subsidiary, NSCDA (Operations) Limited — is also responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of the National Aquatic Centre.  Based on Fáilte Ireland statistics for 2008, the Centre was the fourth most popular paying visitor attraction in the State with some 707,000 visits.  During 2009, the number of visitors to the Centre increased to 723,000.  In 2009, Swim Ireland established a new High Performance Centre at the National Aquatic Centre. This has seen Swim Ireland base their High Performance Coach at the Centre and reconfirms the Centre as the country's foremost aquatics facility.  Throughout 2009, some 31 new national swimming records were set at the Centre.  In addition, the Centre has achieved numerous leisure industry awards.  Over the course of the past two years, the Authority have been actively promoting the Centre as an ideal training base for international teams in the run up to the London 2012 Olympic Games.  I am delighted to report that on foot of this activity the USA Synchronized Swimming team has chosen the National Aquatic Centre as its training base for the 2012 Olympics.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">Since May of this year, the Authority (again through its subsidiary) has taken over responsibility for the day-to-day operation of Morton Stadium, Santry — our national athletics stadium.  As with the National Aquatic Centre, the Authority are continuing to promote Morton Stadium as an ideal pre-Olympic training base — particularly given the recent installation of a Mondo running track, identical to that which will be installed in the London Olympic stadium.</p>

The funding required to support these activities is met from the annual grant in aid provided to the Irish Sports Council which in 2010 amounts to €49.572m.

            <p eId="para_934">A high-level coordinating group, chaired by my Department, is identifying at the opportunities that may arise for Ireland, across the sports, tourism and cultural sectors, from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The group comprises representatives from Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Irish Sports Council, the Olympic Council of Ireland, Paralympic Council of Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The discussions of the group are taking into account the current economic situation and the findings of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force Report which was published last year.  The Task Force report made a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">Given our proximity to London and the many accessible routes to and from the United Kingdom, we can benefit from a sporting, tourism and culture perspective.  The hosting in Ireland of Olympic and Paralympic teams for training purposes leading up to the Games has potential, while the economic benefits of securing additional tourists to Ireland before, during and after the Games are significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">In terms of the tourism potential of the event, a number of specific initiatives are being undertaken by the Tourism Agencies to seek to maximise the potential benefits to Irish tourism of having the Olympics in London. These measures include:</p>
            <p eId="para_937">Working with the official tour operators responsible for co-ordinating the travel arrangements for athletes participating in the Games to ensure that Ireland is included as a destination for pre and post-Olympics packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">Arranging pre and post-Olympics familiarisation visits for key media contacts who are attending the London Olympics. These visits will showcase the sports facilities and cultural product on offer throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">Targeting tourists from London who may wish to get away from the city when the games are in progress, by offering good value offers and packages linked to other events in Ireland and presenting Ireland as a place to escape to and relax.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Since there will be reduced accommodation and carrier capacity available for visitors who wish to travel to London when the Olympics are on, Tourism Ireland will also be working with UK inbound tour operators to offer alternatives which would fill any gaps in their normal programmes, thereby diverting business to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Fáilte Ireland supported University College Dublin in their launch as a potential Olympic Training camp venue and also supported the European Triathlon Championships this year in Athlone.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The Tourism agencies are also working with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia, as well as their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, VisitLondon and VisitBritain, to identify other opportunities to maximise the tourism potential of the London Olympics for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">One of the issues that the London 2012 coordinating group is looking at is Ireland's potential to attract international teams and athletes for training camps in the lead up to London 2012.  The Deputy may be aware that the American Olympic Synchronized Swimming Squad has chosen the National Aquatic Centre as its pre-Olympic Training Base for the London Games.  The squad of over 20 swimmers and team officials will be based in Dublin for three separate periods and will be joined in Ireland by family members and friends at various stages during their stays.  My Department is also producing a CD which will contain the details of a number of Irish elite sports facilities which are suitable as pre-London training camps.  This CD will be promoted through the network of National Olympic/Paralympic Committees and the Irish Embassies abroad in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">The Arts Council and Culture Ireland are developing proposals for a cultural programme which would include participation in the Cultural Olympiad of Irish culture groups and the organisation of a cultural programme in Ireland targeted at those of Irish descent living in the UK.  These are some of the practical areas of work that are underway. The high-level coordinating group will continue to meet on an ongoing basis over the next two years to maximise opportunities from the London 2012 Games.</p>

            <p eId="para_948">It is my belief that the arts are critical to the well-being of society, enhancing the life of local communities, and giving artistic expression to place and identity.  Much work has been done to develop the arts at a local level, not necessarily based on the Local Sports Partnership (LSP) model, which is a specific model of practice.  The LSP concept was developed under the remit of the Irish Sports Council (ISC) in 2000 as a means to coordinate and promote the development of sport.  The majority of the LSPs operate under the aegis of the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">The Arts Council, has worked strategically with local authorities for 25 years in developing the arts at local level.  This model focuses more on embedding arts expertise at the heart of the local authority service.  Each of the 34 local authorities in Ireland employs a full-time Arts Officer.  In many instances local authorities lead in providing a broader Arts Service, employing several specialist arts staff in addition to the Arts Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">In November a conference will be held to mark 25 years of Arts Council and Local Authority partnership.  Senior contributors from Ireland, the UK and Australia will explore the role of the arts and culture in local development at the conference.</p>

            <p eId="para_1023">In July 2008 Notifications of Intention to apply for recognition for two new primary schools in the Tallaght/Firhouse and Saggart/Rathcoole/Newcastle areas were received by my Department from the patron body referred to by the Deputy.  A review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools is currently being carried out under the Commission on School Accommodation. In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.  The Commission is due to report to me shortly at which time I will have to consider the policy matters and necessary arrangements and revised procedures that will need to be put in place. The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. The study indicated that the requirement for additional primary provision in the short to medium term is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. The Tallaght/Firhouse/Oldbawn area was included in these initial identified areas, whereas Newcastle/Rathcoole/Saggart was not. The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected enrolments at primary level increase from the current total enrolment of circa 505,600 pupils to an expected enrolment of circa 563,300 pupils by the year 2016.   It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department will continue to analyse demographic trends to determine the level of additional provision which will be required into the future. Overall school requirements in the area referred to will be considered in this context.</p>

Providers of education have no entitlement to reclaim VAT charged to them on purchases of goods or services used in the provision of their VAT-exempt activity of education.  This includes VAT incurred on the purchase of musical instruments.  It is understood that in the UK musical instruments purchased by schools directly from suppliers are subject to VAT in the normal way.  However, local education authorities (LEAs) in the UK are subject to special right-of-recovery VAT rules in certain circumstances and it may be possible for schools acquiring musical instruments through LEAs to benefit in some instances from VAT recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">I have no plans to introduce special VAT arrangements in relation to musical instruments or equipment purchased by schools.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1032">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on the introduction of vehicle registration tax (VRT) on 1 January 1993, there was a requirement for all vehicles to be presented for examination prior to registration.  However, by the early years of this decade, the Revenue Commissioners had adopted a risk-based approach to the registration of vehicles, thus eliminating the need for all vehicles, save those that posed a serious risk of loss to the Exchequer, to be examined prior to registration.  While this risk-based approach proved satisfactory to protect the VRT yield, it meant that a significant number of the used vehicles entering the State were being registered in the State without prior examination.  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue, as the registration authority for the State, also has a responsibility to ensure that all vehicles presented for registration are registered correctly.  This responsibility became more onerous with the transposition into Irish law in March 2009 of EU Directive 2007/46/EC, which laid down minimum European vehicle standards as a pre-condition for registration.  While the Directive impacts only on new passenger cars at present, its scope will be extended to all vehicles by 2014.  Additionally, other EU Directives will extend obligations on the registration authorities of all Member States to examine all vehicles prior to registration.  In addition to the EU vehicle inspection requirements mentioned above, concerns were raised by members of the Oireachtas, An Garda Síochána, the Road Safety Authority and indeed the motor trade regarding the provenance and safety of some of the used vehicles presented for registration. To address these concerns, the Government decided to make legislative provision to allow for the appointment of a competent person to carry out a pre-registration examination on all vehicles presented for registration.  The intention of the relevant law was to ensure that all the conditions necessary for the registration of a vehicle and the proper administration of VRT are complied with before a vehicle may be registered in the State. Thus, section 131 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended by section 104 of the Finance Act 2010) provided for the appointment of a "<i>competent person”</i>   to carry out certain functions relating to the registration of vehicles in the State on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, while section 109 of the Finance Act 2010 provided for the authorisation of such competent person in respect of the collection and payment of the tax to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">The requirement to have all used vehicles presented for pre-registration examination has presented some new challenges for both Revenue and the competent person appointed to carry out these functions, namely, the NCTS.  In consultation with other stakeholders, e.g. the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), the Farm Tractor &amp; Machinery Trade Association Ltd (FTMTA), Revenue and the NCTS are facing these challenges and have implemented some revised procedures to speed up the registration process.  For example, the NCTS have recently put procedures in place to provide additional capacity in their centres, including extending the opening times in some centres and the configuration of two additional centres for registration purposes in order to address current delays.  Revenue are examining the possibility of providing electronic facilities for the registration of used vehicles that have been subjected to a pre registration examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">Revenue is confident that with the implementation of these and other similar initiatives, an efficient user-friendly service will be available to all persons requiring vehicle registration, notwithstanding the fact that the vehicle will, in all cases as provided for in legislation, have to be presented for examination prior to registration.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1036">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have in place an extensive database of vehicle valuations.  From this database, they have built an on-line calculator where members of the public can, through the Internet, calculate the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) that is payable on a range of vehicle makes and models depending on the characteristics, i.e. age, mileage and condition of each individual vehicle within that make and model range.  This database has been set up based on valuations provided by Revenue for vehicles previously presented for registration and is updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in vehicle values in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">Because of the uniqueness of many motor caravans (or camper vans), with some built on a once-off basis, Revenue's database does not contain valuation details for every motor caravan available on the market abroad, but only for those models previously valued when presented for registration.  It is not always possible, therefore, to get a valuation from Revenue's valuation system for a particular motor caravan that an individual may be interested in purchasing.  It should be noted that the same situation prevails for passenger cars, in that many vehicles on sale in the UK and elsewhere are not already on Revenue's database because the models in question may not be generally available in the Irish market or have not been previously presented for registration and have not, therefore, been valued by Revenue's valuation officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">Regarding the valuation of a particular vehicle, VRT is assessed on the open market selling price (OMSP) of a vehicle in the State.  The OMSP is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 as the price inclusive of all taxes and duties which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the vehicle might reasonably fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.  Any person who has paid or is liable to pay VRT may appeal to the Revenue Commissioners against the amount of tax charged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">Section 130 of the Finance Act 1992 provides the definition of a motor caravan for VRT purposes.  Motor caravans with an unladen weight of not more than 3,000 kilograms are classified as category B — attracting a VRT rate of 13.3% of their OMSP in the State.  Motor caravans with an unladen weight in excess of 3,000 kilograms are classified as category C attracting a flat rate of VRT of €50.  Vehicles with an unladen weight of not more than 3,000 kilograms with many of the characteristics of a motor caravan, but which fail to meet the motor caravan legal definition, are classified as passenger vehicles (category A) attracting a rate of VRT of between 14% and 36% of OMSP depending on the vehicle's level of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">For this reason, in order to determine their category for tax purposes, many motor caravans must be weighed before they can be valued because it is not possible for Revenue's valuation officers to assess the VRT due until it has been established to which category the vehicle belongs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">The valuation of vehicles can be a complex activity involving many variables including the identification and classification of the vehicle for VRT purposes, the identification of the exact make, model, version and variant, the identification of the individual characteristics of the vehicle such as the age, condition and mileage and for many vehicles, particularly prestige, rebuilt and once-off vehicles, each vehicle must be valued individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">The Deputy may wish to note that the Commissioners have made the valuation process undertaken by their staff as transparent as possible by publishing on their web site <i>www.revenue.ie </i>1their internal valuation manual.  This manual contains the set of instructions issued to valuation officers detailing the procedures that must be followed in valuing a vehicle.  These instructions are freely accessible to members of the public who wish to know the process by which Revenue officials form an opinion as to the value of a vehicle.</p>

The Civil Service Worksharing scheme was introduced in all Departments with effect from 1 June 2001.  All civil servants, whether established or unestablished, may apply to workshare.  The implementation of the Worksharing scheme within Departments is at the discretion of management in light of the needs of the Department and management within each Department has the final decision on applications for participation in the scheme. Whereas Departments are encouraged to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate requests from staff to participate in the scheme, the operation of the scheme is subject to the principle that the operating requirements of Departments are not adversely affected.  In addition, all applications to participate in the scheme are considered in the context of the organisational needs of Departments and such organisational needs may make it necessary to limit the number who may participate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">In the subscription agreement, AIB and Bank of Ireland were tasked with making available 10% additional capacity for SME lending in 2009.  The recapitalised banks stated that there were no constraints on lending to viable businesses.  However, the 10% target did not result in the expected level of additional lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">Thus, in the context of NAMA at the end of March, both AIB and Bank of Ireland produced credible lending plans for how they will lend €3bn per annum (covering the period April to April) to SMEs.  I also established the Credit Review Office to ensure that AIB and Bank of Ireland would lend to viable businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">Mr. Trethowan has recently reported to the Department that both AIB and Bank of Ireland remain open for business and I would strongly encourage borrowers to use the Credit Review Office if they find this is not so.</p>

No. 127 if 2010 with the intention of encouraging and increasing the supply of credit to viable borrowers (that is, borrowers who have the capacity to service their loans) for business purposes.  One of the ways that it does this is by reviewing decisions of banks to refuse credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">In his appearance before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on 21 September, Mr Trethowan informed the Committee that "Approximately 20 applications have been sent to the office for review, of which we have dealt with about ten, of which five have been upheld."</p>

            <p eId="para_1273">I assume what the Deputy had in mind in his question refers primarily to the various area and sectoral property based tax incentive schemes provided for in the tax code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">There are only 2 such schemes still remaining; relief for Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units (subject to a Commencement Order) and the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Scheme. Tax relief in respect of investment in Convalescent Homes, Qualifying (Private) Hospitals, Qualifying Mental Health Centres, Registered Nursing Homes and Qualifying (Nursing Home) Residential Units was abolished in the Supplementary Budget and Finance Bill 2009. Tax relief in respect of investment in buildings used for childcare purposes was terminated in the Finance Bill 2010. Apart from these schemes, all other property based tax incentive schemes have been terminated on, or before, 31 July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available on the cost to the Exchequer of each of the property based tax reliefs is based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers and corporation tax returns filed by companies for the years 2004 to 2008, the latest year for which this information is available. These are set out in the following table. The figures are composite costs for both commercial and residential property reliefs.</p>

Accordingly, the specific information on costs for 2003 and earlier years are not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">I should also point out that the provisions of section 23 Finance Act 2010 severely curtails the amount of tax reliefs that can be used to reduce the income tax liability of those on high incomes. These provisions ensure that, in addition to the income levy, those with high incomes and using reliefs will have an effective income tax rate of about 30%. This measure applies to a list of specified reliefs, including most of the area and sectoral based property incentive schemes, the use of all of which has been curtailed as a result of this change.</p>

            <p eId="para_1426">The rent-a-room scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 as an incentive to encourage individuals to let rooms in their sole or main residence. The property must be situated in the State and be occupied by the individual as his/her sole or main residence during the tax year for which the relief is claimed. Payments received under the scheme in respect of the letting of rooms and any incidental services, e.g. meals, laundry etc., are exempt from income tax, PRSI, health contributions and the income levy where the amounts received do not exceed the annual threshold, currently €10,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The gross payments are taken into account in establishing whether the annual threshold is exceeded, i.e. no deduction is allowed for expenses incurred in connection with the letting. Where the gross payments exceed the threshold in a particular year, the entire profits are taxable and not just the amount that exceeds the threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">The availability of mortgage interest relief, the capital gains tax exemption on gains arising from the disposal of an individual's principal private residence and the owner-occupier relief for property situated in a tax incentive area, such as an urban renewal scheme, are not affected by the receipt of income that is exempt from income tax under the rent-a-room scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">The relief does not apply where the letting is by a parent to a child or, for example, where it is between an employer and an employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">I am informed by the Commissioners that the let room or rooms can comprise a self-contained unit within the residence, such as a basement flat or a converted garage attached to the residence. However, a self-contained unit that is adjacent to the residence, but not actually attached to it, cannot qualify for the relief.</p>

         if she will indicate the number of persons aged over 70 years who are estimated to be in excess of the permitted income and capital guidelines for the retention of medical cards; if she will indicate the number of such persons who surrendered their medical card when the letter of request went out to them; if it is expected that income reviews will see further numbers in this age category lose their medical cards; and the number of income reviews in respect of people over the age of 70 that have resulted in the withdrawal of their medical card; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1432">Most recent figures supplied by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department show 343,399 medical card holders aged 70 or over as at 1st September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">When the Government took the decision to remove automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over, it had been estimated that 20,000 persons would lose eligibility to the medical card under this measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">Following the enactment of the Health Act 2008, the HSE wrote to all medical card holders aged 70 or over in January 2009 advising them to complete a return slip if they were over the threshold for a medical card.  Approximately, 12,000 clients responded and their cards were removed from the Executive's medical card register.  In addition, approximately 5,000 medical cards for persons aged 70 or over were removed from the medical card register in 2009 as part of the HSE's medical card data quality exercise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">Any person aged 70 or over who qualifies for a medical card on the basis of their gross income being within the gross income thresholds of €700 per week for a single person and €1,400 for a couple, will continue to retain their medical card, unless their circumstances change to bring their income above the thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">The other information sought by the Deputy is not provided to my Department as a matter of routine.  Accordingly, the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive has been requested to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to this matter.</p>

In the case in question, as a social welfare recipient he would qualify under the scheme for a weekly fee reduction for each child of €100 for a full-time childcare place, €50 for a part-time childcare place and €33 for a sessional (not more than 3 hours 30 minutes) childcare place.  Information regarding childcare services which are participating in the CCS scheme, is available from local City and County Childcare Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">The CETS scheme is being implemented by my Office, on behalf of FÁS and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) under the Department of Education and Science and replaces the previous childcare support schemes implemented by FÁS and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs).  Under the FÁS and VEC schemes, qualifying students and trainees attending certain FÁS and VEC courses could apply for a childcare support payment of up to €63.50 per week towards their childcare costs.  Under the new CETS scheme, participating services are paid a weekly capitation fee of  €170 for each full-time childcare place contracted with their service, with lesser amounts obtaining for half day and afterschool places.  In return, the service is required to provide a childcare place free of charge to the qualifying student or trainee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">I also have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which provides for a free pre-school year to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months in September of the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 are eligible for the free pre-school year which commenced in September 2010.  There is no provision under the scheme to enrol children that are below the qualifying age.</p>

            <p eId="para_1544">Health expenditure in line with public expenditure generally is being addressed in the context of the Government's strategy for economic recovery and its target to reduce the general Government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014. Already this year the Government has made a series of decisions which significantly reduced the Health Estimates by €630m on pay and €394 on non-pay, over €1bn overall.  The Government will continue to take measures to control health expenditure within the context of overall Government policy on public expenditure whilst ensuring that patient safety and quality are at the centre of the delivery of healthcare.  In general the approach taken by the Government has been informed by the recommendations in the Special Group's Report.  However, in addressing particular areas, in some instances different measures have been implemented where these have proved more effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">The recommendations pertaining to the Department and agencies under its aegis, and the Health Service Executive, are set out in the following table.  Full year savings in excess of €625m are detailed.</p>

The amount of treatment the NTPF is allowed to source in this way is limited to 10% of its patient throughput.  For reasons of convenience to patients as well as the additional non-patient-care costs that would arise, the NTPF does not generally purchase services abroad.

The CCS provides for two subvention Bands.  Band B has been raised to the Band A level and Band C (now Band B) has been increased by 11%.  These changes were made possible by restricting parents in receipt of Job Seeker’s Benefit/Allowance to part-time childcare provision (up to 5 hours per day).  Restructuring the subvention Bands in this way has improved the level of provision under the scheme for low income working parents (e.g. parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS) are now categorised as Band A, and Medical Card and GP card holders benefited from the 11% increase to the new Band B).</p>

Approximately 4,300 pre-school services are participating in the ECCE scheme and 63,000 children are availing of the free pre-school year.  In addition, 600 services are in the new CETS scheme and 950 services are participating in the CCS scheme. The existing administrative structures, which supported the original NCIP programme and its broader policy objectives, are now supporting a greatly expanded area of work at no additional cost to the State.  These structures are also supporting the implementation of Síolta (the national early learning framework) to underpin the quality provision of the pre-school year.  In effect, the work of the existing support structures for the NCIP has more than doubled and is being successfully delivered with no additional resources or costs arising.</p>

            <p eId="para_1627">I have introduced a number of measures in the past year to reduce the costs of drugs and medicines for both the State and consumers. These measures have included a reduction in the wholesale and retail mark-ups under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 and new price agreements with IPHA (Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association) and APMI (Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland) which have reduced the price of hundreds of the most commonly prescribed off-patent medicines by 40%. Cumulatively these measures are expected to deliver savings to the State of over €200m in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">I was most concerned to learn that some pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of these price and margin reductions to those patients whose expenditure on drug purchases are not met by the Health Service Executive e.g. persons whose monthly expenditure is below the €120 per month threshold under the Drugs Payment Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">I have raised this matter with the Irish Pharmacy Union. It is disappointing that some pharmacists are withholding the benefit of the lower prices from some of their customers. The public deserve better in these difficult economic times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">The Code of Conduct for Pharmacists issued by the pharmacy regulator (the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland) requires pharmacists, amongst other things, to provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines, health-related products and services provided by them. Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct. Patients have every right to ask a pharmacist the reasons for the price they are being charged and if dissatisfied can, if they so choose, transfer their custom to an alternative pharmacy.</p>

Under section 33 of the Act a breach of this code of conduct by registered pharmacists constitutes professional misconduct.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">Sections 35 and 36 of the Act set out the grounds upon which a complaint can be made against a registered pharmacist and a registered retail pharmacy business respectively.  Under section 36 of the Act, a complaint may be made about a pharmacy on the grounds that the pharmacy owner, an employee or partner of the owner has been convicted of an offence under medicines, pharmacy or controlled drugs legislation or that these persons have been convicted of other offences or committed misconduct of such a nature that if the person were a pharmacist the Council would be likely to refuse to register the person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">Part 6 of the Act sets out the procedures to be followed in relation to a complaint against a registered pharmacist or registered retail pharmacy business.  If it is found that a complaint has been substantiated against a pharmacist or pharmacy, section 48 of the Act sets out the sanctions that may be imposed by the Council of the PSI which include: admonishment or censure, attachment of conditions to the registration of a pharmacist or pharmacy, suspension of a pharmacist's or pharmacy's registration for a period of time, or cancellation of a pharmacist's or pharmacy's registration.  If the Council proposes to attach conditions to, suspend or cancel the registration of a pharmacist or pharmacy, an application must be made to the High Court to confirm the application of these sanctions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1636">Radiation oncology services for Sligo patients were provided by St Luke's Hospital prior to the development of radiation oncology services at Galway University Hospital (GUH) in 2004.

            <p eId="para_1637">It was never the intention that patients previously being seen by the St Luke's consultant at SGH would now be required to travel to Dublin for follow-up; rather, the radiation oncology service at SGH has been taken over by the GUH service in a planned hand-over. Patients continue to have a locally based service with one radiation oncologist at GUH having a specific commitment to Sligo where weekly outpatient clinics are held.</p>

         the number of Irish fishing vessels that are affected by the new health and safety regulations introduced by his Department; the number of vessels that had complied by the deadline of 30 September 2010; the number of vessels which had not complied by the deadline; if he will grant an exemption for inshore boats; if he will extend the State decommissioning scheme to those boat owners who cannot afford the cost of implementing the new regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1646">The development of safety regulations for fishing vessels dates back to the Fishing Vessel Safety Review group, which reported in 1996. One key recommendation made by that group was for the establishment of a safety regime for fishing vessels covering stability, strength, hull and machinery. Following several fishing vessel tragedies in 2007 efforts focused on the development of a scheme for the fishing vessels in the 15 to 24m length category. My Department developed regulations for such vessels based on international standards and these regulations were subject to extensive public consultations, following, which the regulations entered into force in September of that year.    The Department of Transport as the maritime safety regulator does not regulate or control the number of fishing vessels; this function is carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Compliance with the safety regulations is only required for those fishing vessels which wish to operate. Consequently, the Department of Transport only maintains figures for fishing vessels, which have been issued with or made contact with the Department for certificates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">The new regulations apply to fishing vessels in the 15m to 24m length category on a phased basis from 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">On 1 October 2010 a total of 81 fishing vessels had been issued with a safety certificate or clearance for such and since then a further 8 vessels have received clearance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">In addition, a further 43 vessel owners have contacted the Department with a view to achieving a certificate, and the Marine Survey Office is processing these. From contacts between officials of my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food there may still be 20 or so older vessels that have not made contact. It is a matter for each vessel owner in question to do so if it is his or her intention to continue to use the vessel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">The regulations are focused on the main safety issues for fishing vessels including the integrity of the hull and vessel stability. Such requirements are fundamental to the safety of all fishing vessels and apply to inshore boats as for others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">Any decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels would be a matter for the Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and I have no function in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1748">The legislative basis for the application of immobilisation devices to vehicles that are illegally parked on public roads is set out in Section 101(<i>b</i>) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended.  Under this legislation, an authorised person can fix an immobilisation device (clamp) to a vehicle parked in contravention of any prohibition or restriction imposed under Sections 35, 36 and 36A of the Road Traffic Act 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">Powers to clamp vehicles are also available to the Gardaí and local authorities under Section 97 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">The Road Traffic (Immobilisation of Vehicles) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 247 of 1998) prescribe, inter alia, the amount that can be charged for the removal of an immobilisation device.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 to 2006 set out parking controls for the purposes of section 35.  Parking controls for the purposes of sections 36 and 36A are set out in any byelaws made by a local authority under those provisions.  These regulations and byelaws only have application in respect of vehicles illegally parked on public roads or in local authority car parks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">The regulations include a provision which identifies those classes of persons who may be authorised to apply and remove immobilisation devices, and determine that such persons shall consist of members of the Gardaí, traffic wardens and any person appointed in writing for such purposes by a local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">These regulations only have application in respect of vehicles illegally parked on public roads or in local authority car parks and only by the abovementioned persons.  The practice of clamping or the removal of vehicles on private property does not come within the scope of Road Traffic legislation.  The issue of requirements for setting up any company is a matter of company law and is not a matter for my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1755">The Kerry/Dublin Public Service Obligation (PSO) route  is operated under the current Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts for services linking Dublin Airport with the regional airports at Derry, Donegal, Sligo, Ireland West Airport Knock, Galway and Kerry Airports.  These contracts commenced on 22 July 2008 and are due to expire on 21 July 2011. The specifications required for the service, including the stipulation that three return flights per day would be required, were set out in the tender Notice which was published in the EU Journal in January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">In the case of the Kerry route, following the EU public tendering process, a bid submitted by Ryanair, which met the above requirements, emerged as the winner.  The bid from Ryanair also set out the compensation it required in order to operate the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">Based on that bid, Ryanair was awarded the contract to provide the scheduled air services over the three year contract period and are receiving payments in accordance with the contract.  The contract does not include a provision for binding arbitration and I have no plans to enter into such a process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">However, the contract does include termination clauses, including a specific provision for termination by mutual agreement in the event of the rejection of a proposal for additional compensation and three months notice being given.   It also provides for unilateral termination if either party gives the other at least six months notice of termination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">I can assure the Deputy that I have fully met my obligations under the terms of the contract and must comply with the requirement of European Law in relation to the operation of the PSO contracts governed by Regulation 1008/2008.  It is a matter for Ryanair to ensure that it also meets its obligations under the contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_1762">I would remind the Deputy that a provision which prohibits upward only rent review clauses in future business leases is contained in Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  That provision came into force on 28 February last.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">The prohibition on upward only rent review clauses does not apply to business leases (or agreements for such leases) which were entered into prior to the commencement of the section.  Advice was sought from the Office of the Attorney General as to whether or not the prohibiting provision could be applied retrospectively.  It was indicated that wholesale interference with existing leases was not a feasible option.  Real legal and constitutional difficulties would arise if property rights were to be affected retrospectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has indicated that they are not aware of any recommendation made by Forfas of the type suggested by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1776">At the outset I would like to advise the Deputy that documents submitted by an applicant as evidence of identity or nationality, or in support of a case to be permitted to remain in the State, can only be returned to that applicant once the case has had a definitive outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">Insofar as the case referred to by the Deputy is concerned, the person had a Deportation Order made against him on 29 May, 2006 and once this Order was served, on 2 June, 2006, the documents referred to by the Deputy were retained by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). This Order was challenged by way of judicial review proceedings which, when finalised, resulted in the Deportation Order being revoked on 14 August, 2008, and the case returned to my Department for further consideration. The case was finalised on 19 September 2008 with the person concerned having been granted permission to remain in the State with effect from that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">A number of requests were received from the person concerned seeking the return of his documents and all such requests were responded to with an indication that the sought documents were not on the Department's file. This was the factual position at those times. These documents were returned by the GNIB to my Department in early July 2010 and were returned to the person concerned under cover of a letter dated 5 July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">I can assure the Deputy that there was no intention on the part of any person in my Department to withhold the documents concerned once this case had a definitive outcome, which it did since 19 September 2008. Equally, I am entirely satisfied that once these documents were returned to my Department, they were returned to their owner without delay. I am satisfied also that there was no connection between the request being made by the relevant solicitor and the return of the documents.  Had the documents been in my Department's possession at an earlier date, they would have been returned sooner.</p>

            <p eId="para_1781">The general moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the Public Service continues to apply to An Garda Síochána.  The purpose of initiating a Garda recruitment campaign at this time is to establish a panel of approved candidates who will be available to meet future Garda recruitment needs in line with Government policy. I was happy to obtain the approval of my colleague the Minister for Finance for this competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">This forward planning is necessary given the lead time involved both in establishing such a panel and in training recruits to the point of attestation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">The Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 allow the Public Appointments Service to give due recognition to any satisfactory service by the person as a reserve member of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">Service in the Garda Reserve is voluntary and unpaid. Members of the Garda Reserve receive an allowance of €1,000 on the proviso that they complete 208 hours of duty per annum. The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve. It has been a very successful initiative and I am confident that it will continue to flourish into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1786">The increase in activities in recent months by these supposed republicans, the so-called dissidents, is obviously a matter of concern for the Government.  I know that all Members of the House will join me in condemning these groups without reserve.  The Independent Monitoring Commission has outlined the range of criminal activity in which they are involved, and we should be clear that these people are no more than criminals using violent means in pursuit of their own ends. They have no support in the wider community for their criminal ends or for their violent means.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">I can assure the House that the Gardaí continue to co-operate seamlessly with the PSNI in actively pursuing these groups.  The Garda Commissioner has stated that he regards an attack on the PSNI as an attack on the Garda Síochána, an attitude shared by the Government.  The Chief Constable of the PSNI has also referred to the excellent operational relationship between the two forces.  This close level of operational co-operation has been instrumental in recent months in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives, and it will continue to be an essential element in bringing these criminals to book.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">It is only right to record the fact that the Garda Síochána and its counterparts in Northern Ireland have had significant successes.  Since the start of this year the Gardaí have arrested over 50 people believed to be members of these groups and over 20 are at present before the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">Facing up to these groups is a priority for the Garda Síochána and, in support of this aim, the Government has maintained a high level of resources for the Force.  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that he has the resources he needs at his disposal in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">We will continue, in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, to spare no effort to ensure that those thugs who seek to subvert the democratic will of the people will face the full rigours of the law.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1792">There were a number of recommendations in the Special Group Report (McCarthy) which referred to the Justice Sector, across nine different programme areas. In all these recommendations identified €134.5m in potential savings; €84m of which related to staffing and payroll costs, €16.3m to operational efficiencies, €14.6m related to structural reform and rationalisation and a further €21.5m referred to other expenditure and funding reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">A number of the measures in the report have been implemented at this stage in order to achieve reductions in the Departments Estimates for 2010. These relate to the programmes in a range of subheads which include Gender Mainstreaming, Graffiti Removal Operations, Equality Monitoring Consultative Committees, European Refugee Fund and Refugee Integration. The McCarthy Report  recommended a total reduction of some €5 million in respect of these particular items. The actual budgetary reduction was €6.92 million. I should add that some of these areas are under the responsibility of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs since June, this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">A significant proportion of the recommendations (€84 million) related to reductions in payroll costs on items such as allowances payable to members of the Garda Síochána and the Prisons Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">In common with all Departments, there are significant reductions in payroll related provisions in 2010 to take account of the reductions in payroll rates and other factors. The overall reduction in gross payroll budgets for the Justice Sector compared with the 2009 estimate is in the region of €126 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">A number of recommendations were made by the McCarthy Group on structural reform and rationalisation across the Justice and Equality Sector. Decisions in respect of a number of these recommendations will be a matter for decision by Government in due course. In other cases  progress is being made on measures such as the reduction of staffing in the Children's Detention Schools under the ambit of the Irish Youth Justice Service. Any expenditure reductions arising will be reflected in the budget for the Sector in future years as appropriate. A number of the recommendations in this context refer to the Equality, Disability, Integration and Human Rights areas, which are now the responsibility of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">While it was never the intention that the full €134 million reduction recommended in the McCarthy report would be delivered in 2010, significant progress in this regard has been made. This is through a combination of the recommendations in the report and other measures being taken as part of the Governments budgetary policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1825">In 2008, the RIA expenditure on asylum seeker accommodation was €91.5m, in 2009 the figure was €86.5m while to end September, 2010 the figure was €57.9m. The estimates provision for 2010 is €77.492m.</p>

The RIA is currently operating 47 centres across 20 counties providing accommodation to 6,300 asylum seekers. In line with recommendations of a Value for Money Report on the service published earlier this year, the RIA has continued to consolidate its accommodation portfolio, effecting closures and downsizing at a number of centres and has brought occupancy levels across the portfolio to in excess of 90%. As part of this consolidation process, the RIA has reduced contracted bed spaces by 686 to date in 2010 alone. The system of direct provision continues to prove the most efficient and effective means of meeting the State's international obligations in respect of the accommodation needs of asylum seekers.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 239 of 6 October 2010, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the British Government opted into Directive 2003/9/EC on the right to work of asylum seekers without any apparent implications for the common travel area; in view of this, to explain the reason he believes that the common travel area would be affected by Ireland opting into Directive 2009/52/EC or otherwise adopting measures to ensure that rogue employers who exploit undocumented workers would have to pay them.

            <p eId="para_1828">Each EU instrument has to be considered on its merits, including any Common Travel Area concerns that might arise and the outcome of those considerations in respect of one Directive does not necessarily bear on that for subsequent unrelated instruments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Question 142 of 13 May 2010 in which I set out the primary reason why Ireland did not participate in the adoption and application of the Directive 2003/9/EC.  In particular, the Government was concerned that by extending the right to work to asylum seekers would have a profoundly negative impact on application numbers, as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so.  This concern would exist irrespective of the position of the UK on the measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">Directive 2009/52/EC in contrast concerns illegal immigration.  This is an area where there is always a risk of displacement of illegal workers who by their very nature will be much more mobile in terms of moving between countries.</p>

However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.

            <p eId="para_1931">I propose to take Question Nos. 154 and 155 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Payment of rent supplement will continue as long as the person meets the qualifying conditions and satisfies the means test.  The overall aim of rent supplement is to provide short term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently over 96,000 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 60 per cent since the end of 2007.  Over 44,300 have been in payment for 18 months or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">The rental accommodation scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, highlights local authorities' specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities.  Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and in particular RAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that a total of 28,939 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005: 15,986 rent supplement recipients to RAS and a further 12,953 recipients to other social housing options.  In total, 14,000 recipients were transferred to RAS and social housing in 2008 and 2009; achieving targets set for RAS transfers for these years.  The current target for 2010 is for a total of 8,000 rent supplement tenants to be provided with a housing solution by local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">In consultation with the Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has approved a number of pilot programmes in different local authorities to increase the flow of transfers.  These include allowing applicants for RAS to seek out their own properties which, subject to compliance with the normal conditions and the agreement of the landlord, may then be taken into the leasing programme.  Approved housing bodies under the leasing initiative have also been advised that they can seek applicants for social housing support directly from households in long term receipt of rent supplement as part of a of choice-based lettings approach to allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of RAS implementation groups.  The purpose of these Groups is to ensure that the RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.  It is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions, and do not distort the market in any way.  The use of maximum rent limits established for each county achieves this purpose.  The most recent rent limit review established new maximum rent limits effective from June 2010.  The new limits were benchmarked against the most up to date market data available at that time.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement can obtain suitable accommodation within the private rented market.  The new limits applied immediately to all new rent supplement applications and for all existing rent supplement claims once they were reviewed or renewed by the relevant community welfare officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1937">Allied with achieving value for money for the Exchequer it is also necessary to ensure that low income families are not paying ‘distorted' rents, above the market rate, due to higher than required maximum rent limits for a given area.  The outcome of the review was that maximum rent limits were reduced by a weighted average of 4%, the majority of reductions centred on two and three bedroom properties, assisting low income families with more affordable accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1938">The reduction of rent limits will not impact on rent supplement recipients' disposable incomes.  The minimum contribution, which is currently €24, is the amount that every applicant must pay from their own resources for their accommodation needs; this has not been altered in any way.</p>

         asked the

         the position regarding the carers strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [36935/10]

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_512">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1967">During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.  Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.  Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.  These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  The Government will continue to support carers within the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1973">Since April 2000 the needs of asylum seekers are catered for under the direct provision system operated by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Under the system asylum seekers are provided with full board accommodation and other facilities such as laundry services and access to leisure areas.  To take account of the services provided, a direct provision allowance of €19.10 per adult per week and €9.60 per child per week is payable in respect of any personal requisites required.  The payment of this weekly direct provision allowance is being made on an administrative basis by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">The principal consideration in making a single payment of SWA to address a particular need is that the need to be met must be ‘exceptional'.  Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice.  Thus, an exceptional needs payment should be a single payment to meet an unforeseen and/or special need which cannot be met from a client's basic income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.   There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need.  The expense incurred in emergency visits abroad or the purchasing of a car by foreign nationals or asylum seekers would not be considered appropriate to the exceptional needs payment provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1977">The Department is aware that there have been reports from time to time that asylum seekers, refugees and foreign nationals are in receipt of special payments through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for certain items that would not be of an essential or exceptional nature.  These reports are without foundation; insofar as it is possible to identify the individual cases about which the allegations were made, no such payments are, or have ever been made in this regard through the scheme or through any other social welfare support system.</p>

This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">In the case in question an application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received on 4th February 2010.  This application was referred to one of the Department's Medical Assessors who found that the child was not medically eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance.  A letter issued on 8 th March 2010 where the person concerned was advised of the decision to refuse the allowance.  The person concerned subsequently lodged an appeal against this decision.

         asked the

         if he is satisfied that when a decision is made by the social welfare appeals office to recommend a person for an oral hearing that it is taking approximately 12 months from the date this person's appeal is first registered with her Department to hold an oral hearing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2065">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office there are currently 20,781 appeals being processed.   There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal must be sought in each case.  On the return of the papers and comments to the Social Welfare Appeals Office the case is referred to an Appeals Officer who will either make a decision summarily based on the documentary evidence or, if s/he considers it necessary, will list the case for oral hearing.   Given the logistics involved in organising an oral hearing, a considerable period of time is added to the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are being dealt with in chronological order.  A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard 2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,  a number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office, the organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity, a project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.   I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_2070">Prior to the introduction of the Programme of Decentralisation in May 2004, the names of Clerical Officers and Staff Officers applying for transfers were recorded on departmental transfer lists in accordance with formal protocols agreed between the Civil, Public and Services Union (CPSU) and the Department of Finance.  There were no formal protocols for other grades in the civil or public service, however informal transfer lists were maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">Following the introduction of the Programme of Decentralisation, the Central Applications Facility (CAF), which is administered by the Public Appointments Service, was established to record transfer applications in respect of all grades, across the civil and public service.  Vacancies which fall to be filled by way of transfer are filled by reference to these lists in strict order of application date and the Department has no discretion in this regard.  The position therefore is that the person in question can only be considered for a transfer when her place on the relevant transfer list has been reached.</p>

            <p eId="para_2101">I have acknowledged on many occasions that we are currently in a very challenging period for Irish tourism.  Great Britain remains our single most important market in terms of overseas visitor numbers and that market has been notably challenging in recent years due to the domestic economic conditions pertaining there and particularly the unfavourable sterling exchange rate.   Furthermore, the exceptional weather conditions in the early part of the year and the closure of airports, particularly in Britain and Ireland, in April and May due to the volcanic ash cloud meant that the early months of this year were particularly difficult in terms of visitors from Great Britain.  In fact, the most recent statistics, for June 2010, show that, while numbers from Great Britain to Ireland did fall by 3% in June 2010 over June 2009, Ireland outperformed other competing destinations in the British market as total UK trips to other EU member states, excluding the newer member states, fell by 5.4%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">Clearly, the statement by the Irish Hotels Federation reflected the genuine concerns in the industry as a result of these negative trends.  While the views of stakeholders are important and a valuable contribution to strategy , the statement did not seem to fully take account of the adverse external factors affecting the GB market, or indeed of the ongoing process by which Tourism Ireland constantly reviews its approach to its main markets, and develops its strategies in partnership and consultation with the industry — including the Irish Hotels Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">In fact, Tourism Ireland, in close consultation with the Irish tourism industry, completed a major review of the Great Britain market, known as "Project Britain" last year. This review recommended a new focus on value to counter the perceptions that Ireland is an expensive destination. The Review also highlighted the need to differentiate a holiday in Ireland from one in England, Scotland or Wales. These conclusions were put into practice through an extensive programme of activity by Tourism Ireland this year, including a major push around St. Patrick's Day and a strong value push for Leisure Tourism, Golf Tourism and Business Tourism. Overall, Tourism Ireland is investing over €12 million in marketing in Great Britain alone this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">In terms of the future, research has shown that interest in visiting Ireland remains strong in Great Britain. Tourism Ireland is continuing to review performance, in terms of both visitor numbers and visitor perceptions, and is working with the Irish tourist industry including the Irish Hotels Federation to maximise our impact in the market.  In this regard, Tourism Ireland recently convened a meeting of industry partners, including the Irish Hotels Federation, to consider the Great Britain market in advance of finalising plans for next year's marketing campaign there.  I look forward to launching these plans later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2108">Under the Sports Capital Programme, funding is allocated to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Since 1998 an amount of €730m has been allocated to 7,400 projects throughout the country.  This investment has transformed the quantity and quality of sports facilities throughout the country.   Given the current budgetary situation and the high level of outstanding commitments it was considered prudent to take stock prior to announcing the next round of the Programme and accordingly no date has been set for the next round of the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2109">The question of funding a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme will be a matter for discussion as part of the Annual Estimates process between the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport and the Department of Finance this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2111">The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, as published in July 2009, made a number of recommendations in respect of my Department and the Agencies under its aegis.  Specifically, the Special Group made proposals to reduce programme expenditure by almost €105 million in 2010 and to structurally reduce 170 staff across the department and its agencies.  It also proposed that consideration should be given to the discontinuation of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism as a Department in its own right. The Group's recommendations are outlined in Detailed Paper no. 2 of the Report.  The attached table outlines the recommendations and the annual saving identified by the Special Group in relation to my Department.  It also outlines the savings that will be achieved in 2010 in relation to each of the proposals, which amounts to almost €30m.  In addition to those outlined, further savings will be achieved in 2010 by reductions in allocations to various programmes across my Department which were not included in the Recommendations of the Special Group.  In all, savings of more than €35 million, or almost 7 per cent, were achieved in the Revised Estimates for 2010 for the Department's Vote Group compared to 2009.  Moreover, the Government's moratorium on staff recruitment and promotion and its incentivised early retirement scheme continue to achieve reductions in staff numbers across my Department and its Agencies.</p>

            <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2117">I propose to take Questions Nos. 187, 190, 191, 194 and 196 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">The Government has already introduced wide-ranging measures to promote the flow of credit within the economy, including the introduction of the Bank Guarantee Scheme, the 2009 Recapitalisation Scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  These have all contributed to the stabilisation of the banking sector with a view to facilitating the flow of credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2119">The 2010 Recapitalisation package builds on these earlier initiatives and includes additional support for enterprises, including small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs).  In particular, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011, including funds for working capital for businesses.  Furthermore, the Credit Review Office was established to ensure that the banks are not refusing credit to viable businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2120">In addition, my Department has been actively participating in the work of the Credit Supply Steering Group, which has been examining the availability of credit generally to businesses.  The Irish Hotels Federation is also represented on this Group together with other representative groups, Government Departments and the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">With specific regard to tourism, culture and sport, safeguarding existing jobs and supporting job creation can only be achieved by promoting the robustness and vibrancy of these sectors.  I have sought at every opportunity to do just that.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">It is Government policy and mine as Minister with responsibility for the sector to develop and support the tourism industry in partnership with those bodies, such as the Irish Hotels Federation, that represent tourism business.  Despite the difficulties in our public finances, the Government increased the tourism services budget in 2010 by providing more than €153 million, which is an increase of 3 per cent over the 2009 outturn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">The State tourism agencies are maintaining their marketing drives to attract overseas and domestic tourists to holiday in Ireland. Tourism Ireland is continuing its marketing activities in Great Britain, mainland Europe and North America this Autumn highlighting ease of access, great fares and offers from the industry and showcasing the wonderful holiday experiences available here.  Here at home, Fáilte Ireland's €4 million home holiday marketing programme is continuing with the Autumn offering launched during September.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">In 2010, Fáilte Ireland is investing more than €11 million in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.  Business supports are aimed at assisting key tourism businesses to increase their international customer base, better manage their cost base, improve overall performance and sustain employment levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">The Government further demonstrated its commitment to tourism by its inclusion of tourism in a range of cross-cutting measures — including the Employment Subsidy Scheme, the Work Placement Programme, the Credit Review System and incentives for investment in energy-efficiency — all of which support sustainable tourism enterprises and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">Tourism businesses accessed the second call for applications under the Employment Subsidy Scheme, under which total support of €65 million is available to protect vulnerable employment.  The take-up of this scheme in the hotel sector was very strong.  Further specific measures that are helping tourism include the changes in alcohol excise duties and VAT and the free rail travel initiative aimed at senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad.  The reduction in alcohol excise duties will result in lower hospitality costs to our visitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">With regard to culture, the Government and I remain committed to supporting and funding this sector within financial resources to ensure the maintenance of as much employment as possible.  My policy is to promote and strengthen the culture sector in all its forms, increase access to and participation in culture, make culture an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism, including employment.  I will endeavour to maximise funding for these sectors, given its centrality to our economic and social well being.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">The sports sector is also a major contributor to the economy, a contribution which includes sports tourism, ticket sales, subscriptions and the cost of playing sport, together with the purchase of sports equipment and an economic value of time given by volunteers.  There is also a very extensive financial dividend to be obtained through the success of major sporting events, particularly those with an international dimension.  With specific regard to employment, the Irish Sports Council, through its grant funding to the National Governing Bodies, supports a large number of jobs throughout the country.  The Department's capital expenditure, through its Sports Capital Programme and Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, is also a major contributor to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2129">Across the tourism, culture and sport sectors, I remain in ongoing contact and consultation with the key stakeholders so that my Department's policy and other responses to the needs of these sectors remain current, proportionate, targeted and effective.</p>

            <p eId="para_2136">I propose to take Question Nos. 198 and 203 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">Research carried out as part of the preparation of the River Basin Management Plans estimated that as many as 25,000 septic tanks have the potential to impact on ground-waters and 120,000 have the potential to impact on surface waters, due to their location in vulnerable areas.  Therefore, there is considerable urgency in reviewing both the technical standards for new build and setting an appropriate inspection and maintenance regime for existing systems to address the situation.  The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Code of Practice on Waste water Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses which was published in October 2009 sets out comprehensive requirements in relation to the site assessment, design, installation and maintenance of on-site waste water systems.  My Department issued a circular letter to planning authorities in January 2010 regarding implementation of the EPA's new Code of Practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">Elements of the Code relevant to building control will be provided for in the revised Technical Guidance Document (TGD) H — Drainage and Waster water Disposal — which will accompany the amendment to Part H of the Building Regulations which I hope to complete shortly.  This follows a comprehensive review, including a three month public consultation process which closed on 8 March 2010, undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the Building Regulations Advisory Body.  The proposed revised TGD H includes specific guidance on the current harmonised European product standards (IS EN 12566 series) for waste water treatment systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on the owner of a premises to ensure that treatment systems for waste water which are not in the charge of a water services provider (i.e. septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems) are kept so as not to (a) cause, or be likely to cause, a risk to human health or the environment, including waters, the atmosphere, land, soil, plants or animals, or (b) create a nuisance through odours. Non-compliance with the duty of care requirement is an offence.  Extensive powers of inspection and enforcement are provided under the Water Services Act to facilitate the implementation of the duty of care provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">My Department will work with local authorities in ensuring that future county development plans, taking account of river basin management plans and other water quality legislation, address this issue pro-actively so that rural communities continue to provide for their housing needs in tandem with protecting water quality.</p>

            <p eId="para_2142">As indicated in the reply to Question No. 290 of 6 October 2010, my Department is currently reviewing the Retail Planning Guidelines which were originally published in 2001 and updated in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">Among the principles guiding the review are the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">competition to the benefit of the consumer should be maintained and enhanced in accordance with proper planning and sustainable development;</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">existing retail development-type definitions and relevant floorspace limits should be assessed to determine whether they remain appropriate or whether they need to be amended;</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">preferred locations for retail development should continue to be guided by considerations of sustainable land use, including access by public transport;</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">in particular, new retail development should be encouraged to contribute to the vitality and vibrancy of town and village centres, to ensure that they retain retailing as a core function; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">realistic, regionally consistent and forward-looking strategies for plan-led retail development should be devised which can give clear guidance to planning authorities, developers and shop owners in formulating development or expansion proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">An Issues Paper, which set out high-level and strategic issues for retail planning, was published in June 2010 to provide an opportunity for stakeholders and interested parties to assist in identifying key issues to be considered in the context of preparing and drafting revised guidelines.  Almost 200 submissions were received by the closing date of 30 July, and the issues raised in these submissions are currently being examined in drafting the updated guidelines.  It is intended that revised draft guidelines will be published for consultation before the end of the year, thus affording interested parties a further opportunity to input into the process before the guidelines are finalised.</p>

Recommendations in the Report relating to my Department are reflected, <i>inter alia</i>  , in savings in administrative costs arising from reductions in public service numbers and pay; the reduced Exchequer contribution to the Local Government Fund (€226 million in 2010, in the context of wider developments relating to local government finance); the review of the EPA which is underway; the ongoing rationalisation of agencies in the housing area; and more extensive use of leasing to ensure overall housing output is maintained at the highest level possible.  The Report will continue to be taken into account in the development of policy and the management of programmes by my Department. Consistent with the approach of the Special Group, the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group , published in mid-July, includes  recommendations for efficiency and other savings in the local government sector to be attained in the short, medium and long terms.  The findings and recommendations will be considered by Government in the appropriate policy and financial contexts.

            <p eId="para_2178">The renewed Programme for Government contains commitments to introduce a new system for the financing of local government, ensuring the viability of local services, and that Government policy for the reform of Local Government is implemented.  The Programme further commits to the introduction of charging for treated water use that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">The revenue base of local authorities was broadened in 2009 by the introduction in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 of a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is payable in respect of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and other non-principal private residences.  As at 13 October 2010, the non-principal private residence charge had raised €66,532,480 in respect of 2009 and €61,689,020 to date in respect of 2010.

            <p eId="para_2184">I am working closely with the Ministers for Social Protection and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and others on the inter-Departmental Steering Group to finalise the affordable energy strategy, which, due to the complexity of data being gathered, has necessitated a more intensive analysis than was previously envisioned.  However, I expect to be in a position to bring the strategy to Government soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">This strategy will set out a framework to ensure that households can achieve affordable access to their energy requirements through a range of practical initiatives and programmes designed to reduce the demand for energy, thus protecting those considered most at risk of energy poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2186">The strategy applies a holistic approach, combining national and geographically focussed actions in the areas of income supports, targeted and tailored energy efficiency improvements, and advice and information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2187">The strategy also reviews existing definitional constructs and will identify an appropriate methodology for the ongoing measurement and reporting of energy poverty in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">Provisional findings suggest that dwelling age is a key indicator of energy poverty.  As a result, enhancing the energy efficiency of homes through structural improvements will remain a pivotal action in the strategy to address long-term energy affordability.  This year will see energy efficiency upgrades delivered to at least 22,500 homes, bringing the total number of homes upgraded since 2000 to nearly 60,000 by year end.</p>

            <p eId="para_2311">The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which has passed all stages in the Seanad and has completed Second Stage in the Dáil, aims to modernise and strengthen the existing arrangements for the making of EROs and REAs and to provide for their more effective operation. To this end, the Bill provides for a number of amendments to the existing legislative framework surrounding the JLC and REA systems, including improved procedures, and clear principles and policies to be taken into account by JLCs when formulating proposals for EROs. The Bill also provides that EROs and REAs will be given legal effect in future by Ministerial Order and that a perceived gap in the scope of parliamentary supervision will be filled by providing for Oireachtas scrutiny of these instruments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">I also announced at the time of the publication of the Bill that I propose to introduce an additional provision in the Bill — to be effected by means of an amendment to the Bill at Committee Stage — to facilitate the inclusion in EROs and REAs of an "inability to pay" mechanism, along the lines of the mechanism provided in the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 in the interests of further strengthening these mechanisms against future court challenges and to protect employment in situations where employers are faced with severe economic challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">My Department and I will continue to monitor developments in this area on an ongoing basis and I would encourage all parties to these agreements to recognise that a little responsiveness and flexibility in the operation of the statutory wage determination machinery would go a long way towards securing jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2317">The Consumer Protection Act 2007 does, however, prohibit traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices, including engaging in misleading practices such as providing false information in relation to the geographical or commercial origin of goods. Accordingly any trader, be they a retailer or an etailer, who provides false information as to the origin of goods that they sell and where such information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the consumer would not otherwise make, may be committing an offence under the Consumer Protection Act 2007. Evidence of traders engaging in such practices should be brought to the attention of the National Consumer Agency in order that it may be investigated.</p>

            <p eId="para_2457">International benchmarking statistics reveal that Ireland imposes a relatively low burden of regulation on business.  The Forfás Annual Competitiveness Report 2010 states that Ireland's regulatory environment is one of the least restrictive in the OECD in relation to product market regulation, the time taken to comply with tax payments is one of the lowest in the OECD across all categories and Ireland's employment framework is less rigid than the OECD average.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">The work to reduce red tape in Ireland is being progressed on two fronts. The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business; and an Inter-Departmental Group of officials from all Departments, having regulation affecting business, coordinates the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognized Standard Cost Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">The High Level Group has processed thirty specific red tape issues brought to its attention by business and continues to drive progress on a further thirty-eight items. To date, the Group has measured over €20m of annual business savings and continues to work with business interests.  In addition, further burden reductions achieved, and in the process of being measured, will contribute to the Government's overall target of 25% administrative burden reduction by 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">The measurement of administrative burdens using the Standard Cost Model is an exercise that was called for by business, as a baseline for the 25% administrative burden reduction programme, and is being carried out across all Departments with any substantive regulation that affects business.  My Department and the Central Statistics Office have already measured burdens arising from regulations under their responsibility, and all other relevant Departments will shortly measure the current red tape costs on business arising from their regulation.  Measurement is expected to be completed in 2011 and, following this, simplification plans will be developed in consultation with stakeholders, for implementation.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise__Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_568">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise; Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2462">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation</p>
            <p eId="para_2463">I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 11 May, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits  processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2464">In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims has improved and claims dating from March 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2465">My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include: · Almost doubling the number of staff   working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</p>
            <p eId="para_2466">Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget   towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_2467">Establishment of a special call handling facility   in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_2468">Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_2469">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.   In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first nine months of 2010 was 58,202 — up over 81% on the corresponding 9-month period in 2009 (32,127) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009 which came to 50,644.  The backlog of claims is decreasing — reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 29,776.</p>
            <p eId="para_2471">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise; Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2473">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2474">I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.   It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  The documentation required in support of lump sum claims, is set out hereunder and is available on my Department's website at <i>www.entemp.ie.</i>  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50’s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">The documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2476">If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2477">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.

        <b>Deputy Frank Feighan</b>

         the position regarding redundancy payments in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Leitrim.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise; Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2479">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2480">I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individuals in question for the company mentioned. It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  The documentation required in support of lump sum claims, is set out hereunder and is available on my Department's website at <i> www.entemp.ie</i>.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50’s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_2481">The documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2482">If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2483">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_2501">As indicated previously in reply to Questions in this House, the 20-year Strategy for Irish was published in draft form to facilitate a further round of public consultation on the proposals contained in it by the relevant Oireachtas Joint Committee.  The Joint Committee held meetings with relevant interests, including one meeting in the Gaeltacht, and subsequently agreed a submission with a range of recommendations.   I received the Committee's recommendations on 28 July 2010 and these have been under examination by my Department in consultation with other relevant Departments.  I anticipate that these consultations will be completed shortly and that a final draft of the Strategy can be brought to the Cabinet Committee on Irish, and subsequently to Government, in the near future.   Proposals in regard to investment programmes for the Gaeltacht, outlined in the Infrastructure and Investment Priorities 2010 to 2016 report that was published by the Department of Finance in July 2010, remain under consideration. As the Deputy will be aware, all of the figures are indicative at this time and the 2011 allocations will not be decided until the Estimates process is completed within the framework of the forthcoming Budget. In the context of the 20-year Strategy, these issues will be considered further by my Department having regard to the resources that will be available in 2011 and future years.  As the Deputy will appreciate, in the present financial circumstances objectives will have to be pursued with less resources than previously.  However, despite these constraints, my Department is committed to making significant progress and to achieving value for money in the implementation of the Strategy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2503">As the Deputy is aware, the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes presented a set of options to reduce expenditure and staff numbers across the public sector. These options were considered by the Government within the context of framing the 2010 Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2504">Gross savings of some €57 million, or almost 12%, were achieved in the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) for the Vote of the then Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, relative to the 2009 REV.  While the allocations in most expenditure programmes were reduced, the primary concern was to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services provided with funding from my Department were protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">With regard to the reduction in staff numbers, the Government's moratorium on staff recruitment and promotion and other associated measures, including the incentivised early retirement scheme, have achieved, and continue to achieve, reductions in staff numbers across my Department and relevant agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">In terms of specific recommendations by the Special Group, one key recommendation was predicated on the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs being dissolved and its functions transferred to other Departments. Other recommendations related to the abolition or transfer between Departments of specified functions. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that, as part of the restructuring of Departments and agencies announced in March last by the Taoiseach to ensure greater coherence and produce more efficient delivery, my Department has taken over responsibility for (i) social inclusion policy and family policy from the Department of Social Protection and (ii) equality, disability, integration and human rights from the Department of Justice and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">In relation to other recommendations by the Special Group, it may be noted that</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">The funding of a number of programmes referred to is subject to ongoing consideration of options in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2509">The Government's key objective in the <i>cohesion</i>   process at this time is to ensure greater efficiencies and value for money through the new Local and Community Development Programme.  This will be subject to robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. It will be implemented through a single delivery structure in each area from 1st January 2011.  The number of local community development groups (incorporating Partnerships and LEADER companies) has already reduced from 94 to 52.  The consolidation/reduction of other structures under my Department’s remit, for example, Family Resource Centres, will be reviewed over the coming period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">The future of the Western Development Commission remains under consideration in the context of the ongoing general review of enterprise structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">The drafting of a Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill, which will, inter alia, dissolve the Dormant Accounts Board, is underway. It is anticipated that the Bill will be published during the present parliamentary session.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">Options in relation to the future functions of the Family Support Agency are under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">Proposals relating to the reallocation of some functions of the Equality Tribunal will fall to be considered in the context of the review of the equality and human rights bodies currently under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">Responsibility for the Community Services Programme has transferred to the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">The Gaeltacht Housing Grant Scheme was suspended in April 2009. While existing commitments under the scheme continue to be met, no new commitments have been created since that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">Other issues with regard to the funding of Irish language/Gaeltacht programmes and the future role of Údarás na Gaeltachta are subject to ongoing consideration in the context of both the forthcoming Budget and the anticipated publication of the 20-year Strategy for Irish. The draft Strategy was published some time ago and has been subject to review by the relevant Oireachtas Committee. It is anticipated that the matter will be re-submitted to Government in the coming period. It may be noted that there is no requirement under the Official Languages Act that all official publications be translated into Irish.  The requirement applies only to a limited range of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">The Deputy will appreciate that, in the context of the foregoing, any calculation of savings arising would be premature at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_2547">*The reduction in Ireland's participation in KFOR was designed to deliver savings in line with the recommendations of the Special Group and as an alternative to a withdrawal from the UN operation in Chad and the Central African Republic (MINURCAT). Unfortunately it became necessary to withdraw from the Chad mission in May 2010. The financial implications of the early withdrawal are not shown in the above table due to some uncertain factors including the amount and timing of re-imbursements from the UN. Savings of c.€8m on a full calendar year basis are forecast to arise from this withdrawal. Similarly, full year savings of c. €12m are expected to arise due to the Kosovo downsizing. Options for future overseas deployments are currently being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">In the context of Budget 2011 all opportunities for cost reductions are being critically examined.  Within the resources available I intend to retain the capacity of the Defence organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.</p>
