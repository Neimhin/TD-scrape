I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted notices to my office.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter: the deteriorating situation in Burma/Myanmar and the need for the European Union and its member Parliaments to discuss the matter and issue statements of unequivocal support for the movement for democracy in that country and of concern for the safety of those who are demonstrating.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter: the need to put in place accessible, 24 hour, seven day psychiatric and social care services to address the urgent needs of people at risk from suicide and self harm, given the high level of suicide in Irish society.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12713	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter: the proposal under the national cancer strategy to close 13 cancer services located throughout the country, particularly breast cancer services at Mallow General Hospital.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them in order under Standing Order 32.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	A Cheann Comhairle, I ask you to consider allowing the matter of Burma/Myanmar to be raised in another way.  There is a precedent for not allowing matters to be raised under Standing Order 32 because they lack urgency.  I cannot think of a topic so clearly urgent as the threat to the lives of people demonstrating for democracy on the streets.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is proposed to take No. 11, motion re Shannon Airport and development of the mid-west region on the conclusion of No. 16.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 11 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speeches of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.  Private Members' business shall be No. 16, motion re cancer services (resumed), to be taken immediately after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Government has published its legislative programme for this session.  It contains 17 Bills which, it is expected, will be published between now and the start of the next session.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I wish to raise a matter concerning No. 11.  The time allocated for No. 11 is shorter than was originally allocated for it.  A number of speaking slots will, therefore, be lost.  Will the Government consider adding half an hour to the time scheduled for this debate, to restore speaking slots which would have been available had the matter been discussed yesterday?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Unfortunately, I cannot accommodate the Deputy's request.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The legislative programme has been published by the Government.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I am not in a position to accommodate Deputy Stagg's request.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Why not?  It is only a matter of half an hour.

This is only a facilitation to allow for the widest possible participation in this important debate.  The request is not excessive, given today's schedule.  We finish earlier today than on other days of the week.  Surely the request can easily be acceded to?  Given the importance of the Shannon-Heathrow link and in the spirit of addressing the matter comprehensively, acceding to the request is the appropriate answer.  I join Deputy Stagg in appealing for a reconsideration of the Tánaiste's answer.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Yesterday's schedule was altered because of the decision of the Opposition to put down a confidence motion.  We are now dealing with the business as scheduled.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	For the third time, we have a list of 17 Bills to be published between the start of this session and the start of the next.  It is now 12 weeks since the Dáil last met.  The Government has done no work in putting together a structure for Dáil committees.  What Dáil committees is it proposed to form?  When can we expect proposals from the Government Whip on this matter?  How are these Bills to be dealt with if a committee structure is not in place?  Given the significantly increased membership of Fine Gael in the House, we have put proposals to the Government Whip that the d'Hondt system, which operates in most European countries, would apply in respect of membership of committees and responsibility for running them.  What committees will be established and when will we see proposals for their formation?It is, unfortunately, too late for the two firemen who lost their lives yesterday that I refer to the Farrell Grant Sparks report of 2002.  That report pointed out that it was 25 years since a major revamp of fire services throughout Ireland had been carried out and made recommendations to improve the situation.  Can we see a report on this matter in due course?The Tánaiste was Minister for Foreign Affairs during Ireland's last EU Presidency.  He did a good job.  During that time, Ireland opened diplomatic relations with the junta in Burma.  What is the present position in that regard?  Does Ireland have diplomatic relations with Burma?  If so, are they being used to bring to bear any impact in respect of what is happening there?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I join the Leader of the Opposition in conveying the sympathy of the House to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy who lost their lives while doing their job as fire fighters in Bray yesterday.  In regard to the fire service generally, we have completed the first phase of a fire service change and modernisation programme which focused initially on the enhancement of fire fighter health, safety and welfare.  There has been an updated auxiliary safety statement template for the service to comply with the 2005 legislation, with a new national incident command system, revised breathing apparatus guidelines and associated training and training materials, and a critical incident stress management system to assist fire fighters in dealing with the aftermath of traumatic and stressful incidents.  This matter is ongoing between the fire service and various local authorities.  There will be an investigation, carried out by the statutory authorities and agencies, the HSE, the Garda Síochána and Wicklow County Council, into this latest incident involving the tragic loss of the lives of two fire fighters.  We have asked the local authority to make its findings available to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.On the question of the committee structure, the Chief Whip has initiated discussions with the Opposition Whips with a view to arriving at a consensus in the coming week on how and which committees will operate.  That requires further discussion between the Whips.  I hope they can come to a conclusion as soon as possible, as it is in the interests of everyone in the House that we find an agreed way forward.In regard to the matter raised by Deputy Higgins, we work through the European Union mechanism, in the main, through ASEAN and ASEM, in dealing with the regime in question.  That regime is, rightly, a pariah in the international community.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that we should express our support for and solidarity with those who are trying to maintain basic civil and human rights for the Burmese people.  The reaction of the military regime in recent days is a cause for serious concern, particularly in view of what happened the last time there was a public protest on a large scale, which resulted in the loss of 3,000 lives when people were murdered in the streets. This is a regime which has practically cut itself off from all international engagements.  In the fora in which we dealt with that part of the world during our Presidency the attendance of the Burmese, let alone engagement with them, was a matter of serious dispute.  It behoves the international community to require the powers that operate in that region to use what limited powers they have in making sure the regime in Burma understands the international community will not tolerate a repetition of what happened in 1988 when there was a major conflagration in the streets.  This is a country which for more than 40 years now has been in the grip of a military junta and whose people have suffered greatly.  I hope their courageous efforts on this occasion will meet with greater success.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I too join the Tánaiste and Deputy Kenny in extending sympathy to the Murray and O'Shaughnessy families on their tragic loss yesterday.  When the period of grieving is over, the House might usefully return to the Farrell Grant Sparks report on the organisation of the fire service which was published in 2002.  Among its recommendations was the establishment of a national fire authority which might address the possibility of setting up a full-time fire service, as distinct from a part-time service, in larger urban areas.I have one issue to raise on the Order of Business.  I have been reading the schedule of business for next week.  It appears that many of the legislative proposals relate to matters which have, happily, waited over the summer period.  Would the Tánaiste consider making some time available next week to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House and discuss the deteriorating crime situation?  A man was shot in Finglas on Sunday.  A garda was shot in the course of his duty during the week.  There was another shooting last night.  We have a serious problem of gun crime and gangland shootings.  The House should have an opportunity of addressing it.  Given the relative lightness of business next week, will the Tánaiste arrange for a debate on crime with the Minister?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Consideration can be given to that matter in discussions between the Whips in preparation for next week's business.  The Government has been discussing it at some length at recent Cabinet meetings.  The Taoiseach has allowed a considerable amount of time for it in next week's agenda.  There was a further serious incident last night.  Occurring in the same week when a garda carrying out his duties on behalf of the public was so callously shot and injured, it is a reminder that there are people who are prepared to put human life at risk for their own selfish ends.  I reiterate the determination of the Government to rid society of that problem, with their co-operation and help.  I remind the House that we have undertaken an unprecedented programme of resourcing the Garda and reforming the criminal justice system, including a range of legislative measures to combat crime, in particular gun crime.  It is a phenomenon in our society, of which we must be wary and do everything we can to deal with it.  It indicates a deterioration in the fabric of our society that there are people of such a callous nature who are prepared to gun down unarmed gardaí who carry out their duties on our behalf and are a bulwark of our democratic life.

This is a tragedy that raises issues of safety and training and matters pertinent to the role of the volunteer fire fighter.  It is something we will have to address comprehensively at some time in the future.On the Order of Business, will the Government schedule a debate on the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which highlights what can only be described as scandalous mismanagement on the part of the Government in a whole raft of areas?  It relates not only to the Government but also to the HSE, specifically in regard to the ongoing cost of the failed PPARS.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also speaks about the continuing failure of the Government's public private partnership experiment.  The word "failure" is not too strong a word.  It is a matter we have both addressed previously, although taking opposite views.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred particularly to the experimental provision of five schools within the school system.  He has highlighted massive tax evasion by landlords and many other issues that must be addressed substantively.  We need to debate his most recent report.  Will the Government accommodate such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Debates on matters such as the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are normally dealt with in committee, be it the Committee of Public Accounts or the finance and the public service committee.  That is the means by which this is done.  They may also be considered in plenary session on the floor of the House if the Whips so decide.  There will be many opportunities, as there always are, to discuss reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General given his constitutional role.I do not agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin in respect of public private partnerships.  Such partnerships have played an important role in the physical and social regeneration of communities in O'Devaney Gardens, St. Michael's Estate and Ballymun.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	It is time to recognise the role played by public private partnerships.  They do not replace traditional procurement policy but they do play an important role in this area.  There are many examples of where they have proven to be of extraordinary assistance in transforming areas at great speed.  I have already named three.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	There probably will be one bright spot for us this year in terms of medals for sport.  All of our good wishes go with them.  I wish them the very best of luck.I received an assurance from the Taoiseach at the beginning of this session in respect of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004.  Many people hoping to buy their own homes are getting older and may not qualify for mortgages yet they see their neighbours, having purchased their homes, opting to sell and move on.  The Bill appears to have slipped from the list.  Will the Tánaiste tell the House the position in this regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I understand the Bill will be taken early next year.  I join with Deputy Lynch in sending best wishes to the athletes travelling to Shanghai.  I was glad to have been able to provide in my last budget a significant allocation to the organisation involved.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	If I may, I want to ask two questions of the Tánaiste.  On the proposed constitutional amendment on children's rights, a formulation of words was almost finalised prior to the general election.  Does the Government intend to proceed with one or two questions by way of advancing and protecting the rights of children and when will we see proposals in that regard?The Civil Unions Bill 2006 was deemed to have passed Second Stage during the summer recess.  The Tánaiste may recall that a vote was taken in the House to defer its passage for a period of time.  Does the Government intend to process the Bill through committee and if so, will it be done during this session?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	On the first matter, the Taoiseach, in response to questions yesterday, conveyed the wishes of the new Minister of State with responsibility for children to continue with the work engaged in by the committee established by the former Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  It is intended to establish a joint standing committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to provide it with the resources required to ensure the building of a consensus on the wording to be put to the people during the course of next year.On the Civil Unions Bill 2006, I am informed a Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 is awaiting referral to a committee.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Civil Union Bill 2006 was deemed to have passed Second Stage during the recess by order of this House.  The Bill does not appear on the Order Paper although it should.  Is it the Government's intention to proceed with it separate from the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I revert to the Deputy, the Bill is not, as he says, on the Order Paper.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	39	There was considerable disappointment and surprise that one of the first decisions made by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was the abolition of an important grant scheme which enabled householders to install renewable energy systems in their homes.  All we have now is the promise of a Supplementary Estimate for a very minimalist scheme.  When is it intended this Supplementary Estimate will be introduced and will the Tánaiste ensure sufficient money is provided to allow the scheme continue into the future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I have had discussions on the matter.  We are eager to ensure we plan for the years ahead in budgetary terms in order to allow people to meet their energy requirements through exploitation of the greener home scheme and various other schemes instigated by his predecessor.  The Minister, in an effort to ensure proper management of his budget this year, is making arrangements, by way of discussion, not alone for this year but for future years.  Detailed discussions in this regard will take place prior to the forthcoming budget.  Given the new budgetary reforms, the Estimates will show existing levels of service provision for next year with all taxation and expenditure decisions being made on budget day.I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of our discussions except to say that both the Minister and I, recognising the importance of these schemes and the role they can play in the future, intend to reach some decisions in our bilateral discussions.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I would like some clarification.  Does that mean all the talk about a Supplementary Estimate is nothing more than flim-flam?  A simple yes or no is all I want.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	No, it does not mean that.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Since the summer, we have witnessed extraordinary turmoil in the financial markets with depositors queueing outside Northern Rock to withdraw their money.  Given the Dáil was in recess, it was impossible to engage in any kind of debate with the Minister for Finance in respect of this important event and whether, in terms of our economic situation, there will be a need for Supplementary Estimates given the fall in revenues in respect of stamp duty.  The finance and public service committee seems nowhere near convening.  We do not know whether it will convene next month, the month after or Christmas.Will the Tánaiste allow time for a debate in respect of the enormous changes and turmoil in the economy here and on a worldwide basis?  Also, will he guarantee Irish bank depositors, over and beyond the minimal guarantee currently in operation, that their savings are secure even where they bank on-line?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Whips are responsible for the provision of time for economic debates in the House or in committee.  I have always welcomed such debates and look forward to such debate being arranged.On the general question raised by the Deputy, I am glad to say that the financial institutions in Ireland, under our regulatory and supervisory authorities, are in good shape and have a strong liquid position.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Is the Tánaiste saying he is willing to provide time for a debate?  This is probably the most important issue for many Irish homeowners.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom Fine Gael agus urlabhraí Fine Gael ar cúrsaí sláinte, an Teachta Reilly, a moladh as ucht an rún tábhachtach seo ar an cóir leighis don ailse a chuir síos.  Tá sé tráthúil go maith.  I compliment the Fine Gael Party and its health spokesperson, Deputy Reilly, for tabling this important motion which has been overtaken by yesterday's events and the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE of the location of the eight specialist cancer centres.  However, one must have misgivings about how the announcement will pan out.  For instance, no costings or budget have been prepared for the plan, yet a target has been set, whereby 50% of the plan will be implemented by the end of 2008 and 90% by the end of 2009.  Like many plans and projections set out by the Government parties for the roll-out of cancer services, this is very optimistic but I hope it happens.  According to the HSE, once implementation of the plan begins, cancer services at smaller hospitals will cease within 90 days, yet half the new services provided under the plan will only be available by the end of next year, with 90% available by the end of the following year.  What will happen in the interim?  Existing capacity is inadequate and if some of it is withdrawn within 90 days, what will happen to patients who lose services in their areas?Cancer survival rates in Ireland are improving but they are still below the European average.  The eight specialist centres using multidisciplinary teams are anticipated to increase survival rates by 20% under the criteria laid down.  This would be welcome.  Professor Keane said yesterday that when the plan was fully implemented, outcomes would improve within three or five years.  There is much to be commended in the new approach to the provision of cancer services but one must be sceptical about the delivery dates.  Waterford Regional Hospital has been selected as one of the eight specialist centres.  In 2005 we were given to understand that by 2011 radiotherapy services would be provided at the hospital but we learned recently that will happen by 2015 at best.  How does this tie in with the target of 50% implementation of the new plan by 2008 and 90% by 2009?  These target dates do not gel when examined carefully.During the debate yesterday evening the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hoctor, stated Ireland had 22,000 cancer patients and the number would increase to 43,000 by 2020, with two thirds of the increase attributable to an ageing population.  This is against a background of increased demand and the announcement of a new programme for which no budget or costings have been provided.  The Minister of State also stated last night that the Government was committed to providing substantial additional moneys but this is very vague and up in the air.  I reiterate that this statement has been made in the context of smaller hospitals ceasing cancer services within 90 days of the commencement of the new plan, as proposed by Dr. Keane.A number of issues arise in the context of smaller hospitals and areas not adjacent to the eight specialist centres.  I refer to designated transport and hostel accommodation.  While this has been discussed, it is absolutely and utterly vital that the issue should be addressed and patient friendly, workable solutions put in place.  With the number of cancer patients anticipated to increase by 21,000 between now and 2020 and two thirds of the increase attributable to the elderly, appropriate door-to-door transport will be required.  Every effort should be made to make the system as patient friendly as possible in all cases.The plan is welcome but the issues relating to cancer treatment have been highlighted in many documents, going back to the Hollywood report.  Improvements have been made but there is a long way to go.  Provision of services and patient outcomes are below the EU average.  Patient outcomes will not improve unless substantial investment is made.  In addition, significant planning is required to make sure staff will be available to take up the new posts that will emerge.  Issues may arise fairly quickly in the context of the plan.  It seems some staff will transfer from the 13 smaller hospitals that are to close, and they will take up positions in the eight regional centres.  More action is required.There is considerable under provision for palliative care throughout the country, particularly in the south-east.  There is a proposal relating to it but these services are all complementary and terribly necessary in the context of comprehensive and proper patient care.  I hope the thrust of this plan will come quickly and the inconveniences and difficulties experienced by patients in the smaller hospitals will be addressed.One must question the wisdom of closing hospital services within a period of 90 days when the programme has not been implemented.  I am concerned about a shortfall in the short to medium term, meaning the service will be worse in that time.  It is hard to be confident that transferring staff and related operations will be done effectively, efficiently and quickly, particularly when compared to some of the other undertakings by the HSE over a period.I very much welcome that Waterford Regional Hospital has been selected as one of the eight specialist cancer centres.  However, we must get delivery of the radiotherapy unit to the hospital so we can move on to a multi-disciplinary service necessary for the best patient outcomes.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	70	It is traditional on these occasions to compliment the movers of the motion and I am very happy to do so for my old friend, Deputy James Reilly.  Dr. Reilly and I served together over a long period on the old Eastern Health Board and the regional authority.  This was a time when the health board answered questions and did not leave public representatives to hear major announcements through the media.  Regrettably, those days have changed.I tabled a question asking the Minister for Health and Children the policies she has put in place to improve cancer treatment services nationwide, her plans for the future and if she would make a statement on the matter.  I received a nice letter from the Ceann Comhairle in which he kindly stated it could not be taken yesterday because the question anticipated private Members' business for the same day, which appears to give me a great deal of credit for something which I did not intend.Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan referred to the announcement yesterday, and it is generally welcomed as a good announcement, except that in my community in Tallaght there will be a different point of view.  I do not want to just cry about Tallaght but it is the third-largest population centre in the country, with a very significant catchment area.  The Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, serves people from north Kildare down to Carnew in Wicklow.  It provides a serious service.Cancer care in the Tallaght hospital has been a major strategic development over the past five years.  Although this area was always an important facet of patient care in Tallaght, the hospital board formalised it as one of the major strategies for the patient population.  This development was in recognition not alone of the volume of patients with cancer coming to the hospital but of the unfortunate fact that many patients coming to the hospital were disadvantaged.  This led to them presenting at a comparatively later stage of the disease.It was therefore seen as a major challenge to the hospital to improve survival in this patient population.  With this in mind a team of experts has been assembled within the hospital campus whose specialist interest is in cancer care.  These individuals have spent significant periods in cancer institutions located in the United States and in Europe, including New York, Washington, Madison, Paris and Milan.  They also have experience of many different dedicated cancer services in the nearby UK.It was also recognised that the major specialties involved in cancer care should be present on-site within the hospital campus.  As a result, consultants in all the specialty areas involved in cancer care, including surgical, medical and radiation oncology, as well as palliative care, have been appointed to Tallaght.  As such, a cancer patient entering the gates of the Tallaght hospital has the full range of specialty care available on-site.  Furthermore, in line with international best practice, the many different cancer types looked after within our hospital have dedicated multi-disciplinary teams.  In this manner, each cancer patient diagnosed within the hospital is given the opportunity not only to see individual specialists but to have decisions made in the context of multi-disciplinary team meetings, which has proven to be advantageous to survival.The hospital in Tallaght has decided to look after all the major cancer types in both men and women and has set up multi-disciplinary meetings for all these types.  Outside the hospital, important links have been set up with many different hospitals, including a very strong link with Naas General Hospital, St. James' Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, Peamount Hospital and many others.  It has also set up strong links with groups such as the Irish Cancer Society and the Marie Keating Foundation, and it has funding from the Health Research Board for cancer research.In 2006, the hospital saw more than 1,500 new cancers, with many more patients suspected of having cancer coming into dedicated clinics.  A major thrust over the past three years has been the establishment of a quality assurance programme in cancer care.  Computer software has been purchased and seven separate appointments have been put in place to form an audit programme.  Therefore, very close attention is paid to quality assurance in the patient population.A team of dedicated nurses has also been appointed in recent years to oversee the co-ordination of cancer care within the hospital, where attention to quality of life issues is paramount.  These nurse co-ordinators are trained in their field and they are a pivotal part of cancer care at the hospital in Tallaght.In summary, the cancer care at Tallaght hospital provides a comprehensive service for a large number of cancer patients, many of whom come from disadvantaged areas.  The hospital serves a rapidly increasing catchment area and provides the vast majority of cancer care for this network.  It is anticipated that the National Cancer Registry will report a doubling of the number of cancers within our area in the next 15 years.  Tallaght is very well positioned to meet this significant challenge.I notice many different comments at the beginning of yesterday's debate.  This morning I am making a point for Tallaght.  The HSE must consider its case, although the report from yesterday has been generally accepted.  Tallaght makes a strong case and it is different.  The Minister of State should convey to his senior colleague that this debate is only commencing.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and the improvements made in cancer services generally in recent years.  I particularly acknowledge the €1 billion investment since 1997 in cancer services, the appointment of 100 additional consultants and 300 additional clinical nurse specialists.In the few minutes available to me this morning I welcome the new strategy, which focuses on eight centres of excellence throughout the country.  I wish to highlight the case of Mayo General Hospital, where a standard of excellence has been achieved in cancer services, such as surgery, going back years.  I state this on the basis of the excellence achieved, not making any arguments on geographical grounds or on the social and economic circumstances people in this House are well aware exist in the west of Ireland.As any person who knows someone who has suffered with cancer is aware, it is critically important that the standard of outcome in Ireland is dramatically improved.  This must be our top priority.  One must, therefore, welcome the new strategy that was rolled out by the HSE yesterday in this regard.I wish to refer to breast cancer services at Mayo General Hospital.  In 2000 Professor Niall O'Higgins presented a report to the then Minister in which he stated the optimum level of procedures to be carried out by a surgeon in a given year is more than 50 but fewer than 100.  A total of 72 breast cancer procedures were carried out at Mayo General Hospital during the past year.  The radiographers at the hospital see in excess of 20 people per week and deal with in excess of 2,000 cases per year.  These figures represent the key indicators laid down in the O'Higgins report in respect of achieving a standard of excellence.  If a service is working, it should be allowed to continue to do so.  While I acknowledge that the centre of excellence will be located in Galway, the integrated service that has been in existence for the past seven years between Mayo General Hospital and Galway should continue into the future and should form part of the new cancer strategy.  I look forward to reviews being carried out that will substantiate the facts I have articulated.  Those facts clearly show that excellence is being achieved at Mayo General Hospital and that the service to which I refer should continue to be provided there.One of the issues of great importance to me, which I have highlighted in the House in recent years, relates to the roll-out of BreastCheck in the west.  As everyone is aware, the west and the south are the last parts of the country in which this essential service is being rolled out.  I welcome the particular dedication of the Minister, Deputy Harney, to this service.  In November, the static unit in Galway to deal with breast screening will be opened for the first time.  A mobile unit has been operational in Roscommon since April and thousands of women are now in a position to access breast screening services that were previously unavailable.  Negotiations to locate a mobile unit at Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar are at an advanced stage.  I ask that matters be expedited and that the service in Mayo commence operating before the end of this year or, at the latest, next January.  The incidence of breast cancer in the west is extremely high and the fact that this service has not been available to the women of the region until now is a disgrace.  It is important that the mobile service is immediately rolled out to all the other counties in the west as a matter of priority.I welcome the fact the programme relating to cervical cancer screening will be rolled out nationally.  However, I reiterate that regions such as the west must not be left behind again.  When it comes to rolling out the service, the west would like to take the lead.  This must be borne in mind, particularly when one considers that the region was almost eight years behind the remainder of the country and 12 years behind Northern Ireland in respect of breast cancer screening services.For the new cancer strategy to work and for the centres of excellence to operate in regions as large as the west, it is extremely important to ensure transport services relating to the transfer of patients to and from other areas within particular regions are improved.  There has been severe criticism in the area I represent in recent times because the transport services on offer there are completely inadequate.  If we are serious about making progress, the entire plan must be implemented on an integrated basis.The service at Mayo General Hospital is excellent and will be seen to be so when it is reviewed and examined.  If something is not broken, we should not try to fix it.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I also congratulate Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan on their appointments.  I hope Deputy Reilly has better luck than his predecessor in remaining a Member of the House.Yesterday was a better day as regards the provision of cancer services.  The fact that one person will be in charge of the strategy announced yesterday is welcome and I hope this indicates that the approach being taken is different to those taken previously.  I am particularly conscious of remarks by previous speakers to the effect that there have been many strategies, announcements and new dawns.  However, I hope the appointment of Professor Tom Keane, who possesses a wealth of international expertise, means that matters will be different on this occasion, particularly when the appropriate budgets and structures are put in place.  When we come to review the strategy in the years ahead, I hope the results will prove me right.It is important — this point is relevant as regards the operations of the HSE — that Professor Keane should, from the outset, make himself available to Members of the House to discuss both the implementation and roll-out of the strategy and Deputies' and people's concerns about it.  This strategy will not work if it is forced upon people.  There must be consultation and information must be provided.  With such arrangements in place, the strategy can be successful.I endorse the remarks of my constituency colleague, Deputy Flynn, in respect of BreastCheck.  The fact the west is only now, eight years after the initial roll out, gaining access to this service is a disgrace.  The roll-out of a service such as BreastCheck, which is internationally recognised and meets international standards, should not have been carried out on a pilot basis.  Cancer is not a regional issue, it is a personal matter and all citizens, regardless of where they live, should have the opportunity to beat it.  I hope the roll-out of future cancer screening programmes that are based on international best practice and that have worked in other countries will take place on a national and not a pilot basis.An important part of the strategy in respect of which additional resources should be provided is that relating to research.  In recent times many younger people who do all the right things in terms of lifestyle choices have contracted cancer.  In the past we were given advice on how to live and what to eat and drink and informed that we would enjoy a healthier existence.  However, the number of healthy people contracting cancer in recent times is scary.  The area of research must be expanded and more money must be invested in order to discover what, as highlighted by the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, is triggering the increase in the number of cancer cases.I welcome the fact the programme for Government and my party's manifesto contain a commitment to increase the level of resources and funding available to the hospice movement.  I am familiar with the work done at the Mayo-Roscommon hospice and the people there truly are angels in respect of the support they provide to families experiencing such difficult times.  Our record in the area of palliative care is not good.  However, the expansion outlined in the programme for Government and my party's manifesto and the increases provided to the hospice movement through recent budgets are welcome.I endorse what Deputy Flynn stated in respect of transport.  Responsibility for the transportation of oncology patients must be removed from the existing hospital transport programme.  A separate budget must be set aside for such services in order that the needs of patients who require transport to a centre of excellence or to an existing treatment centre can be met.  The current position under which groups of patients are collected by the same vehicle and obliged to endure a round trip of perhaps 100 or 150 miles before undergoing the rigours of treatment is not acceptable, does not assist in patient recovery and does not promote confidence in the system.I fully endorse Deputy Flynn's comments in respect of Mayo General Hospital.  I have witnessed the work carried out there and during the past ten years members of my family have been obliged to avail of the services provided at the hospital.  There is a fantastic team at Mayo General Hospital which deals with a number of cancer treatment disciplines.  It does so on the basis of the O'Higgins report and its members give huge confidence to families because of their great professionalism and dedication.  The team meets basic quality standards — this is not primarily a geographical issue, although the latter is a factor — as outlined by an international cancer expert and should be given support into the future.  I accept that Mayo and Galway do not often agree on matters.  If, however, we can work with the new centre in Galway to maintain the existing centre at Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar and increase the standards that obtain there, a service will be done not just to Mayo but to the overall cancer strategy.I welcome the opportunity we have been given to debate the roll-out of cancer services.  This has been a significant week, particularly in the context of the announcement made yesterday.  I accept that a great deal of pressure has been placed on Professor Keane with regard to delivering on the strategy.  I am sure everyone in the House wishes him well because we all have an interest in him being successful in his work.  I congratulate the Minister on Professor Keane's appointment.  I look forward to working with her in the roll-out of the new service.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is extremely personal to almost everyone in the House and in society at large.  I congratulate Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan who are, I suppose, now on a tour of Angola.  It is great that Deputy Harney was brave enough to take on the onerous job of Minister for Health and Children.  Equally, they deserve credit for taking on the position of spokespeople.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I am sure they were delighted.  It is a difficult issue.  The delivery of cancer treatment and radiotherapy services has been a priority for this Government and will continue to be so, which I certainly welcome.Along with heart disease, cancer, as Deputy Calleary noted, affects almost everybody and scares people.  Across Dublin, including Dublin South-East, people are being diagnosed and have family members who are being diagnosed with cancer.  It is a huge shock when one receives that diagnosis.Since 1997 and the implementation of the first national cancer strategy, more than €1 billion has been invested in cancer services nationally.  Under the national development plan, this type of continued priority and major investment has continued.  Investment of up to €415 million has been provided for within the new national cancer control strategy to fund the national plan for radiation oncology.Radiotherapy is an integral part of cancer treatment.  It is used for curative and palliative treatment and Government health policy has reflected this.  Only yesterday, eight specialist cancer centres were announced.  They will be located in each of the four HSE areas, will provide treatment services for all forms of cancer and will include radiation oncology services.  Among the new specialist cancer services are two in south Dublin — one in St. Vincent's Hospital and the second in St. James's Hospital.  This is clearly good news for those people in south Dublin and Dublin in general and I very much welcome this development.St. Luke's Hospital was mentioned yesterday in this debate.  It is obviously located in Dublin South-East so I am very aware of the challenges facing it and cancer service delivery.  The primary concern of cancer treatment must be the patient, who must be put first.  My understanding is that treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach.  With many cancers, life-threatening complications can set in which require surgical facilities that are not available at St. Luke's Hospital.  They are available at the main centres and will be available at the facilities in St. James's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital when they come on stream.  Patients' interests are not best served in St. Luke's Hospital.  Perhaps it is not politically correct to say this, but the reality is that we must put the patient first and look past short-term thinking.  In the long term, cancer services from St. Luke's Hospital will be transferred in a planned way where the staff and ethos of the hospital will be transferred.In the short term, urgently needed additional treatment capacity is being introduced at St. Luke's Hospital.  This project is in the build phase with a start date of March 2008.  This capacity will increase St. Luke's Hospital's radiotherapy capacity by 25% and is in addition to the replacement of existing treatment capacity which is reaching the end of its clinical life.  This new replacement capacity represents an investment in excess of €13 million in St. Luke's Hospital.It is a shame that the Opposition is willing to scare people, which is what it is doing.  It is playing on people who are vulnerable, concerned and frightened about what the future holds for them.  It is doing this in the interests of short-term political gain.  That is the reality.  The Opposition knows the facts in respect of——

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Opposition would make the same decision.  It would not send family members to St. Luke's Hospital knowing that better, comprehensive and planned facilities and centres of excellence exist in St. James's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital.  In the future, services will be transferred to St. James's Hospital, which will create an opportunity to provide community and step-down facilities on the grounds of St. Luke's Hospital.I urge the Minister and will demand in time that she give a commitment that St. Luke's Hospital will not be sold off but will instead  be used for community health care.  Improvements and developments are taking place in the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, but there is a huge need for step-down and community care facilities in south Dublin.  It is a core issue that the land and facilities of St. Luke's Hospital are not sold off.  People, with the exception of the Opposition which believes it can score a few political points, generally accept that the transfer of services is in the best interest of patients.I suppose our political views are often shaped by our personal experience.  Like many families around the country who have been visited by cancer, my experience with cancer services has been extremely positive.  I have also met many people who are unhappy with cancer services.  There are gaps and challenges.  Clearly, transportation and the transfer of patients to cancer services are required, but there is no magic wand.  I strongly believe in and support the Minister, not blindly but in a positive and questioning way.  I welcome the continued delivery of services in this country.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate here today and, like others, to congratulate Dr. Deputy James Reilly, if that is not a mouthful, and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  In particular, I congratulate the Minister who is some mighty woman, as the Ceann Comhairle and I both know.  I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan will be, or is, a mighty woman too.  Not to leave out Deputy Reilly, I suppose he will be a mighty man in his day.However, I have very serious questions which require answers.  First, I do not think the public-private partnership, PPP, mechanism is a suitable one for delivering cancer care.  It is unwieldy and inflexible and will not be best suited to the provision of services, which is what is required in this field.  It is fine for buildings, although we saw how the Comptroller and Auditor General had doubts about the five post-primary schools and the cost-effectiveness of PPPs in respect thereof.  It is not a proper mechanism for delivering cancer care.I strongly approve of the centres of excellence.  As Deputy Chris Andrews noted, if somebody was very ill, not necessarily with cancer, one would wish him or her to go to a centre of excellence, irrespective of how near, trusted and valued one's nearby hospital would be.  Why go there if it did not have the necessary technology, expertise and range of specialities?  I strongly agree with the proposal for centres of excellence.Although the Minister does not need my advice in this regard, often the mandarins in the Department of Finance regard rationalisation as an occasion to wield the axe and tell the giver of services that it can cut so much off them.  That is not so because the setting up of the centres of excellence will require massive finance in staffing, technology, the interdisciplinary teams and other necessary services.The second serious question relates to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It appears that this standards body will now deal only with public hospitals and not with private ones.  It is a bit odd that if one is in a private establishment, one does not come under a standard of excellence regime, but that if one is in a public hospital, one does.  I am glad the public hospitals have it, but I cannot see how one is a different patient with a different ailment because one is in a private hospital.  It is a great pity that amendments to HIQA will be needed so soon after its establishment.  Surely this should have been seen for what it was, namely, a grave lack.It again brings into question the issue of co-location.  I was a reluctant convert to it and remain extremely reluctant now because if one is in the private end of a co-location campus, one is not subject to verifying standards, but if one is in the public hospital, one is.  Does one run from one hospital with one's hat on saying "We're HIQA" and go to the other hospital on the adjoining or same campus to be told that one does not come under HIQA?  That is a grave lacuna which must be attended to.I agree with Deputy Calleary on the need for transport services for those receiving cancer care to be separated from transport services for other patients.  A patient attending radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment may be in a run-down state.  Transport to a centre of excellence which the patient may be attending should be tailored to his or her needs.  It should not be given as a form of patronage but as an inherent right within one's care programme.  Professor Tom Keane has been described as a tsar, a term which has bad connotations in historical terms.   However, if he is all-powerful and can get matters resolved, we can go along with whatever title is given to him.When will private hospitals be subject to HIQA's strictures?  I do not believe the public private partnership model is suitable for the provision of any health services.  Co-location raises many issues.  How can services in one hospital on a campus be subject to standards while those in another are not?  It is an odd situation.I wish the Minister for Health and Children well and hope the travails of the Department do not weigh too heavily upon her.  When I was Minister for Health for 12 weeks, I adored learning about the Department but I was aware of its thousand pitfalls, with vested interests waiting to render a Minister impotent.  I do not believe the Minister, Deputy Harney, will be rendered this way.  Deputy Harney is one mighty woman.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Approximately 22,000 cases of cancer are registered each year, from which 7,000 people will die.  I support Deputy O'Rourke's comments on transport provision for cancer patients.  Over 50% of cancer patients are over 65 years of age.  How does a 65-year old patient travel from Mullingar to Dublin or from Letterkenny to Galway for treatment if a specialised transport service is not available?  Concerns have already been expressed on special travel arrangements for patients from the mid-west to Dublin for specialist treatments.  There is a reluctance by the HSE at local level to recognise the need to provide comfortable travel to treatment centres for patients.The 2006 national cancer forum recommended that HIQA establish a national quality framework for cancer control in both the public and private health services.  Despite the serious deficiencies in breast cancer care in Barringtons Hospital, a private Limerick hospital, it was made clear yesterday that the new cancer services supremo will have no remit over cancer services provided exclusively in the private sector.  Up to 50% of the population is covered by private health insurance but the quality of their services will not be supervised.  The Minister must revisit this.In today's The Irish Times, Dr. Muiris Houston states:. . . this means that both Minister for Health Mary Harney and the HSE have sanctioned a reverse two-tier system of care for cancer patients.  While public patients will benefit from the new cancer control strategy, those who choose the private sector will be treated in a system with no explicit quality control mechanisms.The message to patients is clear: despite the push from Government and in particular the Minister to privatise medical services in the Republic, neither the Department of Health nor the HSE are, as yet, willing to assume responsibility for the quality and safety of services provided by the private sector.Will the Minister address the rationale behind exposing private sector patients to less than best practice, as happened at Barringtons Hospital?The health services are in a shambles.  Ward closures have recently occurred in certain hospitals due to cutbacks.  Recently, a family member had to attend the Mid-West Regional Hospital but could not be admitted because no bed was available.Cutbacks have also affected suicide resource officers, responsible for providing suicide-related information and training in communities.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, will be aware of the applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, programme.  It has been cut back because the Department has informed the organisers they cannot continue providing courses in hotels.  If that is the Minister's commitment to suicide prevention, it is a bad start for him.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Our health services, particularly our cancer services, have excellent doctors and nurses, many of whom work under appalling conditions with inadequate equipment.  Many of them see the need for surgical operations to be undertaken but such operations are cancelled due to the pressures imposed on hospitals.  Our cancer services, like the rest of the health service, are essentially dysfunctional.  Survival rates for most cancers are substantially below the EU average.The recent revelations from Barringtons Hospital starkly illustrate these problems and the gross inadequacies of health services administration and the Department of Health and Children.  It is extraordinary that in January 2006, an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Children set out seven specific concerns about cancer services at Barringtons Hospital but for a year and a half the issue was batted between the Department and the HSE while no action was taken.  It was not until August 2007 that we learned of the plight of a 51-year old woman who had been given the all-clear in 2005 but was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer.  I do not accept the Minister's claim that she did not know anything of this until August 2007.  She is responsible for running her Department.  She is responsible for essential health services.  If a difficulty of this nature had arisen in January 2006, why was the Minister not informed?  Why did she not know what was going on within her Department?  Why did she not know that the HSE was refusing to carry out an investigation?  How many women's lives were placed at risk by the extraordinary dereliction of duty of the Minister for Health and Children in dealing with the Barringtons Hospital issue?  The Minister needs to address this issue to a greater degree than she did yesterday.In the area of radiotherapy and cancer services some patients are waiting up to five and six months for essential treatment.  The HSE has been refusing to send public cancer patients awaiting treatment to nine of the country's 26 linear accelerators, which are run by private operators.  This refusal to outsource life-saving radiotherapy is completely illogical in circumstances in which the HSE and the Department of Health and Children are engaging with the private sector with a view to providing co-located hospitals.  It is perverse and indefensible as a matter of policy.Linear accelerators are used to shrink and destroy tumours in cancerous tissues.  Best international practice dictates that cancer patients should not wait more than six weeks for such essential radiotherapy.  A situation whereby patients may have to wait for up to six months is a national disgrace.  Nine machines, which the HSE refuses to use, are based in hospitals where these procedures could be readily provided.  They are only being used in exceptional circumstances.  These are located in the Mater Private Hospital, the Beacon Hospital, St. Vincent's, the Hermitage Clinic in Dublin and in the Galway Clinic.  The Minister should explain why patients' essential treatment is being delayed when facilities are available within the private sector that should be used and could be availed of to protect the health of patients, ensuring they have the treatment they require.I want to refer briefly to the manage cancer committee strategy.  Quite clearly the Minister originally had no intention of announcing it yesterday.  Quite clearly she announced it only in response to the motion tabled by this party and it is clear that the thought process and organisation necessary to implement it has not been applied.  Extraordinarily, the officials in charge of providing for the strategy announced yesterday that they do not know what the budget is or what the costings are.  Ninety days are given for ending cancer services in specific hospitals that up to yesterday had not been consulted and in circumstances where no arrangements had been made.  Quite clearly the timeframe promised yesterday will not apply.I believe in and support the provision of centres of excellence, but it is absolutely crucial that free transport is provided to patients who need to travel long distances.  There has been an utter failure to make an announcement in that regard.  The call by the Irish Cancer Society for that type of service should be met and the Minister should confirm to this House that it will be provided.I welcome the comments made by Deputy O'Rourke this morning.  Many of us share with her the real concerns she expressed about the use of the public private partnership system to provide essential services that should be rolled out by 2010-11 and which we may not see until 2015.  It is an issue that requires further thinking and a reverse course by the Government.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the delivery of services for cancer patients, or rather the non-delivery or late delivery of same if one happens to come from the west or north west.  Of course we all welcome yesterday's announcement of the implementation of the national cancer control programme, with specialist centres of excellence for the delivery of treatment.  However, the difficulty is the timeframe for its delivery.No service already in existence should be withdrawn until a better one is provided.  Yet we heard the Minister say last night that there had been no breast cancer services at Roscommon General Hospital for the last 18 months.  On the basis of that experience, we should not hold our breath regarding the timeframe for these centres of excellence.  Services have already gone at some hospitals around the country, even though the new specialist centres are still some way off.  This should not have happened.It is not acceptable that a cancer patient is less likely to have access to essential services such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy if he or she lives in the west of Ireland because of the variation of access to services regionally.  It is not acceptable that patients are less likely to survive breast, bowel or prostate cancer if they live in the west of Ireland because of the unequal spread of services.  The BreastCheck programme, it was promised, would be available to every woman by the end of 2007.  This will not happen before 2009 and the last areas to have it freely available will be in the west, including Mayo.  Of course we welcome any announcement of mobile units for breast screening in Mayo, as we do the completion of the static BreastCheck unit in Galway.  The waiting time has been too long, however, with the 2005 deadline being extended to 2007 and now it is 2009 for some.The HSE yesterday announced the withdrawal of cancer treatment services in 13 hospitals, including Roscommon and Portiuncula in Ballinasloe.  This announcement has increased fears about the withdrawal of services in other hospitals around the country.  Mayo General Hospital is providing a top quality specialist treatment service which should continue under the proposed new structures as a managed cancer network such as the Mayo Clinic model in Rochester, Minnesota in the United States.  Under this model the Mayo Clinic is the parent centre and surrounding hospitals provide high quality audited oncological practices, working through protocols for patient care decided on at multidisciplinary meetings.  Video conferencing facilities are already on site at Castlebar.Can we be assured that when these specialised cancer centres are up and running there will be well-resourced transport provision for patients who have to travel to such centres, not like the transport services that have been cut to the bone in recent months?  Cancer patients have to fork out hundreds of euro for taxis when going for hospital check-ups after their initial treatment.Are we to be guaranteed that cancer services will not be affected by the range of cutbacks in the health service in general, as we have seen in Sligo and Ennis in recent days and as we have heard about in Galway this morning?  We want such guarantees and assurances from the Minister.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely debate on a motion tabled by the new Fine Gael spokesperson on health, Deputy Reilly.  I congratulate him on his initiative.  As a medical doctor, his experience will be invaluable.  Deputy Reilly has already taken up my invitation to visit Ennis tomorrow, to see at first hand the state of the health services there.  He will be meeting consultants and hospital managers and will be told how a mammography unit located at Ennis General Hospital has been decommissioned.The Minister announced yesterday that services at 13 hospitals throughout the country will be closed.  I hope she is aware that the mammography service at Ennis has been closed since last October and women in County Clare have to travel to Galway and Limerick to be screened.  Geographical factors in west Clare are such that women must travel long distances to Limerick Regional Hospital to avail of the service.  The distance between Kilbaha or Carrigaholt to Limerick Regional Hospital is 80 miles.  There is a taxi service but it costs a great deal of money and there is no bus or other public transport service to take women to the hospital.  We all know one cannot park one's car at the hospital.  If the HSE concentrates all its resources into centres of excellence, people will have to wait a long time to avail of services.  Unfortunately, the Minister does not realise this.I spoke to a woman in Kilbaha two weeks ago when this issue was raised.  She asked why this development was to affect the people of west Clare and why they were to become more disadvantaged than anyone else.  The mayors and Oireachtas Members of County Clare had a meeting with the Minister last week, during which she spoke of mammography services and her intentions regarding the roll-out of BreastCheck.  She said last week she would be in a position within a week or so to announce when BreastCheck services would be available for County Clare.  If she is present to sum up this afternoon, will she make this announcement?The health services in County Clare are in chaos and there has been a continual downgrading thereof.  The county has a growing population of more than 100,000.  In the 1980s there were 122 beds in Ennis General Hospital and there are now 88.  We have lost maternity services and we are now losing our cancer services.  We were told last week the 24 accident and emergency beds in Ennis General Hospital will be a thing of the past when the model the Minister proposes comes into place.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I thank Deputy James Reilly for raising this important issue and congratulate him on his presentation.  With more than 22,000 new cancer patients registered each year and more than 7,000 deaths, proper research, early diagnosis and proper treatment must be our goals regardless of party or politics.  I have no objection to centres of excellence, which may, in the long term, offer the best results, but we cannot remove the services already under pressure until we have proper new ones in place.  We were told by the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, that she would not remove any services until this was achieved.The promises the Minister made two years ago are clearly in shreds and there is no reason we should believe her in respect of the newly proposed strategy and its frightening consequences.  The only part of the so-called strategy about which we are sure is that 13 hospitals treating patients at present will be stopped from doing so without making alternative services available.  Unfortunately, three of these, Louth County Hospital, Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, are in the north-eastern region.One lady had to wait 12 months for a simple breast check although her family history was very serious.  How much longer will others have to wait?  Further to the Minister's announcement, it is clear that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda will not have any service in the longer term, meaning that people from north Monaghan and west Cavan will have to travel 100 miles or more to get a test.  There are no railroads in that area.  The Minister may not be aware that we do not have public transport services.  Clearly, circumstances are even worse in areas such as Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo.  Patients in these counties must depend on Belfast City Hospital.Every day of every week we hear of more cases of cancer.  If I had time, I could list cases in which there was a failure to make a diagnosis on time, thus leading to early death.  It is very easy to claim that results are better in bigger hospitals but, as we know clearly in County Monaghan, the history under this Government is that deaths outside the hospital do not matter because the Minister and HSE can deny responsibility.The Minister promised that the cancer network would be delivered by 2011 but a review of the project has found it is unlikely to be delivered before 2015.  Meanwhile there are huge gaps in the availability of services.  For instance, prostate cancer patients must sometimes wait up to five months for radiotherapy.For many patients who have received successful treatment in the existing hospitals, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and Tallaght Hospital, the winding down of services is a disgrace.  Can we believe the approach of the Government?  Where health is concerned, it is certain that we cannot.  The Minister is a total failure.

Early detection and treatment is vital but it is clear that is not possible everywhere and in respect of everyone.  Promises have been made consistently throughout the past decade but there has been little or no delivery; instead, there have been scares, scandals and slow progress.The suspension of mammography services a month ago in Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, led to great unrest among women and their families who had availed of the services there in recent years.  Some 3,000 mammograms and 2,500 breast ultrasound procedures were carried out since November 2003 in the timeframe under review.  I welcome the review and hope something positive comes from it.   I am not about to add to the alarm but my real concern is that a pattern can evolve for almost four years before it is noticed.  I cannot prejudge the outcome and know from being in contact with the HSE that the review is progressing, but real investment in our services could possibly have prevented this.  I ask the Minister to ensure the review is completed as soon as possible so the service can be reinstated in Portlaoise.  There is no doubt that this, together with the Barringtons Hospital review, has led to what Deputy James Reilly described as a crisis of confidence.  I have spoken to many women who have since questioned or are worried about their results from mammograms and ultrasounds.I welcome the fact that women in my constituency have the opportunity to avail of the BreastCheck service, but I continue to deplore the fact that it is not available throughout the country.  It is unacceptable that it has taken so long.  I hope this Government lives up to its most recent commitment to roll it out nationwide.  The much lauded radiotherapy service plan became nothing more than a football kicked from the HSE to the Department of Health and Children, or between Professor Drumm and the Minister, and, more often than not in recent years, kicked to touch.  The clear lack of consultation between the two has left us with a significant delay and nothing to allay people's concerns.  The target date for roll-out, 2015, will be just short of two decades after Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats coming into power.Many of my colleagues have referred to transport in respect of centres of excellence.  The Members on the other side of the House should note that the public simply does not believe it will be offered the transport necessary to bring patients to centres of excellence.  I support the concept but real proof will have to be provided to demonstrate transport will be available.  We have seen cuts in this area in practically every other area of the health service.  The Government has a duty to ensure that, if centres of excellence are to be built, people will be provided with a means of travelling thereto.I welcome the fact that the cervical screening programme is to be rolled out.  Ireland has one of the highest death rates from cervical cancer.  All expert medical opinion points to the need for early detection if one is to have a good chance of survival.  Sixteen practice nurses have been trained in general practitioners' surgeries throughout the midlands for the past two years but have not been able to provide the service.  In January we learned of a huge backlog.  Is the Minister genuine in her commitment to provide the service nationally next year?  I want her to offer a clear explanation to the House on how the results of treatment will be made known.  Can she guarantee there will be no backlog given that thousands of extra women are entering the service?
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I support my party's Private Members' motion, sponsored by Deputy Reilly, which condemns the delays in the delivery of radiotherapy facilities and calls on the Government to deliver services for cancer patients as a matter of urgency.  As previous speakers mentioned, over 7,000 people die from cancer and approximately 22,000 new cases of cancer are registered each year.  Cancer patients do not have time.  Time is of the essence in the detection and treatment of cancer in so far as it affects the quality of life, suffering or survival of patients.  The failure of Fianna Fáil to deliver reliable cancer services means that hundreds of women face the trauma of having their cases reassessed.  It is crucial in the case of the Barringtons Hospital debacle in Limerick, for example, that all investigations are conducted swiftly in order that meaningful action can be taken to provide reliable services that people can trust.Fianna Fáil continues to fail the people by not recognising the urgent need to develop integrated cancer screening and treatment programmes.  It is imperative for the Government to take real action before more lives are lost to cancer.  The lack of a world class health service, as promised many times by Fianna Fáil, was the biggest issue during the recent general election campaign.  The Minister for Health and Children needs to make the difficult decision to tackle the bloated bureaucracy in the health service, rather than continuing to make sweeping cutbacks at the frontline of the health sector.  The decisions made since Fianna Fáil's return to power have led to a deterioration in the health service.Yesterday's announcement of the establishment of a national cancer control programme was undermined by the lack of an accompanying implementation plan, clear deadlines or costings.  It is disappointing that there will be a reduction in the number of hospitals which provide cancer treatment, from the current 13 to eight.  As an immediate priority, the Minister should ensure the radiotherapy plan she promised in 2005 is delivered, as promised, immediately, not in 2015, which would be a disaster.  The Minister's priority should be to save lives.  She should consult the HSE without delay and deliver treatment services for cancer patients as quickly and efficiently as possible.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I thank all the Deputies for their contributions during the debate.  I congratulate Deputies Reilly and Jan O'Sullivan on their appointment as health spokespersons for their respective parties.  I do not doubt that we will have many discussions across the floor of the Chamber in the coming months.The Government's amendment to the Fine Gael motion is based on a recognition of its achievements in cancer care in recent years and the measures it is taking to develop the national plan for radiation oncology as an integral element of the national cancer control programme.  The amendment acknowledges the need to plan, reform and ensure we have sound evidence based policies for the short and medium term.  When one considers that the number of cancer cases will double in the years to come, it is clear that such policies are especially needed.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, outlined in the House last night the Government's significant cancer control achievements which have been based on a sustained increase in cancer funding.  I would like to allude briefly to some of those achievements.That there are approximately 120,000 survivors of cancer in Ireland is a reflection of the improved systems of cancer diagnosis and more successful forms of cancer treatment now available.  Additional funding of €20.5 million, an increase of 74% on the comparable figure for 2006, has been allocated for cancer control in the current year.  Some 100 additional consultants and 360 additional clinical nurse specialists have been appointed in key areas of cancer care.  In 2006 over 96,000 inpatient and day patients were discharged from hospital following a diagnosis of cancer, which represents an increase of over 75% on the corresponding figure for 1997.  Over 60,000 people were treated for cancer as day cases in 2006, an increase of over 140% on the figure for 1997.  I ask the House to recognise these achievements.  More patients are being treated.  Our health system is detecting more cases of cancer at an early stage.Patients interact with the cancer control system at various stages — they may attend hospital for screening and treatment and avail of supportive or palliative care.  Patients require a seamless transition between the various stages of cancer care.  The basic organisational principle that underpins the HSE's national cancer control programme is that services should be organised and delivered around the patient, regardless of the setting.  As the Minister, Deputy Harney, said last night, we need to achieve equity in the delivery of cancer care, regardless of where and how the patient interacts with the health system.  The development of cancer services is at the heart of the Government's delivery of its cancer control strategy.  It is imperative that the HSE's decisions on the designation of four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres are implemented without delay.  Patients are much more likely to survive if they are treated in specialist centres which provide multidisciplinary care.  The new configuration of services will allow quality assured and patient focused care to be delivered in keeping with international best practice and the highest standards.We need to place a stronger emphasis on health promotion and the prevention and early detection of cancer.  Ancillary care will be maximised to reduce any unnecessary dependence on inpatient care and ensure patients do not have to spend more time than necessary away from home.  Cancer patients will receive multidisciplinary care from cancer specialists in radiology, surgery, medical and radiation oncology, pathology and oncology nursing.  The specialists will work together as an integrated team.  These developments which will reform the delivery of cancer services will be led by the new interim director of cancer control, Professor Tom Keane, whom I congratulate on his appointment yesterday to that new position.A number of Deputies spoke last night about the timescales for implementation of the new programme.  I will set out the implementation targets set by the HSE.  In respect of the breast cancer centres, 60% of the remaining transition will have been completed by the end of 2008, the first full year of the programme, and a target of 90% has been set for the end of 2009, the second full year of the programme.  In respect of cancer centres, it is anticipated that there will be a 50% completion of transition by the end of 2008 which will increase to between 80% and 90% by the end of 2009.  The Minister for Health and Children has asked the medical——

The announcement made by the Minister yesterday represents another failure to be added to the Government's long list of failures.  The Minister has extended her stated timeframes on many occasions — she is incapable of meeting deadlines.  The Government which has been in office for 100 days has given us a clear indication that the health service is in further chaos and crisis.Everybody agrees with the suggestion that it is great to have centres of excellence.  I would like to illustrate the point I am making by mentioning an example in my home county of Galway.  The Government claims that a service which is being taken from Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe will be provided in a centre of excellence at University College Hospital, Galway.  Those who have gone to the hospital in Galway are familiar with the waiting lists there.  I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to note that a patient who returned from abroad last May after being diagnosed with cancer had to wait for two months to receive treatment at the proposed centre of excellence in Galway.  Does the Government intend to compound that problem by transferring what is done at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe to University College Hospital, Galway?The Minister has kicked for touch by making this proposal at a time when there is an embargo on all HSE appointments.  In such circumstances, how can this plan be implemented properly in the manner intended?  We have been told that transitional funding is to be made available for this project.  What does "transitional funding" mean in the context of the current crisis and cutbacks?  It means there is effectively no funding.If funding is diverted from hospitals where this treatment cannot be performed it will be transferred to the centres.  How will that benefit us?  We are told that €500 million is available to implement this scheme over a period and that its effectiveness will be assessed in two years.  This means that, post-election, we are implementing the first stage of the Hanly report.  We are denying Portiuncula Hospital and all similar hospitals.  Other hospitals have lost accident and emergency services and now, gradually and slowly but surely, the Hanly report will be implemented by the back door.  This is regrettable and represents a downgrading of hospitals that can no longer provide these services.  It is too bad if a patient must wait for two months before treatment is provided in one of the centres of excellence.No transport is provided from rural areas to centres of excellence.  The transport service for cancer patients has been discontinued.  What provision is there for those who must travel the furthest distance from this vast area in the west of Ireland from northern Donegal to Clare?  Some may require the service up to three times per week.The implementation of this plan involves a new structure being established over a mountain of other structures under Professor Drumm.  Resources that should be at the coalface are now being hived off to provide paper trails for the policy of implementation.  It will not be a success and the Minister should revisit this matter.  There are no waiting lists for people in Ballinasloe and they must suffer continuous waiting lists under the new scheme.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I congratulate Deputy Reilly on his appointment as Front Bench spokesperson and Deputy Devins on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, welcomed the appointment by the HSE of Professor Tom Keane as interim national cancer control director and the designation by the HSE of eight centres for cancer surgery as a key step in implementing the Government's cancer control strategy.  Galway is one of these centres and is linked to Letterkenny.  This does not say much for the constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim.  The Minister stated:The decision is not about hospitals.  It is not about institutions or budgets.  It is about the best patient care.  All of us involved in health have an ethical obligation to make decisions in the best interests of patients, before local, institutional, political or professional interests.The statement reads well at first glance.  Who could object to making decisions in the interests of patients?  A closer reading raises the question of the ministerial responsibility for the standards of care to be provided in the health service.  Another question is how we should define the best interests of patients.The Minister welcomed the HSE's statement.  The Minister is stating that she is not responsible for the HSE decision on the proposed re-organisation and consolidation of cancer services.  There is a serious risk that national politicians may give away responsibility for all strategic health service decisions and power to medical professionals and the HSE.The delivery of health services requires increasingly complex and specialised medical expertise, skills and knowledge.  I pay tribute to those who work in our health services.  In the main they give a first class service to the citizens of the State.  My concerns relate to the tendency for professional bureaucracies to define problems and solutions from a perspective allied to the professional interests and without regard to the interests of patients and the community.  National politicians have passed the toughest test — the general election.  This House, and through it the Government, is the only fully qualified body to declare what is in the best interests of the citizen.  It is not acceptable for Ministers to seek shelter behind academic gowns, no matter how ornate or distinguished.Regarding the best interests of patients, the fundamental justification of cancer service consolidation seems to be the assertion that a patient's chances of beating cancer rises by up to 20% in specialised centres.  This is a worthy objective but many people may define their best interests as having a local service with an acceptance that the patient's chance of beating cancer would increase by 15% in local centres.  This trade-off is key.I am disappointed that the radiotherapy plan announced by the Minister for Health and Children in 2005 will not be delivered in 2011 as promised but will be delayed until 2015.  This is disappointing in view of the commitment given to the north-west region regarding the roll-out of BreastCheck and radiotherapy services.  I refer also to the significant cutbacks in Sligo, where consultants and nursing staff are being laid off.There are no costings for the centres of excellence.  It sounds very well but there is no substance to the plan.  It is like stating that one will open eight big supermarkets without a plan.  Where is the detail?  People may feel that professors have a certain glow about them but academic gowns are being used to shelter the Government's inefficiencies.  The Minister welcomed the statement of the HSE.  Who is in charge?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I congratulate Deputy Devins on his appointment as Minister of State and Deputy O'Sullivan on her appointment as spokesperson on health.I refer to Deputy Devins's comments on cutbacks at Sligo General Hospital and the manner in which it was done by the HSE.  I castigated him at the time because he should have been in a position to effect some change but I acknowledge that he had concerns.  Perhaps this is because he is a doctor and can see the effect of cutbacks.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, could not see this last night and believes that nurses only take holidays in the summertime.  Hence, we can get rid of all the nurses despite spending much money bringing nurses from the Philippines and India.  It is equally upsetting to hear that none of the Fianna Fáil colleagues of Deputy Devins from the Sligo area appear concerned.The cervical smear cancer screening programme was first mooted in 1999 and the roll-out was to begin the following year.  Eight years later we are no further down the line.  We have another target and another commitment.  I question the commitment in light of outsourcing the reading of these smears to the United States.  If we were intent on delivering this service we would establish the capacity to read the smears in this country.  We have not done so.  What will happen when we have a deluge of smears on the desks of pathologists and histopathologists?  They will be unable to cope.The Minister states that she only heard about the situation at Barringtons Hospital in August but the Department knew about it 19 months previously.  It was passed from the Department to the HSE.  All the lights are on in Hawkins House and in Naas but no one is at home.  Nobody takes responsibility and the Minister does not know about it.  Someone is not doing his or her job and this health service does not have proper leadership.  It is not good enough.  I do not wish to be emotive or to scaremonger but people are dying through lack of service.  People close to me are terminally ill with cancer.The Minister referred to the Medical Council.  The Medical Council has no role in a situation where people are being referred up to Dublin from a private hospital only to be referred back down to Limerick.  This is an issue within the control of hospital administration.  As Deputy O'Rourke pointed out, we do not have proper control or accreditation over private hospitals and this situation highlights this fact.  If this is to be addressed by HIQA then it had better get on the job quickly.The Minister informed the House that the HSE told her that the radiotherapy facilities would be ready in 2010 yet the HSE's chief executive officer, Brendan Drumm, has stated it will not be possible to provide them by 2011 and the date will be 2015.  He stated that the public-private procurement is a difficult way to achieve anything.  His opinion is supported by the Department of Health and Children's hospital planning agency and the National Development Finance Agency.  The Minister ignores all these people and tells this House something completely different to what they have stated publicly.  I do not accept this.I refer to the HSE press release which on careful reading is quite comical in some respects.  It states there will be a transition of cancer services from the current settings and this will occur on a phased basis with patients being reassured that each transfer will be carried out in a planned manner.  It states that services will be withdrawn sequentially from hospitals which do not meet the defined criteria.  However, the next line states that as a result, the HSE has formally requested the following hospitals with low case volumes to no longer provide multidisciplinary symptomatic services with immediate effect.  Where do all these patients go on Monday morning?  Where do the patients at Naas General Hospital, Tullamore General Hospital, St. Columcille’s Hospital and Mallow General Hospital go?

I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on an important motion on the withdrawal of Aer Lingus services between Shannon and London Heathrow.  The importance of the issue for the House, the Government and the people of the mid-west and west is the reason I put the motion before the House for discussion.  I propose to outline the events surrounding the Aer Lingus decision, the rationale given by Aer Lingus for it, the issues that arise on foot of it and the actions taken by Government since it was made.  I will also deal with questions on the 25% Government shareholding and the Aer Lingus initial public offering.At a short meeting with the chairman and chief executive of Aer Lingus on 3 August, I was informed that the company intended to open a hub in Belfast and to transfer the Shannon-Heathrow slots to the new route.  While I conveyed my support for the move to establish the Belfast hub, I expressed concern and disagreement with the decision on the reallocation of the Shannon-Heathrow slots.  I reiterated that view directly and indirectly to the company on my behalf and on behalf of the Taoiseach and Government on several occasions over the following weeks.  At a more formal meeting with the chairman and chief executive on 28 August, I emphasised again the Government's extreme disappointment with their decision.  I set out, in particular, that the decision ran counter to public policy in a number of respects, including the national spatial strategy, regional development and aviation policy, and while it was recognised that Aer Lingus was not an instrument of Government policy, there was an expectation that it would take these wider policy issues into account in making commercial decisions.  I also made the point that Aer Lingus should have engaged more with its customers and wider stakeholders before announcing its decision.The chairman said the decision was taken to establish a new base at Belfast International Airport, following extensive evaluation of growth opportunities throughout Europe.  He said the decision in this case was commercially robust and the company was not proposing to reconsider it.  Aer Lingus has set out the basis for the decision to withdraw its Shannon-Heathrow service with effect from next January as follows.  First, even though the Shannon-Heathrow route was profitable, it underperformed when compared to the routes between Cork-Heathrow and Dublin-Heathrow and the projected Belfast-Heathrow route.  Second, the chairman said that there was a valuable commercial opportunity to be exploited at Belfast and the company could achieve a better return on the utilisation of aircraft and Heathrow slots for the purposes of a Belfast base rather than continuing with the Shannon-Heathrow service.  Third, according to the company, Belfast average fares, load factors and costs are expected to be more attractive than Shannon.  In addition, Belfast is expected to benefit from economies of scale as it grows.

That is certainly the response I got from the company.I investigated the possibility of the State acquiring Heathrow slots to replace the Aer Lingus service.  I was informed that this was not legally possible.  It is not open to the State to acquire slots as the applicable rules allow only for slots to be assigned to airlines.  I also investigated the option of providing funding to assist in acquiring such slots, but again this or any other form of direct subvention of a London Heathrow slot is constrained by the state aid rules.  Once this became clear, it was incumbent on everybody to move on and focus on securing a replacement for the Aer Lingus service as quickly as possible.  That has been my focus and the focus of the Government's and Shannon Airport Authority's efforts since then.

I accept, arising from that decision, that it is legitimate to raise two questions: first, why does the Government retain its 25% stake if it is not prepared to use it to "protect" these slots and, second, why did the Government privatise Aer Lingus and was privatisation wrong?These are legitimate questions.  I will take each in turn.  The State retained a strategic shareholding of over 25% with two key objectives in mind.  First, it provides a major block to a hostile takeover by enabling the State to prevent a compulsory takeover of 100% of the company.  Even if the company was acquired, Aer Lingus would have to continue to be operated as a separate entity.  Members will recall another incident involving Eircom where a company making a takeover bid acquired 80% of the shares.  The other 20% had to be sold to the company.  It was to prevent such a scenario arising that the Government kept the strategic shareholding.  Furthermore, the acquiring entity would not be able to extract the Aer Lingus assets, including slots and cash.  This provides a significant disincentive to hostile takeover attempts.The second strategic advantage of a 25% shareholding is that it enables Government to protect the memorandum and articles of association of the company.  This ability to block special resolutions to change the articles provides a safeguard against any disposal of Heathrow slots: "Disposal of slots relates specifically to the sale of slots and/or the transfer of slots between airlines and does not apply to the reallocation of slot pairs to new or existing bases."  However, the Government's legal advice is that, having regard to the duties of the board of directors pursuant to the Companies Acts and the memorandum and articles of association of Aer Lingus, shareholders do not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters.  In effect, this means that even if the Government on its own, or in combination with other shareholders, called an EGM and voted for the restoration of this link, management of Aer Lingus is not obliged to follow any directions from the shareholders regarding business matters or to obey any resolution regarding such matters.

Without an equity injection, the company would have faced major difficulties in addressing these needs and meeting its social responsibilities while maintaining its competitiveness in a challenging market.Given that it is recognised by the Government that Shannon Airport has a pivotal role in the general economic development of the region, it was decided that the potential impacts of the decision in that context——

This has obvious adverse effects in terms of business travellers and other users from the Shannon region.  However, the senior officials group confirms there should be little impact on connectivity with destinations in the Americas as the best route is as likely to be through one of the US hubs served directly from Shannon.These services are enhanced when one takes into account the link up by Aer Lingus with the US carrier, Jet Blue, which makes possible access to and from Shannon to 50 airports in the US, Mexico and the Caribbean.  This is in addition to the new direct services being provided under the "Open Skies" arrangements.  In the case of European origins/destinations, the analysis found that there is no loss of one-stop connectivity but travel via Heathrow was found in general to be faster.The senior officials group also notes that counties in the wider mid-west region, and along the western seaboard in particular, continue to be well served by air services at the State airports in Shannon and Cork and also at the regional airports in Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Knock.

It noted that the withdrawal of the Aer Lingus Heathrow service, together with the reduction in direct services from North America to Shannon due to "Open Skies", could have an adverse impact on the profile of overseas visitors to the west of Ireland.  It also has implications for high-yield business customers interlining to Shannon via Heathrow from North America, continental Europe and other long-haul markets.The potential loss or displacement of this valuable business to other parts of Ireland is a matter of serious concern.  However, the analysis also took account of Ryanair's intention to increase its capacity from London to Shannon in response to the Aer Lingus withdrawal.  As a consequence of this additional capacity, the consultants considered that the result of these changes will be a small net increase in the level of direct air capacity from London to Shannon.The senior officials group has drawn a number of conclusions in relation to the impact of the withdrawal of the Shannon Heathrow service on the Shannon region.  These conclusions acknowledge both the challenges facing the region but also the opportunities arising through investment and the various regional development initiatives.As a next step the group has proposed the following:Taking account of these factors and the other issues addressed in this report, it is suggested that the relevant Ministers, following consultation with the four Mid-West planning authorities, together with the Mid-West Regional Authority, report back to Government as soon as possible on strategies for unlocking the further development potential of the Limerick-Shannon Gateway and its wider region, in light of the substantial investment planned under the NDP and Transport 21 to create an integrated infrastructure underpinning the region's competitive position.Under the State Airports Act 2004, Shannon Airport Authority has now been mandated to produce a business plan to assess the viability of an independently owned and run airport.  A draft of the Shannon Airport plan is expected to be prepared during October, which will be submitted to the Ministers for Transport and Finance, for their approval.The Shannon Airport Authority has been actively engaging with airlines with a view to securing new services that would redress the reduction in connectivity that will follow from withdrawal of the Aer Lingus service to Heathrow.  I commend the Shannon Airport Authority for its positive response to the present difficulties and wish it well in its efforts to promote the development of new services.The authority has specifically identified airline services to the key European hub airports of London-Heathrow, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt as being of key strategic importance to its ongoing development.  The airport recently published a European hub airport incentive scheme for services to come into operation in 2008, which provides for significant discounts in airport charges and for the possibility of marketing support to be provided by Shannon Airport for new services.While the loss of any passengers can affect airport revenues, the Shannon Airport Authority expects that many current Shannon to Heathrow passengers will be accommodated on other airlines serving the London market and the impact on revenues should be relatively modest.  I look forward to receiving their business plan in the near future.Before I conclude, I want to address some of the more extreme and politically motivated statements made on foot of this Aer Lingus decision——

The date of this statement is October 2006.In April 2007, just before the general election, the Minister for Transport, again in reply to a question from Deputy Finian McGrath, that wonderful Independent Deputy, gave the same response as in October 2006.  Government policy, clearly enunciated right up to the general election, was very clear.  At the heart of the transport policy and at the heart of Shannon Airport was an absolute commitment to retain connectivity between London Heathrow and Shannon.  The commitment was absolutely clear and unambiguous until the decision was made by Aer Lingus.  The Government does not act as it should in exercising its rights.The Minister said the first he heard about this was when the chairman of Aer Lingus spoke to him.  I spoke to Aer Lingus and I was told this matter was discussed by the board of Aer Lingus before the decision was made public.  The Minister has the right to appoint three representatives to the board of Aer Lingus.  So far he has appointed only one representative.  There were two vacant seats at that meeting when the Aer Lingus proposal was being discussed.  Those were the seats the Minister for Transport could and should have filled so the arguments being made by his backbenchers and by us could have been articulated at that board meeting.  Clearly two of the three representatives were absent because the Minister had not bothered to appoint them to that role.Our party is very clear on the issue.  Both former spokespersons on transport, Deputy Olivia Mitchell and Deputy Denis Naughten, made our position clear on the privatisation debate.  Deputy Denis Naughten, in particular, got a commitment from the Minister, Deputy Brennan, that the equivalent of a White Paper would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the privatisation Bill would go through.  Fine Gael, as Deputy Naughten enunciated at that time, said it would not support the Bill unless there was a clear and absolute commitment to the argument specifically and particularly in regard to the slots and connectivity with Heathrow being laid before the Houses.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, signed on but the next Minister, Deputy Cullen, signed off.  Sitting around the Cabinet table when they signed off on that White Paper on the future of Shannon Airport was the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea.  The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, was asleep at the Cabinet table and he allowed the arguments to be put forward.The reality is that we have a Government that has abandoned 350,000 passengers annually between Dublin and Heathrow.  The Minister made much in his speech about the fact that one can still get to London — of course, one can.  Of the 350,000 who travel annually through Heathrow, approximately one third go there for onward connectivity which will not be provided from 1 January because there will be no flights to and from Shannon Airport through Heathrow.  That is a fact and it is incontrovertible.  I am surprised the Minister did not allude more to what we have read in the newspapers about the efforts he is supposed to have made in regard to attracting British Midlands or whoever he can into the area to replace the flights that are being lost.  The truth of the matter is that the Shannon area, Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary, Kerry and so on are significantly and adversely affected by this decision.  There is no articulation of the view of that community or of his backbenchers in what he said today.  He has not insisted, as he has the right to and as the Minister led us to believe he would in his statement, on defending the sale or the transfer of those slots.The Department of Transport was very helpful to me when I asked it about this issue.  The difference between what was contained in the newspaper articles and the truth is that if the slots were sold, leased or transferred by Aer Lingus to whatever other company, the Minister would intervene and call the EGM and direct the company to act in a certain way.  Because Aer Lingus is moving the slots, regardless of where they are going, he has refused to intervene.  Effectively, there was no guarantee in the words of the Minister.  There is no guarantee from this Government that it will——

The nub of the issue is that the Government failed to act.  I have news for the Minister.  I understand an EGM of Aer Lingus will be called.  I spoke with Aer Lingus yesterday and I was told an EGM will be called but not to discuss this specific issue but purchases within the fleet or wherever.  Is the Minister aware of that and, if so, will he represent us and articulate and push the views of the vast majority of people in this House and in the Shannon region, that they want Aer Lingus to look again at the proposed retention of the slots and retention of the service?  Other attractions could be offered — I want to be constructive on this issue.  If all else fails and if Aer Lingus, BMI or another airline will not do it, the Government could declare a public service obligation and advertise for tenders to retain the connectivity between Heathrow and Shannon.  I have a list of more than 225 flights, some of which are inter-country and not just intra-country which the Minister could examine.  If nobody else steps into the breach, the Minister has a duty of care to the people of the mid-west to retain the onward connectivity provided by the link between Heathrow and Shannon Airport.  A good argument can be made in the case of the west of Ireland for the provision of effective connectivity to the wider world via European hubs, which is entirely in line with the key aims of a PSO service based on regional economic and social development.  The Government has an alternative.  The Minister has choices in filling the board, in addressing an EGM and, if all else fails, to declare a public service obligation.  Many constructive acts can be carried that can, will and do support the views of the people, particularly the business community in that area.This is a critical issue based on the fundamental truth that we cannot trust the Government on transport.  We cannot believe it in the answers it gave no more than three or four months ago.  They mean nothing when the Minister sits around the Cabinet table with his colleagues one of whom, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, is clearly asleep when it comes to his constituency.  We challenge all the Government backbenchers, Ministers and Ministers of State from the region not just to vote for our amendment but also to walk through the lobbies and stand up and vote for the people of the area, the Aer Lingus workers, Shannon Airport and the whole mid-west.

The Taoiseach had been last seen leaving the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway races heading south.  However, just like Nero, he chose to sit idly by while the economy of the west of Ireland faced one of its greatest challenges.  Again today the Taoiseach is not here as he is meeting his constituents at the National Ploughing Championships.  When the Minister finally appeared he showed no understanding of the seriousness of the situation when he claimed that the key business and tourism leaders in the region were exaggerating.  He said that connectivity to Heathrow was not "the be all and end all" for Shannon.  For the Minister for Transport to say that the region was exaggerating and claim that we have been telling blatant lies this morning is beyond belief.Does the Minister believe that Element Six is exaggerating considering that it purchases 2,000 seats per annum and employs 630 people?  Avocent Ireland purchases 1,000 seats and employs 160 people.  Olympus Ireland purchases 600 seats — just to name a few.  Would the Minister claim the Doonbeg Golf Club was exaggerating when it put a €50 million extension on hold or Dromoland Castle was exaggerating when it was forced to put a €25 million investment on hold?

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	224	They were apparently exaggerating in the Minister's eyes and perhaps he thinks they were telling blatant lies as well.  Aer Lingus claims the decision was taken on a commercial basis.  The Minister is a major shareholder.  Dermot Mannion said that the Belfast route would be profitable from the start.  However, Dermot Mannion also said that the Dublin to Dubai route would be profitable and now we hear that this service is to terminate.  Already we hear that pre-bookings for the Belfast routes show they have only sold 175 seats for the month of January out of Belfast, while the competitor, Ryanair, has sold 1,100 out of Belfast for the same period.The Aer Lingus Shannon to Heathrow route is a different story.  A profitable route carrying 350,000 passengers with a 75% load factor is considered remarkable.  After weeks of huffing and puffing, in a belated announcement, the Minister stated that he realised that connectivity from Shannon to Heathrow was essential.  This admission was like the conversion of St. Paul on the road to Damascus.  Rumour has it that a new airline will start to operate the route as soon as possible.  This is not true and in any event, a quick short-term fix is not the answer.  The best way to ensure long-term connectivity to the region is for Aer Lingus to continue to serve the Shannon to Heathrow route.The Minister promised to deliver a transition period for Shannon Airport after the introduction of open skies but failed to deliver.  He promised that he had sought and received guarantees from Aer Lingus of a minimum 400,000 transatlantic passengers but failed to deliver.  He promised that Shannon would share in the success of 22 new US destinations but failed to deliver.  Above all else he promised a tourism and economic plan for the region but failed to deliver.I ask Ministers and Government Deputies to join us.  We have witnessed a great coming together of the entire west of Ireland over the last few weeks to fight this decision.  It is now time for the west of Ireland to unite in this House.  It is very simple, if they want to have the Aer Lingus decision to end the Shannon to Heathrow service reversed then they must join my colleagues and me, and vote with their feet.  The Government spent enough money on consultants to ensure that the commitments given in the articles of association were not open to legal interpretation.  Actions speak louder than words.  Hiding behind legal advice as outlined in a reply to a parliamentary question I received this morning will not wash.As I look across the floor I see Bertie's team.  We are watching them and they will be remembered by the people of the west and mid-west for their actions here today.  The choice is theirs.  They should join us and save the west of Ireland.

I notice that my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, is absent, which is a pity.  He was elected primarily to represent the people of Limerick East and he is not here.  He was correct when he said on the "Morning Ireland" radio programme that the Minister for Transport and the Marine was taking his own advice.  Clearly the speech by the Minister for Transport and the Marine contains absolutely nothing.  Every body in the mid-west and west has condemned this decision.  Local authority members including many from the Minister's party have condemned it, as have the Catholic and Protestant bishops in the region and various business groups.  We have the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance.  We have 400 employees of Aer Lingus, who have been completely overlooked by the Government.  If those 400 employees were in the Minister's constituency in Meath West, I do not believe he would have the attitude he has shown today.The regional planning guidelines indicate that 36,000 people in jobs in the region are directly or indirectly affected by Shannon Airport.  There is €35 billion invested from US companies in the region.  The American Chamber of Commerce states there are 129 US companies employing 20,000 people and that it will be a disaster if Shannon to Heathrow connectivity ceases.  The Atlantic Connectivity Alliance, a business group, states that passengers from 200 destinations arrive through Heathrow and we will lose connection with 46 cities if the Shannon to Heathrow connection ceases.  Six new hotels have been built in my constituency, Limerick East, in the past year, providing 1,000 extra beds.  They were built on the basis of certain infrastructure being in place, in particular, the Shannon to Heathrow connection.The Government's motion is a sham.  It is an insult to the people of the mid-west and the west.  It makes no reference to the only thing that could effect a change, namely, calling an EGM.  If the Government is so disappointed about the decision of Aer Lingus, if it is so interested in balanced regional development, why did it not move during the last several weeks and call for such an EGM?  What has happened highlights the neglect of the region.  There is no reference to Shannon Airport in the national development plan.  There is no mention of a Shannon to Limerick rail link.  Talk of ground transport is a joke.  The Government downgraded Shannon development in the past two years under the current Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin.  On 4 July subsequent to the election of the new Dáil, I raised on the Adjournment the issue of the tourism and economic development plan to which my colleague, Deputy Pat Breen, also referred.  The Minister did not attend the debate.  That plan was brought in by the Minister's predecessor who commissioned the plan and launched it amid fanfare in July 2006, but there is still no funding in place.  I was informed during the Adjournment debate that it would be provided in a couple of weeks.  Three months later there is no sign of it.  The Minister must put that funding in place.We have heard about this poor decision by Aer Lingus and about its profitability.  Why did Dermot Mannion not go to Shannon Airport Authority and engage with the unions to seek renegotiation to make it profitable?  The Minister neglected to say that more than two thirds of the shareholders in Aer Lingus were against the company's decision.  Deputy Peter Power was the first Deputy to come out in support of Ryanair's call for an EGM.  On "Morning Ireland" he stated that as a TD for Limerick and a representative of the mid-west he would encourage the Government to support resolutions before the EGM to reverse the decision.  I call on Deputy Power to join with us today and make this happen.  It is a shame that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, is not here today.  He should be present.  He spoke ad nauseam about how he represents the people of the mid-west and Limerick East.  He supported the call for an EGM.  He even stated that if this decision went through it would set a precedent for removing the Heathrow slots from Cork and Dublin.  It is a disgrace that the only Cabinet Minister based in the mid-west is not here today.I ask Deputy Power and his colleagues in the west and mid-west to vote with us today.  They cannot speak out of both sides of their mouths.  They are either for the mid-west and its survival or they are against it.  Today's vote will show which.

Amendment No. 2 states:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"—conscious of the very serious implications for employment, business and tourism in the mid west and western regions of the decision of Aer Lingus to end its Shannon to Heathrow air service;—noting the strong opposition to the move expressed by employers, trade unions and public representatives;—recalling the commitments the Government gave prior to privatisation of Aer Lingus that it would take adequate steps to protect the state's key strategic interests and that in particular it would ensure sufficient services between the state airports and Heathrow to allow passengers connect throughout the course of the day with key long haul destination flights to and from Heathrow';—calls on Aer Lingus to reverse its decision; and—further calls on the Government to honour the commitments it gave to the Dáil and the public prior to privatisation of Aer Lingus and to take all appropriate steps to ensure that the Shannon-Heathrow Aer Lingus service is maintained, including, if necessary, the convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the company."This is the first opportunity we have had to address this issue on the floor of the Dáil.  I want, first, to pay tribute to all of the people from the west and the mid-west who came here yesterday to show their support for the Opposition and their clear determination to have a reversal of this decision, and to those who came again today and are in the Visitors Gallery.In regard to the Minister's speech, the Government's extreme disappointment is of no use to those people.  I have never heard such a mealy-mouthed, hypocritical, hand-wringing abdication of responsibility.  The buck stops with the Minister.  It is inconceivable that the Minister could have held a 25% share in the company and said what he said both when the announcement was made and in the House today.  I speak also to the Deputies sitting behind the Minister and those who are not present.  Those Deputies from the mid-west and the west fulminated on the airwaves.  They fell over each other to get to the microphones and the representatives of the press who, incidentally, are not here today.  They were lion-hearted leaders of their communities six weeks ago.  I wonder what they will do today.Where is my colleague the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, who could not wait to get back from his holidays to attack Dermot Mannion as a latter-day Cromwell, who could not wait to run down the steps here last night to defend his Taoiseach and his Government?  Why is he not here standing up for his people?

These people stood up in the west and the mid-west as proud as punch to represent their people.  Today they stand behind the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  This is not acceptable.  Government exists to do its duty.I quote a former distinguished Member of this House, founder of the Progressive Democrats Party, Desmond O'Malley, who stated in a letter to The Irish Times:I spent a good part of my political career seeking to encourage inward manufacturing investment.  I had some success. . . .The termination of services from Shannon to Heathrow will have its greatest effect in making it much more difficult to attract that kind of investment in the future.  Apart from the loss of existing jobs, thousands of jobs that might have been created will not materialise.  It will be impossible to quantify what might have happened.  As a result, those who cause this situation will claim that they are not toblame.  . . .The Minister for Transport, among others, is espousing a version of company law with which I am not familiar.  He seems to think that management is supreme, to the exclusion of all others.  The Companies Acts envisage the board of directors as responsible for the actions of a company.  The board in turn is answerable to the shareholders.  The shareholders have the ultimate sanction of dismissing the board if they disagree with the company's policy.Why retain a blocking minority if it is not going to be used to stop the very sort of thing that we were told it was kept for in the first place?  President Sarkozy retained for the French state a blocking minority of shares in the recent merger of Suez and Gaz de France.  Does anyone think he would refuse to use it in a similar situation to this?I could not put it any better than the founder of the Progressive Democrats Party.  I wonder how that party intends to vote today.We were told that the Minister could use the word "lie" in the House.  Was the statement of a former Minister a lie — I will not name the former Minister because I would not be allowed to use the word "lie" — when he stated that Heathrow Airport serves a unique role in ensuring connectivity to and from Ireland; that this connectivity is fundamental both to provide connections to and from Dublin as well as to and from the regions; and, that this is the reason for the mechanism providing for a possible consideration of slot disposals by extraordinary general meeting as set out in the articles of association of Aer Lingus Group plc.?  The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said in the Dáil that the Government would retain a minimum stake of 25.1% in the company to protect the State's key strategic interests and to protect sufficient services between State airports and Heathrow to allow passengers connect through the course of the day with key long-haul destination flights to and from Heathrow.  We want no less than that.  We do not want any other kites flown regarding other airlines or other possibilities.  We want to maintain the Shannon to Heathrow connection that the Government promised when it was privatising the airline.  Assurances were given at that time that this was the reason a minimum stake of 25.1% was being retained by the State.  The Government has reneged on that promise.The Labour Party rightly opposed the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  The chickens have come home to roost in that regard.  Within less than a week of the announcement during the bank holiday weekend, the Labour Party tabled a motion in the Dáil on 13 August calling for the reversal of the decision and for the Government to take whatever action was necessary.  Our leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, went to Shannon and met various groups shortly after taking up his position.  A point made by him at that time was that if that decision had been made before the election, we could have been quite sure it would have been reversed.  He is absolutely correct.  Now they are hiding behind Deputy Dempsey as Minister.  I hope the electorate in Clare, Limerick and other areas in the mid-west will learn a lesson from this and will not vote in large numbers for these people given what they have done.I appeal to Members to support us and to collectively stand for the people of their regions to ensure connectivity is maintained.  I will name those involved: Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea; Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív; Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Killeen; Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hoctor; Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt; and, Deputies Peter Power, Dooley, Collins, Cregan, Grealish, Fahey, Treacy, Michael McGrath, Mansergh, Lowry, McEllistrim and Healy-Rae.  Their collective voice could have been used to persuade the Government to ensure the decision was reversed.  They did not do so.

These are people who do not normally stick their heads above the parapet on these issues.  They did so because they are genuinely concerned about job losses, their companies and the prosperity of the region.  I will quote what one of them had to say: "This is not an inconvenience but a critical business and prosperity issue for the west and mid-west".  It is not as the Minister says some form of exaggeration.  This is a crucial issue for the strength of our region.  It is an issue on which the Deputies opposite could have made a difference had they been willing to stand with us and to tell the Government they believed in what they said.  Some of those Deputies are here today.  Perhaps we will hear from some of them later what it is they propose to do.A fundamental issue of political credibility arises when Deputies express support for an issue in their own region and do not support it in this Chamber.  These people are denying their responsibility as public representatives for their regions.  It is vital to people in the west and mid-west that this decision is reversed.  I urge the Government to use its 25.4% shareholding at the proposed AGM or to convene an EGM, as the former Minister indicated it would, to ensure this decision is reversed.  If it does not do so, Members will not be able to hold their heads high and say they care about the west and mid-west.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I am delighted to have this opportunity, as Labour Party spokesperson on transport, to speak on this important motion and to stand with my colleagues from the west and mid-west, Deputies O'Sullivan and Higgins, who have led the campaign to protect Shannon Airport's Heathrow slots.The Labour Party's position on this matter is clear and unequivocal: the Government as a 25.4% shareholder must convene an extraordinary general meeting to ensure Shannon Airport and the mid-west region does not lose the vital Heathrow slots which provide a gateway to the rest of the world for travellers and business people.  Deputy O'Sullivan has rightly described the Heathrow slots as an essential part of Shannon Airport's connectivity with 350,000 people using the route annually and approximately 30% of passengers on the Shannon-Heathrow route connecting to further destinations worldwide.Fianna Fáil Ministers have acknowledged the overwhelming importance of the Shannon-Heathrow slots to the region's connectivity and to job creation and industrial development in the mid-west.  The Minister described as critical the maintenance of the Shannon Airport-Heathrow link.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, stated that the capacity to attract additional jobs could be hampered by this decision.  There is no fudging on this issue.  This decision has a real impact.  However, even with the recognition at the highest Government level that this important region's global connectivity and attractiveness for job creation will be critically affected, the Fianna Fáil-Green Party-Progressive Democrats Government is prepared to stand by and let this happen.Nobody would disagree with the anodyne sentiments expressed in the Government motion but is it not pathetic for the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, and his colleagues to ask Dáil Éireann to share the Government's deep disappointment at the Aer Lingus decision to end the Shannon-Heathrow service?  After all, as a 25.4% shareholder, this Government is in a position to act to maintain this link.  The Labour Party and I strongly believe that the decision to remove the Shannon-Heathrow slots is wrong and is bad for the mid-west, Ireland and our strategic national interests.  The Minister should urgently call an EGM or take advantage of the proposed AGM to discuss this matter.A key part of the Government's hypocrisy in pushing for the privatisation of a key State asset such as Aer Lingus is its ability to now state that decisions made by the company have nothing to do with it and that there is little it can do to reverse these decisions.  However, did the Government not know all along and not care about the devastating impact on the mid-west or the possible knock-on effects for Heathrow slots allocated for other Irish airports including Cork and Dublin?It is clear that the expansion project which included the re-allocation of the Heathrow slots was part of the business plan prepared for the flotation of Aer Lingus.  The proposal to eliminate the Shannon-Heathrow slots and the development of a Heathrow connection for Belfast International Airport was clearly brought forward by the chief executive, Dermot Mannion, and his management team.  At a succession of board meetings, the business plan for the flotation and the Belfast to Heathrow connection were strongly endorsed.  Surely this implies the unanimous support of the board of Aer Lingus including the Government's representative, Mr. Francis Hackett.It is scarcely credible that a profound business decision such as the removal of the Heathrow slots from Shannon could have been developed without the approval of the board under any model of good corporate governance.  Those of us who have experience as directors of companies will know this is the case.  The question then arises as to when the Minister and his colleagues first became aware of this plan.  The question also arises as to how the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, following his statement on the loss of the slots for Shannon can remain in Government given the doctrine of collective Cabinet responsibility.In 2006, the Labour Party transport spokesperson, Deputy Shortall, provided this House with a detailed and unambiguous critique of the Government's privatisation plans and set out the obvious threat to Ireland's regional and national strategic interests as a result of the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  The Labour Party ploughed a very lonely furrow in that privatisation debate.  We stood alone with the support of only a few Independents.  We received no support from this side of the House except in the final vote.  The Labour Party foresaw the Ryanair elephant coming down the tracks and foresaw what would happen to Shannon, Cork and Dublin.The value of the Heathrow slots to our island nation and the potential danger to these slots if Aer Lingus was privatised was one of the major issues flagged by the Labour Party to the Taoiseach and former Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, during debates on privatisation.  Unfortunately, those clear sighted warnings from Deputy Shortall and others were ignored and now appear to be coming to pass just a few short months following the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  In preparing for the IPO the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government paid a staggering €30 million for the advice of consultants and outside advisers.  However, none of those advisers appears to have foreseen the problems which would arise within days in terms of the Ryanair takeover bid and the strategic regional interests of this country.The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, told this House that arrangements had been made to safeguard the Heathrow slots by building them into the memorandum and articles of association.  He went on at length about this, including in a debate which I had with him about the 30.4% and 25.4% shareholdings.  He had the cheek to say in retrospect that he considered that four London-Heathrow services to and from Cork and four summer season and three winter season services to and from Shannon would each be critical to ensuring connectivity to those airports because that is the minimum necessary to ensure a spread of flights throughout the day.Why are the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister for Finance and the rest of their colleagues not demanding that an extraordinary general meeting be called?  We have heard some slíbhín-type semantic manoeuvrings from various Ministers and Deputies that this is a mere slot transfer rather than a slot disposal and for this reason we cannot use the powers of the extraordinary general meeting.  However, that is just a low and despicable attempt to avoid dealing with the Government's responsibility on the matter and its responsibility to the citizens of Shannon and the mid-west.  Apart from the analysis provided by Deputy Shortall and the Labour Party on the effects of privatisation, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport held protracted and comprehensive hearings on the proposed sale of Aer Lingus in May 2006.  Repeated warnings issued about what would happen.  For example, Dr. Aisling Reynolds-Feighan stated: "Aer Lingus is small and vulnerable to takeover in the event of it being privatised in a substantial fashion...It is vital the Government holds on to a significant shareholding to control its destiny in terms of air access to the country...If this requires periodic Government investment and is necessary to protect our strategic interests, so be it; that is what we must do".  Deputies Dooley and Peter Power served on that committee and they agreed the committee's report, which I am quoting.  Is it not arrant hypocrisy that Members can turn up today and vote against a report they agreed?

Recent media reports in the UK state phase 1 of terminal 5 is set to come on stream in April 2008 with phase 2 following a few years later.  The airport's capacity will, therefore, increase.  Heathrow provides a vital aviation artery for Irish travellers and business people to connect to destinations all over the world.  It is clear from the map presented by representatives of the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance yesterday afternoon that practically every region on the planet is served by the airport.  For example, it caters for 85% of the UK's long haul flights.  It is obvious why the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance and representatives of the Aer Lingus Shannon workforce who met Labour Parliamentary Party members yesterday are desperate to retain that link.The famous Heathrow Airport slots are of enormous value to Ireland and they are the jewel in the crown of our aviation industry.  It is ominous for both Aer Lingus and the country that the Government, as the company's major shareholder, is refusing to protect Shannon Airport.  If it is Shannon Airport today, which airport will it be tomorrow?  For example, it might be in the company's interest to transfer the slots to connect to Malaga, given the number of flights between London and Malaga, or to transfer them to long haul as a privatised commercial company.I am in a unique position to fully understand the dilemma of Government Deputies from the west and mid-west.  In the summer of 1994, there was a massive struggle to restructure Aer Lingus, which involved significant upheaval for the company's staff and their families.  Fine Gael in Opposition tabled a motion that requested the immediate full financial support for the national airline.  As soon as I read the motion at a finance committee meeting, I realised I could not oppose it, even though my party was in Government with Fianna Fáil.  In so doing, I had to vote against the party and our great inspiring leader, Dick Spring.  Later that evening, after a great deal of thought, the famous Northside Six, of whom I was one, walked down the Opposition gangway.  I was behind my great north Dublin colleague, former Deputy, Sean Ryan, and I supported the Opposition's motion and suffered all the consequences.  The next day all my gear was out in the front hall.

I will resist the temptation to remind him  and others of the wonderful rhetoric of Opposition Members who did the exact opposite when they were in Government.  However, it is more important to acknowledge, in voting on such a motion, the impact on policy and that the difficulties that will beset the business and hotel and tourism community and the airport workers will not be moved forward one whit by such political posturing.

I know what I am talking about it.I would like to set out the position and deal with the realities.  The Minister has set out the legal position and nobody has put up an argument to undermine that.  However, important issues are outstanding.  The briefings of the chief executive officer of Aer Lingus regarding industrial relations in the company set the background for the decision and raise serious issues that cannot be avoided and must be grappled with in the future.  Depending on how that plays out, major issues must be addressed.  The question of what we believed the blocking minority shareholding would achieve must be dealt with in the medium term by those who gave legal and other advice.  However, today it does not advance the case to restore connectivity.I want to concentrate on how to address that.  Representatives of Aer Lingus management say it has made a commercial decision and even if they are not open to questioning on the basis of the ownership of a share of an airline, they are open to questioning on this commercial decision.  They have laid out a number of factors in private and public briefings, one of which is airport charges.  That difficulty and the ill-feeling over Ryanair's deal with Shannon Airport is addressed in the offer set out by the airport authority at Shannon and, therefore, one of the legs underpinning the company's commercial decision is no more.  They also say their costs in Shannon are 50% higher than in Dublin or elsewhere.  A process is provided under social partnership involving the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission to address such issues.  Aer Lingus managers did not take this route but they must do so quickly.  They claim they can achieve better load factors and fares in Belfast.  The evidence of bookings to date suggests strongly that will not be the case and if this transpires to be so, Aer Lingus management has a case to answer on commercial grounds.  They must address this on behalf of various shareholders, including the Government.  They cite reducing loads in Shannon Airport and that was borne out by the request by British Midlands for support from the business community.  Perhaps the business community could do something to indicate its support for a service at Shannon Airport.I acknowledge the issues raised by the Minister in his contribution about acquiring additional slots and the legal difficulties involved but I ask him to examine them further because they can be so examined.  Aer Lingus management must address its treatment of 350,000 passengers.  No more than any other company, it has a corporate responsibility for which it is answerable and if it does not do so, it must be brought to account for it.  Enormous damage had been done to the company's brand through the plan management has set out.As I have stated repeatedly when addressing this matter, connectivity is important and it can be achieved ideally by having Aer Lingus acknowledge it has made a mistaken decision——

I condemn in the strongest possible way the actions of Aer Lingus to terminate the Shannon-Heathrow service.  The decision has serious implications and it will have a significant impact on tourism, business and other commercial activity in the region.  It is important to question the commercial sense of this decision when one considers that it is a profitable route with in excess of 350,000 passengers using it.I also question the clandestine nature of the way Aer Lingus announced the decision.  That approach has no place in today's partnership approach to doing business.  There is certainly a lack of consultation with the workers, the airport authorities and the Government.The Aer Lingus management decision has damaged extensively the brand Aer Lingus.  It has damaged the region through adverse publicity, both nationally and internationally.  The commercial reality Aer Lingus management has attempted to use is not credible.  Aer Lingus has not made any effort to address profitability at Shannon or to address what they have said is a very significant cost base.It beggars belief why Aer Lingus ended the third-party handling at the airport in recent times.  It was a very fruitful source of extra income.  Aer Lingus made no effort to grow the business out of the airport in recent years and has virtually ignored the airport.  It has announced no new routes.  The management of Aer Lingus has a commercial responsibility to sweat the asset that is Shannon Airport before it takes the decision to move to another base.Aer Lingus workers have yet again been ignored by the management of Aer Lingus.  These people have compromised and have demonstrated the capacity to compromise in the past through the various restructuring plans, including the Cahill plan.  Aer Lingus has clearly made a bad commercial decision, one which will ultimately prove to be a rock on which the management perishes.This debate is about connectivity for the west and mid-west.  We are all well aware that connectivity is vital for the successful business operations in the region and it is critical for access to global markets and to sustain the level of wealth creation that has taken place throughout the mid-west.  It should allow companies to progress along their growth cycle.Business leaders have spoken out in a very clear and unambiguous way, particularly those from the sectors most affected.  They have spoken of the difficulty it will create for them in getting future investment.  Development agencies have described difficulties in getting new greenfield investment and more importantly, many of the people in the companies who are trying to progress from being a manufacturing to a more highly skilled based workforce have indicated it will pose significant difficulties for them.Aer Lingus has followed an agenda often associated with east-coast thinking, where the notion is of one central hub in Ireland with other airports acting on a spoke off it.  That is unacceptable to any of us, especially those of us representing the west or mid-west.  We have the second-largest concentration of industry outside Dublin and we need direct access through Heathrow to international destinations.I welcome the clear statement in today's motion, particularly that the Government supports the connectivity between Shannon and London-Heathrow.  I know this was affirmed through a statement from the Cabinet meeting of 29 August, which endorsed this commitment.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The protests are being led by key business people in the mid-west area.  They are not whingers.  They provide much-needed employment and the Shannon Heathrow slots provide a connectivity that holds together business in County Clare and other counties throughout the mid-west and western seaboard.  Heathrow is the west's biggest gateway to the global economy as it provides access to 200 destinations throughout the world.Taking the Shannon Heathrow slots away will remove one-stop access to 46 destinations.  Companies affected include Element Six, formerly known as De Beers, which takes up 2,200 seats on the Shannon-Heathrow route every year, with 1,000 for customers and 1,200 for staff.  This company is committed to Shannon.  It has made a major contribution to the mid-west economy over the past 40 years, since it began with its manufacturing facility.  It has progressed to providing high-end jobs in IT, finance and other activities.That company did not have to locate in Shannon.  It could have been positioned other than in Ireland but because of the available connectivity, it decided to stay in Shannon.  The company made it through the 1970s and 1980s but in 2007 there are many jobs at risk in the company.  An announcement today indicates that 178 jobs in Tyco in Shannon are at risk.  We may have lost another manufacturing company.  The decision by Aer Lingus coupled with the Government's reluctance to intervene has caused this devastation.The decision will also affect tourism.  I recently spoke to John Madden, the managing director of the Temple Gate Hotel.  He knows a group of golfers who come to Ireland on a yearly basis, spending in the region of €150,000.  When the Aer Lingus decision was made he was told by phone that the group would go to Spain or France instead because the connectivity was no longer there.  That is just one example of how tourism is being affected.Prior to the IPO, the Heathrow services to Dublin, Cork, and Shannon were specifically identified as being of key strategic importance.  This position was stated and restated by the Government and on the Aer Lingus website.  The Government stated it would intervene if these slots were threatened.  Where is this intervention and where is the extraordinary general meeting?  Why has the Government deliberately misled the people?Possibly the most disappointing aspect of this debacle is the misinformation, spin and economy with the truth on the part of this Government.  When the Aer Lingus CEO was asked if the Government knew in advance of this decision, his answer was silence.  The Government clearly knew of this decision well in advance.I appeal to those thinking of voting with the Government to support our amendment.  They have a chance to save these slots which will provide connectivity to Shannon.  I appeal to those Deputies to join with us to change the decision.  It is in their hands.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I congratulate the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance on their work and the research and information on this being provided not only to public representatives but to the public in general.  With the exception of the excellent chairman who is a member of the Minister's party and doing outstanding work to persuade him to change his view on this matter, those involved have no involvement in politics.I wish to deal with the issue of tourism because it is important to my constituency.  I live near Adare which depends heavily on tourism and has three excellent hotels, namely, the Dunraven Arms, Adare Manor Hotel and Fitzgerald's Woodland House Hotel.  Rathkeale House Hotel is also situated nearby.  These hotels will be severely affected by the Aer Lingus decision which the Minister refused to challenge.  That decision will have a major impact on the tourism product in the county and, in particular, west Limerick.According to Tourism Ireland, 27% of North American visitors to Ireland arrive by air from the United Kingdom.  This figure includes those who come via London Heathrow.  The United Kingdom, with London Heathrow, is a primary hub and remains an important entry point for US visitors to Ireland.  Hoteliers in the west have prepared initial estimates which indicate that there would be a loss of €8.5 million in revenue if the decision to end the London Heathrow-Shannon connection proceeds.  An estimated 233 jobs would also be lost at west of Ireland hotels.  The management at Dromoland Castle indicated yesterday that it would definitely be laying people off when this connection was severed.Capital investment projects worth a total of €113.5 million are on hold in the tourism sector as a result of uncertainty regarding flights to Heathrow.  These projects have the potential to lead to the creation of 379 jobs in the west and mid-west but these will be lost if Aer Lingus proceeds with its plans.  There will be a reduction of up to 10% in the number of North American visitors to the Shannon region as a result of the discontinuation of the Shannon-Heathrow air service.Aughinish Alumina in my constituency avails of 500 round trips through Heathrow Airport, of which a total of 150 relate to employee usage, while the other 350 are designated for inward visits from customers and headquarters personnel.  These flights are routed into Shannon via Heathrow.  The Aughinish-Askeaton site is designated for demonstration purposes and headquarters operate from it.  A centre of excellence is also located at the site.  Just two weeks ago, 12 bankers from the United Kingdom flew into the area via Heathrow.  In the first week in September 25 international journalists were flown in via the same airport.  Heathrow access is, therefore, critical to Aughinish Alumina's demonstration site activities.  I remind the Minister that there are 600 employees on site and that, in total, Aughinish Alumina employs in the region of 1,000 people.  Neither he nor the Government were concerned with regard to the loss of almost 1,000 jobs at Castlemahon or Kantoher.  I ask him to be concerned about the jobs that are going to be lost in the tourism and business sectors in the constituency of Limerick West.Deputies Collins and Cregan have an opportunity to express themselves and inform their colleagues that they must change their minds on this matter.  Deputy Collins spoke on radio and television and vigorously promoted what we are trying to do.  We ask him to do so again.The statement that the Government has a commitment to and an interest in the mid-west and the west is just a blatant lie.

It is unfortunate that additional time could not be allocated for this debate.  However, in the brief time available, I wish to make a number of points.Rarely, if ever, has a decision by a private company attracted such sustained public criticism from the Government, public bodies, politicians from all parties and, most importantly, the public.  The total opposition to this decision was evident yesterday in the form of the large turnout of workers from the area, people who are at the coalface and rightly concerned about it.  History will show this to be a flawed decision by a flawed management at Aer Lingus.  Far from improving its situation, this flawed decision has done long-term damage to the airline, for which management must bear responsibility.  Some of Aer Lingus's key assets are its name, brand strength and customer loyalty.  In an ill-conceived and commercially suspect decision, more damage has been done to that asset than could ever be gained by abandoning its loyal customer base, particularly as it relates to business customers, in Limerick and the mid-west.  In addition, the underhand manner in which management sought to time the publication of the announcement was an act of pure cowardice.  The fact that management did not even seek board approval for what has turned out to be a critical decision which has major implications for the airline raises serious questions about those in management.Much comment has been made in the media and elsewhere with regard to whether the potential fallout for the Shannon region has been exaggerated.  On the whole, it has not been exaggerated.  On the contrary — I am reluctant to say so — substantial damage has already been done to the region arising from the adverse publicity generated by this controversy.I take this opportunity to record my appreciation of the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance which has played an enormous role in preparing a comprehensive, credible and reasoned business case for the retention of Shannon-Heathrow connectivity.  Anybody who has spoken to the managers and chief executives of significant businesses in the mid-west can be in no doubt whatsoever about the serious impact this decision will have.  Like many in the House, I have spoken to dozens of managers who employ hundreds of people.  Their views must be taken seriously.The early indications are that the take-up on the proposed new Aer Lingus Belfast route is very poor.  Figures I obtained yesterday indicate that of the 18,762 seats offered by Aer Lingus, a grand total of 104 have been taken up.  That is less than one seat per flight.  Even at this stage these figures show a remarkably slow uptake in contrast to a proven, sustained demand from Shannon.  This alone should prompt Aer Lingus to re-evaluate its decision.  The management of Aer Lingus claims to have made the decision on purely commercial grounds.  If that was the case, there is now an onus on it to reassess its position.  The Atlantic Connectivity Alliance has made a very persuasive case that the Shannon-Heathrow link would be more profitable than the Belfast one.In the light of the poor uptake on seats on the new Belfast route, there is one obvious solution, namely, Aer Lingus should concentrate its sales on one slot only, redeploy two of its slots to a proven profitable route from Shannon and take one additional route from elsewhere.  In this regard, I refer to the motion before the Dáil and, in particular, the Government's endorsement of the Shannon Airport Authority's efforts to secure enhanced air access from Shannon to London Heathrow.  At the time of the passage of the State airports legislation I made it clear that the performance of the new Shannon Airport Authority would be monitored closely and regularly and that it was just as important to constantly review its incentive packages to existing airlines as well as developing new ones.  I note with interest a new package and incentive scheme launched by the Shannon Airport Authority on 12 September.  It would be prudent to await the outcome of expressions of interest in this package.  Was such a scheme considered before Aer Lingus made its decision?There are a number of other points I wish to make but I do not have time to do so.  I indicated at the outset of this controversy that it was my belief that this situation would not be resolved overnight.  Accordingly, I await with acute interest——

As a region, we were playing in the Premiership, but following the blow dealt by Aer Lingus, we are now in division one.  That is hardly good enough for a region that has been built up over many years on the premise that there would be connectivity with Shannon Airport.  It was an area in which people were prepared to invest very heavily but this has now been taken from us and I fear that not alone will we lose jobs in industry and tourism, we will also not be as attractive as other regions when it comes to attracting additional inward investment.  I give credit to successive Governments which have supported Shannon Airport and the Shannon region and made it what it is, namely, a region of which we are all very proud.  Everybody would agree with this.The timing of the decision by Aer Lingus was despicable and appalling.  We were all caught off guard.  It was taken without consultation with the staff, in particular, and Aer Lingus's own board.  It is very strange that a company could take such a decision unilaterally without consultation with its own board, which I find very difficult to understand.I set out my position clearly a number of weeks ago, reiterated it last week and will probably do so again today.  I do not need to be lectured by anybody inside or outside the House as to how I should speak or defend the people of Limerick West for whom I have spoken and worked since 1991.  I will let them judge me when judgment day comes around for me.Even though I am grateful for the Opposition's promptings, I am happy to support the Government based on what I have heard and been told at numerous meetings with the Taoiseach, the Minister and other senior Ministers.  The Minister outlined clearly to all concerned the reason the Government cannot intervene.  It has been given in a legal opinion by the Attorney General and I challenge any member of the Opposition to contradict it.

It has been set out clearly.  The alternative is to encourage and support another airline to fill the vacant slots, which I know the Government has been doing in consultation with the board of Shannon Airport.  Perhaps I am missing something but to be honest I cannot see any other alternative at this time.

I wonder why Aer Lingus decided to do this.   At a meeting in a hotel at Shannon Airport held a few days after this decision was taken and attended by a huge number of people, including respected business people and trade union representatives I was amazed to hear the statement that during the course of a board meeting that morning that a figure of €4.5 million was found for the route.  With all due respect, the horse had bolted.

However, Shannon Airport has been a major driver of economic growth in north Tipperary.  Many of my constituents and their families gain meaningful employment in the Shannon region.  Therefore, this is a vital decision for them.  With one fell swoop, it can wipe out all of this growth.It was with a degree of disillusionment that I listened to the Minister's speech.  I have never heard anything like his smart-aleck remarks or witnessed anything like his abrasive attitude towards the Opposition and, in particular, the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance, which I am here to support.  Either the Minister is out of touch or he has not been listening to what it has been saying to him.  The most senior international and regional executives from companies in the region have warned the Minister and the Government that there will be serious job losses in tourism — the figures indicate a 25% drop in bookings for 2008 — manufacturing and services.  This has been made quite clear to the Minister, yet he says it has been exaggerated.  That is a blatant lie.  I was always told that this was unparliamentary language but that is the allegation laid against the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance by the Minister.  I have heard no statements on this side of the House other than those agreed with the alliance.

The perception is that Aer Lingus is the national carrier and provides a degree of security for Shannon Airport and that, therefore, industrialists invest in the Shannon region.  This decision means that not only has the planned expansion of existing businesses been put on hold, but future investment is also being lost to the region, which is very serious.I am supporting the amendment moved by my colleague and the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance.  The Minister should return to the real world, take a firm grip and deal with the matter and forget about his smart-aleck remarks and change his attitude towards this side of the House.  When he referred to my party, he was referring to me.  I was never like that with him.  I always had the highest respect for him.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	315	This debate is about regionalisation and ensuring the implementation of regional policy.  I note the Government's commitment to its spatial strategy, which it has stated here today.  If the decision of Aer Lingus stands, and judging from the Minister's speech it looks like he will not make any effort to stop it, after next January there will be 33 flights to Heathrow from the north east corner of this island and five from the south west.  This does not reflect regional policy and a commitment to ensuring there is investment in the regions.In his speech, the Minister outlined how Heathrow is so important for connections to the Middle East, Asia and Africa.  Without that vital connection, one will not attract investment into regions.  We have heard that from the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance, which has briefed us all extremely well in the past number of days in Leinster House.  The slots to Heathrow are very important.  I am sure they are very important to Aer Lingus but more important to us as an island nation are the connections from Cork, Shannon and Dublin to Heathrow.  I was extremely disillusioned today when I heard the Minister acknowledge that it is critical to retain connectivity and wish Shannon Airport Authority well in its quest to ensure connectivity to Heathrow.  The Minister knows that with the Open Skies policy the Heathrow slots will become more valuable to Aer Lingus.  Who is to prevent it from serving Washington or southern Spain with these slots?  There is nothing to ensure the Heathrow slots for Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports will be retained.  While the Government retained 25.4% ownership of Aer Lingus to protect those slots, I question the information available to the Government at the time of privatisation.  I have reservations about the Government's aviation policy.  A mess has already been created at Cork and Shannon airports.  A promise was made that Cork Airport would maintain a debt-free and independent status which has not happened.  Another promise on maintaining flight connectivity in the regions has also not been fulfilled.  Will the Minister, as advised by Deputy O'Dowd, examine the public service obligation to ensure flight connections for the regions are maintained by Aer Lingus and regional development can happen?
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I entered public life 16 years ago and have attended many meetings regarding health care, schools, closure of hospitals and siting of incinerators.  However, at the meeting I attended in Shannon this summer I never saw such anger and frustration from representative groups and those workers whose jobs depend on the future of Shannon Airport.  From the Minister's speech it is obvious he is not connected to how the people of the Shannon region feel on this matter.The Aer Lingus decision also affects south County Tipperary where many people are annoyed by it.  This link has been in place since Shannon Airport was established.  If the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, were alive today, he would be supporting this side of the House and would not be happy with the Minister's speech on this motion.Three courses of action are open to the Minister.  I am at a loss as to why the vacancies on the Aer Lingus board of directors have not been filled.  Two directors should be appointed to the board by the Minister, as demanded by this side of the House and Aer Lingus workers.  If he did that, he would be applauded by all involved.After making these appointments, an EGM should be called to make a decision on the Heathrow service from Shannon Airport.  That is the proper way to do business but the Minister is allowing the situation, that has not changed since his meeting in Shannon, to continue.  There has been plenty of media coverage but still nothing has happened.  Representative groups from the Shannon area attending in the Visitors Gallery are amazed this situation has been allowed to continue.  It is up to the Minister and Government backbenchers to make those appointments and make the change which will affect generations in the region.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Since 2004, when I entered public life as a member of Limerick County Council, this has been the largest issue I have faced.  Since the news broke of the decision by Aer Lingus to move the Shannon-Heathrow slots to Belfast, public concern has been overwhelming.  I condemn this decision, in particular the unprofessional way in which Aer Lingus management handed it down.  Much legislation is in place to protect employees with various workplace respect and dignity polices, none of which was adhered to in this case.  Aer Lingus staff were treated shabbily through the selective leaking over a bank holiday weekend of a major decision affecting them.  The mid-west and west have received much adverse publicity as a result of this decision.  These regions face significant competitiveness issues in attracting inward foreign direct investment.  The mid-west region is on the periphery of the island of Ireland, which itself is on the periphery of Europe.I was one of the first to call on the Government to use its shareholding in Aer Lingus to discuss this decision.  On foot of this, the Minister explored it and he has given his reasons for the course of action he will take.  I will use my position in the Fianna Fáil Party to continue to find a solution to maintain connectivity.  Those whose jobs will be affected by this Aer Lingus decision want a solution to be found.I pay tribute to the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance and business leaders in the region.  Business leaders do not normally court publicity but have come out to make a case for maintaining the Heathrow connection.  I have taken part in media debates with Members from other political parties where the charge was made that people in the mid-west were overstating the case.  I received correspondence from a director in Aughinish Alumina who stated:. . . the Shannon/Heathrow route is critical as we sell our product into a global international market.  Gaining and maintaining customers in an extremely competitive marketplace is a constant business challenge for us.  Customer visits to the plant and key plant personnel visits to customers is fundamental to maintaining our customer base.  If customers cannot visit easily, personal contact will be lost and will result in the loss of contracts.  Similarly, if we cannot have direct access to our customers, then we will be at a significant disadvantage versus our competitors.Under no circumstances was the case for maintaining the route exaggerated by anyone in the mid-west region.  We must continue working to find a solution.  I have also received similar correspondence from the executive managing director, Dr. Helmut Koehler, of Olympus, a Clare-based company.  He stated:I should also like to thank you for the Irish Government and the Irish Industrial Development Authority support for our Irish facility to date.  We sincerely wish to see the continued development of this facility, however for this to be fulfilled there must be good connectivity.We must all work together to maintain route connectivity for Shannon Airport.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I am annoyed that the motions before the House only refer to the mid-west, south-west and north-west regional airports and ignore the west's regional airport in Knock.  I would have expected the Opposition to have picked up on that omission.There is little doubt that the loss of the Shannon-Heathrow link is a major setback to business and tourism in the mid-west.  A region that depended so much on its air access to the wider world will be deprived of the main plank of its success to date unless corrective action is taken.  This is something that we cannot and will not allow to happen.  Such a situation would further emphasise the regional imbalance between the east and the west about which I have spoken many times in this House.  However, this debate provides us with an opportunity to broaden the issue and to look at the threat to air access in a wider context.Companies in the Shannon basin need connectivity for their survival.  Nobody disputes that for a moment.  However, there are scores of manufacturing companies from Donegal to Sligo, Mayo to Galway which are equally in need of connectivity if they are to survive, perhaps even more so because of the totally inadequate road system which is playing havoc with transport costs.  Companies such as Abbott and Hollister in my constituency, Allergen which last year celebrated 30 years in Westport, Baxter, Coca-Cola and many more are struggling with transport costs which could be greatly alleviated with proper air access.  Balanced regional development must mean balanced regional air access.  The western half of the country needs direct connection to the UK and Europe, key European hubs and transatlantic services.  Best of all, we have the airports to sustain a truly integrated cohesive air policy for the west.  In Knock, Shannon and Cork there are three airports with the capacity and resources to really drive regional development.  More than 1 million people live within a 90 minute drive of each of these airports.  Surely this means that the essential framework is already in place for an air access policy which can transform the west of Ireland.  The rules for national policy must be on an all-Ireland basis if we are to overcome this particular setback and attain a sustainable foundation.There are 31 flights to Heathrow from the east coast of Ireland, including Northern Ireland and Dublin, and 58 to other London airports.  From the entire west coast, south-west, mid-west, west and north-west there is a combined total of five flights to Heathrow — that is after Aer Lingus withdraws from Shannon — and 16 to other London airports.  It is important to point out that any attempt by Government to interfere in the market for any one region will distort the market for another.  Knock is at present in commercial discussions with airlines regarding London links, including Heathrow.  Any public or political intervention must aim at creating a level playing field for all of the west.  This is not just a mid-west problem and its resolution does not have ramifications for that region alone.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The decision by Aer Lingus to discontinue its Shannon-Heathrow service without an adequate replacement will be a devastating blow to business and tourism in the mid-west region.  Countless jobs, a myriad of industries and tourism in the region are dependent on a vibrant Shannon Airport.  Aer Lingus knows a Shannon-Heathrow route is viable, but sees a more lucrative opportunity in moving the coveted Heathrow slots to Belfast.  This is a desperately cynical move by a company that holds itself up as the national airline.The Aer Lingus decision is a selfish vested interest approach.  It shows no regard for the consequences and the impact on a dedicated workforce and a supportive industrial and commercial base.  It is a decision that shows contempt for the loyalty of the public in the mid-west region.  Heathrow is our closest gateway to the global economy, giving the mid-west region one-stop connectivity with over 200 destinations across the globe.  Renewal or replacement of the Heathrow slots is imperative to ensure that the mid-west is not saddled with a major disadvantage in a world where international connectivity is a crucial element in gaining economic advantage.  It is crucial that the current negotiations to restore connectivity to Heathrow are successful.In the Shannon region we have advanced internal infrastructure and telecommunications.  We have one of the most productive, skilled and educated workforces in the world.  We must ensure that international companies can access them and that domestic enterprises can effectively export the produce of their collective talents.  Management of Aer Lingus has publicly stated its position in trenchant terms.  It is blatantly dismissive of reasoned logical argument against its position and is openly confrontational.Even if the Government were successful in calling an extraordinary general meeting, it is the advice of the Attorney General, I understand, that the board of Aer Lingus would not be bound to follow any resolutions seeking to reverse its business decisions.  In these legal circumstances it is clear that any attempt to overturn the decision would be fraught with legalities leading to protracted contentious and divisive proceedings, the negativity of which would ultimately damage the future of Shannon and the region.  As Deputy Róisín Shortall pointed out in the privatisation debate that took place in the House last year, it is also likely that the European Commission would rule against the Government exercising a so-called controlling share in such a manner.I fear that forcing the board of Aer Lingus to reverse its decision could be a futile exercise.  The company will not embrace a forced decision with the necessary enthusiasm of commitment to ensure its success.  A decision in such circumstances would gradually be undermined by the management of Aer Lingus.Arising from this debate and the obvious cross-party concern that exists, it is to be hoped that Aer Lingus will accept the error of its decision and willingly review its stance, agree to renew the route and actively promote activity between Shannon and Heathrow.  If Aer Lingus fails to respond positively we should provide the conditions and incentives to guarantee an immediate replacement carrier.  International connectivity to the Shannon region is not optional.  It is an absolute necessity.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I wish to share time with Deputy Martin Ferris, if that is agreeable.Having been in this House for just over two decades and in the Seanad for almost a decade, I cannot recall a motion quite so weak as the one before us.  The opening paragraph of the motion to the effect that Dáil Éireann is called on to share the Government's deep disappointment at the Aer Lingus decision to end the Shannon-London Heathrow service stops just short of asking us to have a weep-in for the destruction being visited on the region.  The Minister's speech is seriously contestable in a number of fundamental points of fact on the issue.  He cites page 20 of the report of the senior officials:Disposal of slots relates specifically to the sale of slots and/or the transfer of slots between airlines and does not apply to the reallocation of slot pairs to new or existing bases.I repeat it is most contestable and is a very limited reading of what is, in fact, in the memorandum and articles of association.  The Minister continued:However, let me be clear, the Government's legal advice is that, having regard to the duties of the Board of Directors pursuant to the Companies Acts and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Aer Lingus, shareholders do not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters.This is a meaningless statement and largely untrue.  There is nothing in the Companies Acts that suggests the management has a type of carte blanche that is accountable neither to the board or to shareholders.  Contradictions riddle the Minister’s speech.  He mentions two key objectives of the State’s shareholding — providing a major block to a hostile takeover by enabling the State to prevent a compulsory takeover of 100%; and enabling Government to protect the memorandum and articles of association of the company.  How can the Minister be protecting the memorandum and articles of association of the company when disposal is defined there as including the transfer of slots?I want to put a more fundamental case in this regard.  These slots are not in the absolute ownership of Aer Lingus.  In the debate in the House of Commons in 2003-04 on the reorganisation of services at Heathrow, it was decided that one could not conclude fundamentally that the slots were in the possession of the airlines in question.  The basis for my assertion is that the original slots were negotiated at intergovernmental talks.The same type of retreat from responsibility is contained in the flat negatives in relation to regionalism in the Minister's regional policy.  Connectivity is important for the entire economy.  This is not a case of the west versus the rest.  It is a question of ensuring the equal rights of regions to be developed and even national development.  "Connectivity" is described in the memorandum and articles of association.  In the case of Dublin Airport, it is described in terms of not exceeding 90 minutes.  At the same time the concept of connectivity can be abandoned altogether in respect of another region, or several regions.  This affects not just one region.The Government's Deputies and Ministers are being sent out to mislead people regarding the Government's capacity.  The notion that the Government cannot use its shareholding because it might upset a minor shareholder is simply not true.  The Government, as the holder of 25% of the shares, is under an obligation regarding its shareholding to protect the brand name, capacity and asset value of the company.  If the actions of an unaccountable management damage these, the Government is obliged, under the memorandum and articles of association, and under company law, to protect its shareholding.The abandonment of regionalism is consistent with the Minister's answer to Question No. 488 of today.  He mentions the justification for not spending one red cent on Ceannt Station in the city I represent and in which I get more votes than anybody else.  He stated: "Funding for the upgrading of transport facilities of Ceannt Station, Galway has not been included in Transport 21 as I understand that CIE intends to fund the works involved from the proceeds of the development of the overall site".  There is not a penny for regional investment in the major hub in the west.  This is consistent with the decision on Aer Lingus and the failure to spend the funds in the BMW region.  We will hear the windy basis of the Minister's statement about being committed to regional policy.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The disastrous circumstances concerning Aer Lingus have arisen because of Fianna Fáil's decision to privatise our former national airline.  The blame lies solely at the Government's door and its motion is of scant consolation to those in the mid-west who will be affected by the loss of employment, damage to tourism and a lack of access to Heathrow, one of the world's most important transport hubs.Sinn Féin was vehemently opposed to the privatisation of Aer Lingus from the outset and warned that the process would undermine the delivery of national and regionally balanced services, worsen workers' terms and conditions and put in jeopardy the future of the airline's operations anywhere on the island.  Sinn Féin forewarned that a privately owned Aer Lingus would be concerned only with the maximisation of profit for its shareholders and would have no interest in the social and economic needs of the Irish people.  The Government has already abdicated its responsibility to ensure that, as an island nation, we have a national airline to play a vital infrastructural role.Aer Lingus's announcement on cancelling Shannon-Heathrow flights will have serious repercussions for inward investment, tourism and indigenous businesses in the mid-west.  Privatisation is a tried and failed economic ideology.  The selling off of public services and interests does not deliver better services, more jobs and a stronger economy.  As socialist republicans, we believe it is imperative that such assets remain in State hands under democratic public control in order to best serve the public interest.Fianna Fáil is paying lip service to balanced regional development.  At the very least, the Government should exercise its strength as a key shareholder in Aer Lingus by demanding that the company immediately reverse its decision to close the Shannon-Heathrow route.  The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport and the Marine, Deputy Pat Gallagher, stood up in this Chamber and reassured Members that the Government would guarantee the protection of the State's strategic interests and that remaining a significant minority shareholder would ensure this.  It made the same point to the farmers and workers in the sugar industry in Mallow and Carlow and said their interests would be protected by the golden share.  Where is the golden share for the workers and producers of Mallow and Carlow?  Where is the golden share for the workers and commuters in Shannon?  The Government has misled us grossly and is being economical with the truth in the highest order.The introduction of Aer Lingus's Belfast-Heathrow route is a very welcome and positive development, but it should not be at the expense of Shannon.  One region should not be played off against another.  This is what is happening and the Government's supporters in the mid-west have engaged in a whispering campaign and are trying to excuse themselves by saying the closure of the Shannon-Heathrow route and the move to Belfast is a spin-off of the peace process.  This is a despicable tactic but all too typical of this Government.We need an all-Ireland vision for Aer Lingus and the airport sector.  The west needs a long-term, balanced regional development plan and the three airports should complement one another instead of competing.  Not only has Aer Lingus washed its hands of Shannon but it seems the Government has followed suit.  There has never been any rational argument advanced for the sell-off of Aer Lingus other than to satisfy the insatiable demands of the privatisation lobby within both Government parties and their financiers in the private sector.The disgraceful privatisation has been a betrayal of the Irish people.  Its consequences, with the closure of small post offices, the privatisation of Greencore and the continuing decline in the rural population, have been very serious.  At the stroke of a pen, the Minister destroyed the fishing sector earlier this year.  This is what the Government is doing to destroy the fabric of rural Ireland, which has served us so well through the years.  It should be ashamed about what it is doing.  It has sold out the workers in Shannon and the drift fishermen.  By introducing legislation to criminalise the fishing industry, it has destroyed the west of Ireland.  The Minister is responsible and it will be his legacy to this House.

We welcome the fact that over 50 destinations are served through Shannon and this has a very positive impact on north Tipperary.  However, the decision by Aer Lingus to close the Shannon-Heathrow link came as a major disappointment.  I believe it will see the error of this decision as time unfolds.  Already we see that the take-up in Belfast is quite poor.  Heathrow is already being served from Belfast by other airlines and consequently I do not yet understand Aer Lingus's decision.I, like my party colleagues, called on the Minister for Transport and the Marine and the Taoiseach to intervene in the airline's decision.  Legal advice was taken, the articles of association were examined and we learned it was not possible to intervene in the way proposed.

Higgins's point also.Article 84 of the articles of association contains a number of limitations on the right of a shareholder to overrule Aer Lingus's management decisions on business matters.  In law, the directors are responsible for managing the company's business and the shareholders are not entitled to overrule management's decisions on business issues by way of a resolution passed at an extraordinary general meeting.  Furthermore, directors are not obliged, as a matter of law, to follow any directions from the shareholders in respect of business matters or to obey any resolution with regard to such matters.  We accept we must then examine other means, including other airlines, and offer the most attractive package with a view to retaining the Heathrow-Shannon route.I have had regular discussions with the Minister and the Taoiseach on this matter, as have my colleagues from the mid-west.  We support them in their efforts and emphasise to them the extreme importance of maintaining economic growth, retaining jobs and sustaining businesses in the mid-west region.  Some 300 businesses were represented at the meeting at Shannon.  They made it clear to us how important the slots were.Long before Aer Lingus made the decision, the Minister for Finance introduced tax incentives for development in the mid-west area, particularly lake shore developments along Lough Derg in County Clare and North Tipperary.  These will be more important in view of the recent decision by Aer Lingus.When the issue of Shannon Airport came before us in this House, it concerned the sustainability of Shannon Airport and whether the Government would allow US troops to travel through Shannon Airport.  The Government voted to allow troops through Shannon in the interests of sustainability, jobs and economic growth of the mid-west region.

West Tipperary has a close relationship with the Limerick and Shannon region in terms of employment and services.  Several people from there are employed at Shannon, including Aer Lingus employees.  There is also a wider interest common to all counties outside the metropolitan area in maintaining regional balance.  During much of the 20th century the Shannon area was the prime area of economic development in the State, pioneering electricity generation, air transport, industrial development, tourism and a new, more technologically and Atlantic oriented third level institution.Today, the Irish economy is vastly wealthier and more diversified but Dublin and the east coast have taken over as the prime economic locomotive.  The Aer Lingus decision on the bank holiday weekend is a particularly blatant and deplorable jerk of the blanket towards the east coast.  I have no time for a macho style of management that flouts Government policy, ignoring the State's continuing stake and the public interest.Reluctantly in the Seanad, I supported the part privatisation of Aer Lingus.  We came close to losing the airline in the aftermath of 11 September 2001, when some European companies did not survive.  We understood wrongly that, apart from the transatlantic services, the Heathrow slots and connectivity, including Shannon, would be protected.  This underlines the importance of how the small print is drafted.The Shannon Airport Authority has been wrongly criticised for its special deal with Ryanair.  Aer Lingus services have been cut down to three transatlantic services with connections to Dublin and the Heathrow flights.  In contrast, as of last August, Aer Lingus services 58 British and European destinations from Dublin and 18 from Cork.  Some 79% of passengers through the State airports in 2006 passed through Dublin Airport and vigorous policy initiatives are needed to spread the growth and stop it being concentrated in one airport with two or three terminals.Once described as the national airline, it is doubtful if this applies any longer.  In view of Aer Lingus's lack of interest in Shannon, outside of transatlantic services, the airport authority must quickly find other companies to fill the gap if economic confidence in the region as an industrial and service base is to be maintained.As someone whose involvement in Northern Ireland policy began nearly 30 years ago in the field of North-South co-operation, I welcome Aer Lingus opening a hub in Belfast, something that would not have been possible in the 1980s unless heavily disguised.  It is an exciting development but should have been achieved by a redistribution of slots without cutting out Shannon.I am shocked by the simplistic and partitionist Opposition call to reverse the decision.  It would cause a full-blown crisis in North-South relations.

Not far up the road at — note the name — Ireland West Airport, Knock, the airport authority off its own bat — without any hand-holding or major support, managed to develop the airport into one that caters for 600,000 passengers.  This time last year, Ryanair, the champion of regional development, pulled the Knock-Gatwick service.  The airport authority worked to secure a replacement.  This morning the board announced the recommencement of Knock-Gatwick services three times a day, starting from December.  That shows the value of an authority that makes decisions and that is responsible to the shareholders and people from the area.  The sooner we position the Shannon authority on that basis, the better.  It can then be accountable, with particular reference to Deputy Cregan's remarks on the activities of the authority before Aer Lingus pulled out.I am interested in Deputy Higgins's comments on slots.  Slots should not belong to a private company, they are a national asset.  If difficulties exist we should examine these in the context of European competition.  If half of the supports available to the Shannon region were available to my county it would be much better off.  This Government has shown great commitment to the Shannon and mid-west region.  This is not an inter-region debate but I remember when we campaigned to have the airport built at Knock.  Signs in Clare read: "If you support an airport in Mayo, don't knock".  We need pride in our airport and the work done without any hand-holding.

Watching the performance of backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies I can only marvel at the ability to talk in any direction without appearing to move or turn.  Now they are showing us they can act as well.  This year's Oscar in the category of outstanding individual performance in comedy drama must go to Fianna Fáil backbenchers in the role of Opposition spokespersons for the west of Ireland.  There was strong competition from ministerial colleagues, most notably the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea.  He gave a most convincing performance, which, in normal circumstances, would have made him immediately eligible for back bench status.Today is the Oscar presentation ceremony.  Who will walk to the podium to collect an award?  Looking across the floor, I am reminded of the comment of the former Member, Joe Higgins, who returned home in November to find his wardrobe had been visited and his best socialist suits had been borrowed.  During the past month I had a feeling of déjà vu, thinking that many backbenchers had come visiting to try on the Opposition wardrobe.  Our reinvigorated Fine Gael party will ensure that next time the Opposition suit will fit them.  We now see the true character of Fianna Fáil politicians who talk the loudest.  They talk the talk, now we will see if they walk the walk or even sit out the talk.  As I look across there are not many sitting out the talk.Removing the air services to Heathrow is a damaging blow to Shannon Airport.  It is also a powerful symbolic action, with serious implications for people living in the western region.  Aer Lingus management should not be blamed for the transfer of the Heathrow slots to Belfast.  When a company makes a major strategic decision about its future there can be little room for sentiment.  No successful company makes a major strategic decision based on sentimental attachment to the past.  Commercial success is concerned with the future and rigorous assessment of the present.The privatisation of Aer Lingus is a perfect example of what happens when sentiment is taken into commercial decision making.  The Government decision to privatise Aer Lingus was largely doctrinaire and when sentimental politics got in the way, the key issue of ownership was fudged.  This left us with the fiasco facing us today.  This seemed like a good idea to the Government because it could have significant shareholder authority without political responsibility.  Like other cunning schemes, it has come unstuck.  The Government has a mishmash of little authority and evasion of actual responsibility in that the transfer of the Heathrow slots from Shannon to Belfast is a direct commercial consequence of earlier Government decisions.The Government has an unavoidable responsibility to address the present situation.  To avoid further divergence between the economic conditions of the east and west I urge it to immediately launch a major review of regional development policy.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	357	It is obvious that before Aer Lingus made this decision which has no commercial basis whatsoever, it had full consultation with the Government and was given clearance from the Minister and from the Government.The mid-west region is one of the most dynamic in this country and in Europe.  One of the main drivers of that dynamism is the Shannon-Heathrow link which has been in place for many years and operated by Aer Lingus.  Many of the major industries in the region would not be there but for this connection.  Managing directors and executives of companies no longer want to spend their time in planes.  They want to travel to work as quickly as possible.I spoke recently to overseas members of Ballybunion Golf Club who depend on this air link.  A total of 25% to 30% of the customers of Ballybunion Golf Club travel through Heathrow.  They travel from all parts of Europe and America.  Without this connection there would be a significant drop in the number of golfers coming to Ballybunion and this would affect the whole town of Ballybunion which depends so much on the golf course.  This is an area with very few jobs.  Ballybunion was planning to spend €3 million on a second golf course and the target customers were to be drawn from the greater London and Heathrow area.  The proposed golf course is currently being promoted and this marketing campaign will collapse because of this decision.It irritates me to listen to speakers bring Iraq into the equation or to listen to Deputy Mansergh raise the issue of partition.  This has nothing to do with Belfast or any other airport; it is to do with Shannon.  The Members opposite who represent the mid-west region and the western seaboard will be judged on whether there will be four slots.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is a good friend of mine and he is a pragmatist.  Along with Deputy Ó Cuív he will be judged on whether or not these four slots will be there next January.  This is how people will judge the Deputies and all the spin in the world will not fool the people of the region.I wish to acknowledge the work of the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance which has provided us with accurate statistics and information and for encompassing all the interest groups of the area into one voice.  This is a very important day for the whole region of the western seaboard.  The Government has shown the white flag and the Deputies have given up on Aer Lingus connectivity with Heathrow.

The Dáil was given those assurances.  If the Government now states it will not interfere in the matter then the Minister misled the Dáil when the privatisation Bill was going through.  If the Government is now washing its hands of the matter why is it holding on to the 25% share?  It does not make sense.  Why does it not sell the shares?The decision to transfer the slots from Shannon will have a serious effect on business, tourism and jobs in our region.  The Government Ministers acknowledge that the decision is contrary to Government regional and aviation policy.  The Government professes to be committed to regional development through the national spatial strategy.  If it is committed in the programme for Government to a link road corridor between Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Shannon and Galway and if it is serious in its commitment to these projects, why is it now standing idly by and allowing this decision to be made?  Nero fiddled when Rome burned.  I do not know if fiddles were even invented at that time but there are certainly fiddles now.The decision to transfer the Shannon-Heathrow slots from Shannon will have serious repercussions for tourism business in the mid-west and in Galway.  It is estimated that Galway receives 12,000 tourists a year through Shannon.  Hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money was expended on grants and tax incentives and on the refurbishment of hotels in the region.  Is the Government aware of the devastating effect the loss of this business will have on the region?  I call on the Ministers and Deputies in the region who initially spoke out against this decision to stand up and be counted.  Where is my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív in this matter?  Where is comedian Minister, Deputy O'Dea today?  He was in great form yesterday but I do not hear much of him today.What is happening to Shannon now could happen to Cork or Dublin at the executive will of Aer Lingus.  The Government is setting a precedent whereby it will be unable to stop this happening.  Nobody is safe from the so-called commercial decisions.  This is not solely a matter for the mid-west region.

I am a Deputy for Dublin North which has Dublin Airport at the heart of its commercial life.  The decision by Aer Lingus to transfer its Heathrow slots from Shannon Airport could be followed by a decision tomorrow to do the same in Dublin.  The Government gave an undertaking to protect the Heathrow slots at Shannon, Cork and Dublin and now betrays this undertaking at the first request.  We are an island nation and national interests take precedence over perceived short-term goals.  I use the word "perceived" because numerous slots from Belfast to Heathrow already exist and the commercial need for the decision has been disputed.I ask the Minister to take his responsibilities seriously.  I urge him to use the Government's 25% stakeholding in Aer Lingus to protect the Shannon slots as he promised this House and the country.

Of course I welcome the development of service in Belfast but I believe this should not have happened at the expense of Shannon.  Since the announcement I have received many calls asking me to make representations to the Government to force Aer Lingus to reverse its decision.

I have a firm belief that when a problem arises it is foolish to waste time on what might have been if decisions had been taken differently in the past.  It is impossible to foresee everything.  The reality is that the only way to resolve problems is to look at the reality of the present and, based on that, plan for the future.

When Aer Lingus took the decision to discontinue the Shannon-Heathrow route, it was clear that the loss of the important air link would have an impact on the region.  The challenge for Government now is to continue its investment plan in the region and to support the airport authority in its effort to replace that link.  The regrettable decision by Aer Lingus will not mean that the Shannon area suddenly becomes a wasteland.

It would be bad news for consumers and national aviation policy.  I am no economist, but even I know that to keep prices and services consumer-focused requires competition.

I look forward to working with him.  I also congratulate Deputy Wall and look forward to working with him also for whatever period we are together.The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 has achieved considerable success across a range of areas in reducing the hardship caused to individuals and society by problem drug use.  Under the strategy, the Government continues to address problem drug use in a co-ordinated way through the original four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.  These have been augmented, following the mid-term review of the strategy in 2005, by the fifth pillar regarding rehabilitation.The levels of drugs seizures by the Garda and the Customs and Excise have been well in excess of the targets set out in the strategy and they include a number of significant operations.  Under the prevention pillar, the SPHE and Walk Tall programmes have been rolled out to all schools.  Awareness campaigns have been organised and tremendous achievements have been made under the young people's facilities and services fund.  Treatment facilities have increased significantly, with approximately 8,500 in receipt of methadone in July, and a range of services are being provided across the statutory, voluntary and community sectors for various types of problem drug use.  Research in areas such as drugs prevalence, the outcome of heroin treatment, families and drugs, the effect of drugs on communities and cocaine issues have all helped to inform our progress.The specific achievements of my Department under the strategy include the programmes developed by local and regional drugs task forces, capital projects developed under the premises initiative fund and preventive actions undertaken through the young people's facilities and services fund.  The 14 local drugs task forces are well established, having been in operation for nearly ten years.  At this stage, more than 440 community-based projects are being supported, employing more than 300 people and delivering a wide range of services and supports for problem drug users, their families and their broader communities.  Furthermore, through the emerging needs fund, approximately €4 million was allocated to 67 projects last year to ensure that the drugs problem was being combated on the ground in the most timely and flexible way.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.An evaluation of approximately 270 interim funded LDTF projects is under way and it is expected to be completed later this year.  The outcome of this evaluation will help to inform the way forward for any development and strengthening of projects at LDTF level.Ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, were also established in 2003, thus ensuring that all parts of the country now benefit from the operation of a drugs task force.  Following extensive consultation processes, all regions prepared strategic plans which are now being rolled out in the different areas.  The RDTFs will be pressing ahead towards full implementation of their plans in the coming year or two at a full cost of approximately €14 million.On capital funding, a premises initiative fund is now open to applications from all drug task forces to address the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects.  It is envisaged that RDTFs will come forward with an increased range of proposals under this fund in the coming period.The young people's facilities and services fund was established to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The main aim of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  The target group of the programme is young people in the age range of ten to 21 years who are defined as "at risk" due to factors such as family circumstances, educational disadvantage, or involvement in crime or substance misuse.Earlier this week, I was pleased to announce additional capital allocations of nearly €7 million to support 42 projects under the fund.  To date, allocations of more than €125 million have been made to almost 500 facility and services projects in LDTF areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork, as well as in Galway, Limerick and Waterford cities and Carlow town.The Government is committed to maximising the successful outcomes of the current national drugs strategy.  The allocation of €50 million this year in my Department's Vote clearly illustrates this point.  This amount represents an increase of 16% on the 2006 figure and is 87% higher than the corresponding figure for 2004.  In all, more than €200 million was spent on various drugs programmes across Departments and Government agencies last year.  Indeed, this figure is exclusive of the many mainstream services that are availed of, in the normal way, by those affected by problem drug use.Meanwhile, we continue to adapt our approach to drugs issues in a flexible manner to address evolving situations.  In that regard, I am overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the national advisory committee on drugs entitled An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland, largely through the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair.  In this context, significant efforts are being made at both statutory and community level to tackle that problem.Looking forward, the programme for Government contains commitments in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group on drug rehabilitation, developing and strengthening the range of drug task force projects, continuing and extending the young people's facilities and services fund and providing cocaine specific facilities.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be working to ensure that these commitments are fulfilled.I will shortly be initiating the process that will lead to the formulation of a new national drugs strategy for the period after 2008.  While the challenges ahead are clearly significant, I am confident that we can build on our experiences and achievements to date in meeting them.

As today is the first Question Time for the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, I wish him the best of luck.  I congratulate him on his appointment and look forward to working with him.  He has arranged for a briefing for us by his Department, which I welcome.  The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has agreed to do the same.The Minister of State probably has the most important job in the country at present.  We have a very serious drug problem.  We are spending considerable resources without seeming to have the result.  With regard to the money spent by the Department trying to address the drug problem, what targets have been set and how many of them have been met?  A number of people have already contacted me who wished to get their sons or daughters on detoxification programmes.  I am advised that only 25 beds are available, all of which are in Dublin.  No places are available for people outside Dublin.  If people reach the stage of being ready for detoxification it is not appropriate that they must wait 15 or 16 weeks for a bed.  What will the Minister of State and the Department do to address this issue?Considering the money that is spent how does the Department measure success and how is it measured internationally?  Is the Department reaching the targets set in its programme?  This is the most important problem facing society at present.  Later I have a further question about drugs coming into the country.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I agree this task is one of the most challenging there is.  Having spent the past three months meeting local drugs task forces and some regional drugs task forces, I am very impressed by the range of work being carried out at local level by the community and voluntary sector and by the statutory sector.  In regard to the amount spent, I can provide the Deputy with a detailed breakdown.  In 2006, in excess of €200 million was spent across a range of Departments and agencies, including the drugs strategy unit, the Department of Health and Children, the HSE, FÁS, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Prison Service, the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise.  In addition, there was considerable further expenditure on schemes that have been mainstreamed since the drugs strategy was put in place over the past ten years, ranging across a number of Departments and agencies, including the Departments of Education and Science, and Health and Children, FÁS and others.In regard to targets, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs is constantly reviewing the targets and benchmarking against previous studies.  The mid-term review of the national drugs strategy is almost complete.  All the projects have been evaluated.  We are close to identifying those that will be in a position to be mainstreamed and they will be re-examined.  The actions in the national drugs strategy, of which there are more than 100, are being reviewed.  In the Rehab Group annual report, which was published at the height of the general election when few of us had time to read it, there is a proposal to increase the number of treatment detox beds, some of which will be in a hospital setting.  I have been examining how the community and voluntary sector, under strict clinical governance, could increase the number of detox beds in that area.  I am discussing that with some of the providers.  One measure of success is the ROSIE study.  It is a very detailed piece of research which is mirrored across other European and OECD countries and tells us how we are doing.  We are doing reasonably well but complacency is not something we can afford.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Are there any plans for a national advertising campaign on the abuse of drugs which would be made available in schools?  There are campaigns on drink driving.  It is time for one on drugs.  This is the biggest single problem we face and does not only affect deprived areas.  It is in middle class and wealthy communities where people use their credit cards to snort the drug.  It is time there were raids on the upper classes as well as targeting disadvantaged areas.  I hope we will see real efforts by the Government to show people the effects of drug abuse on people and communities.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	488	Advertising is part of the national drugs strategy.  We have a number of pilot projects, in particular, one in the Blanchardstown area where there is a freefone service, a texting service and a postal service.  The national drugs strategy intends rolling that out over a wider area.  I am also examining other ways of targeting young people using new web-based and text-based technologies.  I have had some discussions with some of the groups that specialise in that area and hope to bring proposals to Government fairly soon.In regard to schools, the SPHE programme is taught through junior cycle.  I met the SPHE co-ordinators in July.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I am aware of the recent report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which suggested that Ireland is experiencing a higher rate of increase in cocaine use than other developed countries.  I must stress, however, that it is the rate of increase that was being assessed in the report, not the actual level of cocaine usage.  Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that our rate of increase is coming from a very low base and, within developed countries, we are considered a mid-ranking country in terms of cocaine usage.  Major European countries such as Great Britain and Spain are continuing to experience higher rates of usage.The report uses indirect indicators such as numbers presenting for treatment, arrest numbers and levels of seizures to measure cocaine usage.  However, it is only when the second national drug prevalence survey is completed, the first reports from which are expected later this year, that we will have an up-to-date picture of the prevalence of cocaine use in our society.  It is worth noting that the main author of the report, Mr. Thomas Pietschmann, attributed the result in part to "honest reporting" by the Irish Government.  He further commented that it is normal for countries that are performing well economically to be targeted for cocaine sales.The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the national drugs strategy team prepared a joint briefing paper on cocaine based on existing data in Ireland.  The paper, An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland, which was published earlier this year, concluded that data sources indicated an upward trend in cocaine use, again albeit from a low base.  The paper also highlighted the extremely high risks associated with cocaine and the physical and mental health problems that arise from its use.Cocaine is particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and other substances and these messages on the real dangers associated with its use need to be highlighted.  The social and economic harm also needs to be stressed, not only to the users of cocaine, but also to their families and to communities that bear the brunt of the behaviour and criminal activity associated with the supply and use of cocaine.  I have repeatedly stressed the dangers associated with so-called recreational or weekend cocaine use and the glamorising of cocaine in some quarters.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.A number of recommendations are made in the paper, principally in regard to treatment, but also covering supply, prevention and research.  A key conclusion of the report is that treatment, primarily in the form of counselling, can and does work and, in this context, the provision of cocaine-specific clinics in a small number of areas where cocaine problems are more acute is being pursued.  However, in the broader context, I am of the view that we should work towards having drug services that can cater for individual problem drug users, regardless of the drugs they use and this is also being addressed.Another key recommendation relates to the training of frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues.  In this regard, a training initiative has already been funded by my Department, as well as four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use.  Meanwhile, the HSE has initiated the roll-out of further training for both its own staff and those in the community and voluntary sectors who are dealing with the issue.Under the emerging needs fund, six cocaine specific projects in local drugs task force areas have been funded and support for a further nine projects aimed at polydrug-cocaine use has also been provided under that fund.  My Department also sponsored a highly successful conference in June last organised by the SAOL project and the NDST on the response to cocaine through shared good practice.  A very useful resource pack for workers in the field was launched at that event.  Progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the briefing paper is being closely monitored by the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair.  In addition, the HSE is addressing the issue in a determined way and the NDST, along with the drug task forces, will continue to review the needs in communities.The challenges posed by cocaine use are significant, but I am confident that we can meet these challenges through a co-ordinated approach utilising the structures of the national drugs strategy.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I thank the Minister of State for his offer of a briefing and also the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, for his note and his offer of a briefing.The United Nations report is negative.  It states that Ireland ranks fifth highest in terms of the increase in cocaine use and is the only developed nation that has experienced a large increase in use.  If one examines the records, everything has increased tenfold since 1999.  The number of cocaine-related offences recorded by the Garda Síochána has increased fourfold from 297 to 1,224.  Cocaine seizures have increased from 17 kg in 2002 to 270 kg in 2006.  Everything is going in the opposite direction to what we want.We should not accept that it is normal for cocaine use to increase if we are doing well.  What alternatives are we providing to weekend use of cocaine?  According to the report, 2 kg of cocaine per day is consumed in the greater Dublin area.  What is being done to break that momentum?  The figures in this report indicate we are not doing anything and that we are allowing use of cocaine to increase to epidemic proportions.  It is imperative that we put down markers to try to break that momentum.  Otherwise we will experience again what we experienced in the early 1990s with heroin.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The use of cocaine is worrying.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.  It is now a phenomenon across all social classes.  That was highlighted in the Rehab Group report and in the report on cocaine which was published earlier this year.  There are measures and pilot projects, including four cocaine-specific initiatives.  There is one in Blanchardstown and another in the south inner city.  I do not recall where the others are at the moment.  I will come back to the Deputy on that issue.  These projects are being used to develop best practice in the area of treatment for cocaine use.In the wider area of treatment, there are very good community-based interventions in terms of holistic therapies, cognitive behaviour therapies, acupuncture and so on, which are proving quite successful.  That, however, will not be enough.  We need to have further interventions.  Ireland ranks fifth highest in terms of the increase in cocaine use.  It remains considerably behind the United Kingdom and Spain, which is no great consolation.  The track of cocaine coming from South America has changed.  The current route to mainland Europe is through Colombia, west Africa and Mediterranean countries.  The Garda Síochána seized 18 kilogrammes of cocaine in 2002.  Some 190,000 kilogrammes with a street value of €13 million were seized in 2006.  That is an enormous increase and very worrying.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	492	The level of funding provided in this area is not sufficient.  The president of EURAD stated the Government had concentrated resources in methadone clinics and failed to address the drugs problem holistically.  We are not doing enough, in terms of advertising, to show the downside of drugs.  It is fashionable to take cocaine.  We must tackle this problem by providing an alternative.  How does the Minister of State propose to do this?  I admit the task is a difficult one but we will play our part in supporting the Minister of State in his efforts to address it.  He has stated three projects have been initiated in certain parts of Dublin to try to address this problem.  He might as well be sweeping the streets in those areas because this will not have any affect nationally.  These three projects will not break the momentum of the drug barons of Ireland.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	493	The three projects to which I referred are very specific.  Local drugs task forces, the HSE and others provide for a wide range of interventions.  We are developing best practice.  While there is no alternative to cocaine in terms of medication, there are interventions in terms of therapies and so on.  It is not true to say nothing is being done.  An important intervention which has been approved by the Cabinet is the Lisbon centre.  Ireland will be one of seven European countries which will collect data intelligence on cocaine trafficking and devise intelligence-led measures to counter the epidemic.

While such services are available in the more developed rural areas, by either hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers and do not provide a guaranteed service for rural people.  It was against this background, therefore, that earlier this year I introduced a new evening transport service on a pilot basis to allow rural people to fully participate in community, sports and social activities taking place in their areas.  The new scheme also aims to address the current market failure in this area.The 34 groups delivering the rural transport programme operated by the Department of Transport were invited by Pobal to submit applications for consideration under the new scheme.  Following the appraisal of the proposals submitted, seven groups were selected to run the pilot scheme, namely, West Cork Rural Transport, Avondhu Development Group in east Cork, Meath Accessible-Kilnaleck Community Cavan, County Sligo Leader Partnership, Tumna Shannon Development Company Roscommon, Síob Teoranta Donegal and, Laois Trip.  The projects were selected having regard to such criteria as evidence of need, strength of proposal, capacity of the group, value for money and geographical spread.The budget for the pilot scheme is €500,000.  The first service commenced in June and service and passenger numbers are expected to increase throughout the autumn.  Although only in the early stages, I understand the services are being very well received by communities and passengers alike.  Early indications are that older people, people with a disability and young people are particularly enthusiastic about the new services and new activities are being planned around their availability.All services focus on maximising the general community good.  I am conscious of the need to ensure no displacement takes place of commercially viable existing services as a result of the introduction of the new scheme.  My intention is that the pilot scheme will be reviewed after a year and decisions in relation to its future will be informed by the outcome of the evaluation.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The Minister has said there is no night time service in many rural areas.  There is, in fact, no day service in many rural areas.  I welcome this initiative.  The Government gave an election commitment that this issue would receive priority if it was returned to office.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is engaged in discussions with the HSE.  We have a serious problem in that there is no public transport service in many parts of rural Ireland.  The Government is focused on bringing services to the regions.  However, many people, some in receipt of social welfare payments of only €189 or €200 per week, are unable to attend hospital appointments because of a lack of transport.  They are given appointments in hospitals in Galway and north Mayo, some 140 miles away.  They would be required to spend their total social welfare payment on a taxi to attend these appointments.I have a meeting tomorrow with representatives of the HSE from which I received a letter last week stating it was engaged in discussions on the issue with the Minister and his Department.  Perhaps he will outline for us what is happening.  Can he assure the people concerned that he will put in place transport services to bring them to hospital appointments?  A case is before the Ombudsman of a woman in serious ill-health who has not taken up a hospital appointment in a full year.

I was a little taken aback when the HSE stated my Department and I were engaged in discussions with it.  I have discussed the matter with a senior executive of the HSE and a local transport group in an effort to identify how best we can bring together, in a co-ordinated fashion, the critical mass of the rural transport initiative and the requirement to bring people to hospital.  If this can be done, we will get better value for money.I have tried to pursue the issue with the HSE which has an allocation to provide this type of ambulance service.  We could provide a much more extensive service if this was linked to a joint bidding system through the rural transport initiative.  We are involved in a cohesive process, including Leader and partnership companies.  This is about providing cohesive, comprehensive services; it is not about structures, but about people.  We must examine their needs, including for patient transport which is vital.I concur with the Deputy's remarks on this issue.  I was appalled to learn that people from Inishturk and Clare Island who do not have cars on the mainland were being told once they arrived on the mainland that they had to walk or take a taxi to hospital.  While I am working on the issue, progress has been slow.  I appreciate the Deputy's support for my efforts.  I would be interested to hear his view on whether this is the best way to approach the matter.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I am glad to hear the Minister's response.  I know he is committed to rural Ireland.  I do not mind who provides the service.  I will have a meeting with officials from the HSE tomorrow.  Some believe it is important to have vehicles equipped with the best of mobile phones and seats to transport them around the country, while others awaiting major heart surgery, some in receipt of social welfare payments of €189 or €200 per week, do not have transport to take them to hospital.  I do not mind whether the service is provided under the rural transport scheme or by the HSE.  If the HSE cannot do it, I will support the Minister and his Department in their efforts to provide a service.  The HSE should not remove the existing service until a new one is in place.  I am asking that the Minister discuss the matter with the HSE to ensure patients will obtain transport to take up hospital appointments.

The HSE cut the service to the limit, leaving many in my constituency and others without a service.  I approached the HSE about this matter a considerable time ago and the officials said they were sticking to their statement that they could only provide a limited service.  I pointed out that I am always amazed that the HSE can make cutbacks but the amount saved is only a drop in the ocean compared to its total budget.  I asked them to consider, as an alternative way of approaching this issue, giving the money to the existing providers so that money is not wasted on bureaucracy.  In other words, another bureaucracy should not be set up.  We have an existing structure and, therefore, no money should be expended on bureaucracy.  I asked them to consider providing a lump sum in return for services and allow the providers to tender out the services as part of their own.  The officials said they would consider it but they have not returned with proposals.  I am pursuing the issue and the Deputy can rest assured that I will try to progress this in the way we have discussed.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The Government is well aware of the threat from drug trafficking associated with coastal areas and I am satisfied that the relevant authorities — the Customs and Excise Service of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda, supported as appropriate by the Irish Naval Service — are addressing the issues in a co-ordinated and integrated way.  In addition, the response required to tackle this issue is kept under ongoing review.  It is generally accepted the most appropriate response is an intelligence-led approach, which optimises the opportunity for intelligence sharing.  In that regard, the Deputy should note the imminent setting up of a seven-nation Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre-Narcotics, MAOC-N, based in Lisbon.  It is expected that the formal signing of the MAOC-N treaty, which was formally approved by Cabinet yesterday, will take place at the end of this month.  This will facilitate the integration of intelligence across the seven nations involved — Ireland, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal — and it will further involve close co-operation with the United States.  At the same time, it must be acknowledged, however, that it will never be feasible to seal our entire long and often lightly populated coastline and the risk of drugs being landed will persist in Ireland, as happens in other countries with extensive coastlines.With respect to seizures, both the Garda and the Customs and Excise report significant increases in the volume and number of seizures over the lifetime of the national drugs strategy and all supply reduction performance indicators adopted for the strategy have been exceeded, or are well in the course of being met.  With regard to the overall issue of ensuring a co-ordinated and integrated response to tackling the drugs problem, I chair the interdepartmental group on drugs, which meets quarterly to oversee the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  Overall, and particularly in the light of a recent wide-ranging meeting of the group, I am satisfied that good progress is being made across the five pillars of the strategy in a co-ordinated way.Tackling the problem of drugs misuse is a key priority for Government and will continue to be so.  This commitment is evidenced by the ongoing increased funding in my Department's Vote.  The allocation of €50 million this year represents an increase of 16% on the 2006 figure and is 87% up on the corresponding figure for 2004.  I assure the Deputy that I am determined to ensure that adequate resources will continue to be provided in the coming years.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Deputy should also note that a total of more than €200 million was expended on various drugs programmes across Departments and agencies last year.  This figure is exclusive of the many mainstream services that are availed of in the normal way by those affected by problem drug use.  Furthermore, the programme for Government commits to implementing the recommendations of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, developing and strengthening the range of projects undertaken by drugs task forces, continuing the operation of the young people's facilities and services fund and expanding its coverage to further towns and providing more cocaine-specific treatment facilities  Overall, huge efforts are being made from the ground up to tackle the ongoing problems of drug misuse in an ever-evolving global situation.  I acknowledge that much remains to be done to continue to tackle the problem, as is the case in all developed countries, but I believe that significant success has been achieved in reducing the hardship caused to individuals, families, communities and society at large.

Earlier, a person who was out walking the dog returned with a significant consignment of drugs.  This is a serious issue.  The agencies are only recovering a small amount of the drugs entering the State.  Recently, I was holding a clinic in Belmullet and I heard Customs and Excise officials were in the area.  I decided to visit them.

That is not acceptable and it is time the Minister of State's Department and the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform got together.  For example, the number of gardaí in the Garda national drugs unit has been reduced.  We must be serious about finding drugs and ensuring narcotics do not enter the State.  We must secure the regional airports and the coastline as we cannot let these drugs into the country to destroy our communities and the youth.  They are being sold openly in this country having been brought from mainland England and elsewhere.The Government must put more resources into Customs and Excise and the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform in order to man our coastlines.  Criminals are bringing drugs in because they are sophisticated.  They have boats and when the drugs are landed, the criminals can locate them.  The State must get resources as well.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	511	In recent weeks Garda authorities have increased the number of gardaí assigned to drug intervention issues.  The interagency approach which is key to all of this is being constantly monitored.  In the last number of weeks I have had a number of meetings to ensure the interagency approach is beefed up, for want of a better term.I had an interesting meeting in July with a group largely representing fishermen from the Howth area.  They represented fishermen from Arklow up to the Balbriggan and Drogheda areas.  Customs authorities are looking at a pilot project which would engage the coastal communities in supporting intelligence-led, community-based interventions.  With such an indented coastline, there is very little chance that every single cove can be monitored so the commitment of the coastal communities is very valuable and the authorities acknowledge their ongoing support.This can be built upon and with the new satellite and tracking technology available now, co-operation between the fishing and leisure industries and the statutory authorities could lead to significant further progress.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 15 and 22 together.In its report on the national countryside recreation strategy, Comhairle na Tuaithe made recommendations.  These were that the Attorney General be requested to examine restating and reflecting in legislation the current common law position regarding the protection of landowners' property rights where recreational access is allowed on their land; that the Law Reform Commission be requested to make recommendations on the broader issues of access to the countryside for recreational users, focusing on the constitutional and legal position pertaining in Ireland; and that Comhairle na Tuaithe considered that no cost burden or liability, within the meaning of the Occupiers Liability Act 1995, should attach to farmers or landowners as a result of allowing recreational users on their land.To ensure these issues were addressed as a matter of priority, I established an expert group and asked that it report to me by 30 April.  Due to the short timeframe available to the expert group, I requested it to initially consider issues in three broad areas.  These are indemnity and addressing the insurance issue; constitutional issues on right to roam law and whether farmers would have to be compensated, with a preliminary view as to whether the right to roam could confer wider access rights; and bare licence, specifically whether it should be put on a formal statutory basis.I received the report in early May and members of Comhairle na Tuaithe were given until the end of August to put forward their comments and observations.  The comments received are now being examined by my Department.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.As the Deputies are aware, the report is an objective legal opinion or legal advice.  It is a report of legal experts but every legal opinion is subject to what a court would decide.  It is very useful in that regard, but it should be remembered that is not a policy proposal.  It sets out legal possibilities and informs our options for the future.It appears there are two ways to address the issue of countryside recreation — either through legislation or through community agreement.  I have always made clear my view that an agreed community approach offers a win-win situation for everyone with an interest in countryside recreation.  Everyone in Comhairle na Tuaithe seems to be in agreement on the need for the protection of landholders and the need for reasonable access.  There is a significant consensus within comhairle on preparing a scheme for the development and maintenance of agreed walks and work on the framework of this scheme is currently ongoing in my Department, in full consultation with Comhairle na Tuaithe.Arising from my consideration of the national countryside recreation strategy, and in addition to establishing the expert group, I have also taken a number of other initiatives.  For example, agreement has been reached with Fáilte Ireland for the employment of 11 rural recreation officers to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.  These officers will act as a contact person for walking tourists and provide a wide range of support and advice.  I announced the locations of these officers at the Ploughing Championship this week.In addition, an amount of €600,000 was made available by my Department to Fáilte Ireland in 2006 for capital work on looped walks.  A further €1.5 million has been made available in 2007.  Some €90,000, or €30,000 per annum over three years starting in 2006, has been allocated to Wicklow Uplands Council and Wicklow Rural Partnership to develop a network of access routes over private lands in areas of high scenic and amenity value in County Wicklow.A branch of Leave No Trace was established in Ireland in 2006 and my Department supported that organisation by allocating €30,000 towards the employment of a strategic co-ordinator.  The co-ordinator is involved in actively promoting the Leave No Trace message among the many countryside recreation groups around the country.  Funding has also been made available to Great Southern Trail, GST, to upgrade a section of the existing walking trail to cycling standard.  GST is a non-profit voluntary group working to develop the abandoned Limerick to Tralee railway line so that the region can be explored in a safe, leisurely way by foot or bicycle.My Department has had meetings with Iarnród Éireann regarding the use of its abandoned railway lines for recreation purposes and with Coillte on the provision of countryside recreation amenities.  In a similar vein, I have met with Bord na Móna to discuss the possibility that some of their lands could be used for recreational purposes.I assure Deputies that I recognise the commitment of Comhairle na Tuaithe's members to developing countryside recreation and it is my clear intention to continue working with them to find the best way forward.

Does he concur that some form of legislation, for which he will have responsibility during the next few years of this House, will be the basis upon which a consensus can be consolidated?  Without some legal basis, whatever shape it may take, we will not make progress, as one individual out of 20 will retain a veto.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I do not accept fully that one individual out of 20 will maintain a veto.  The way this is bubbling from the ground up is that the vast majority of communities are now becoming involved in the whole walkways concept.  They are coming to us having created walkways.  These are rural communities, made up of farmers and others, coming forward with great ideas and driving the concept.  That is the way to have it.Three issues are coming forward constantly regarding legislation.  These are the approach being taken by the ICMSA, that we must regularise the case of bare licence, which I understand is a common law provision.  This approach maintains there should be a clear statement in law that no matter how often somebody walks across land, they get no proprietary rights.Another approach is from the perspective of right to roam.  This is similar to the cases of England and Scotland.  We had very interesting discussions when I visited New Zealand two years ago in that regard.  The scenario is not the same but that country has much private land adjacent to cities which is walked on.  I have papers and discussion documents from those meetings, which were very helpful.  The view expressed was that in their history, a right to roam law across private land would not solve anything.  New Zealand is considered to be one of the best countries in the world in terms of rural recreation.I am basically taking a twin-track approach.  There are many ideas which everyone agrees upon and most rural communities wish to see rural recreation.  We should get ahead in that regard.  We have slowly and carefully been building up the consensus.  I have an open mind about looking at legislative issues, without any indication at this stage as to where it might lead.  My gut reaction from the very beginning has been that, in view of our history, a right to roam law as it is in England or Scotland will not work.  I remain to be convinced it would lead us anywhere other than further acrimony.On the other hand I have been clear about two other factors, which I wish to emphasise.  If a significant amount of farmers would suddenly refuse people permission to walk the hills of Ireland, my view would probably change very fast.  I have always maintained that view.  I am working on the basis we can get a good, broad and voluntary agreement.  I hope the rural recreation officers do much good in that regard.I am not willing, on behalf of the State, to commit the State's money to right to access.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I apologise for being a little late.  I was confused about the timing as a result of all the votes.With the current turmoil in the financial markets, it is now a matter of urgency that a reformed compensation scheme for depositors and savers with banks should be put in place.  We have seen a number of banks experiencing severe financial difficulties in recent weeks and people would have witnessed depositors and savers in Northern Rock queuing outside the bank's headquarters.  In Ireland, if the bank was to fail utterly, the maximum compensation currently available to savers and depositors is extremely low.  It equates to 90% of savings, with a maximum limit of €20,000.Despite the introduction of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, this particular area has yet to be reformed.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer recently announced that the UK system was to be reformed, with the Bank of England and the UK Treasury offering high levels of guarantees to savers and depositors.  Northern Rock is an on-line bank without a bank structure here, so it became very difficult for customers to make phone and e-mail contact with the bank in the early days of the panic.The Minister for Finance must put in place appropriate structures that will protect the integrity of the banking system and bank customers.  The integrity of the banking system is fundamental to our economic well-being.  Problems in the global credit market will, in turn, impact on those who wish to purchase houses, start businesses or simply ensure that their savings are secure.  To date, the Minister for Finance has been astonishingly silent in respect of these issues.  There has been no opportunity for any form of Dáil debate, not even at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which the Government has not bothered to re-establish since the general election.The people have a right to know if the Minister for Finance has his eye on the ball in respect of these key issues.  He simply cannot hide behind the Financial Regulator.  I want the Minister to make an honest statement, setting out clearly the likely impact of the turmoil in the financial markets on the banking sector, in particular, and the economy in general.  What response, if any, does he propose to make as regards the clear risks involved for Irish savers and businesses as a result of recent events?  Financial services have been a key component of growth in the economy during the past decade.  Any difficulties experienced by this sector will, therefore, have a knock-on effect elsewhere.The Financial Regulator must clearly outline the protections that are in place or indicate the structures that need to be revised in order to protect the customers of banks and credit unions.  A full analysis must be made of the sub-prime market in Ireland, both in terms of investments by Irish banks and credit unions in financial derivatives and other new financial products.  In addition, there is a need to produce a profile of the lending activities of sub-prime lenders in the economy.  I am concerned that a number of such lenders are taking unacceptable risks as regards some of the lending in which they are engaged.  The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service should be immediately re-established to examine these issues in public.I want to be assured that the Minister is sending out a clear message that cowboys and unacceptable lending practices on the part of financial institutions in Ireland will not be tolerated.  On previous occasions I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, the fact that the representatives of sub-prime lenders are calling door to door in local authority housing estates and in areas where people have purchased affordable housing and are offering to roll-up all their debts, including car and holiday loans.  They are also placing inflated values on these people's homes and giving some of them more than 100% mortgages.  Mr. Des Geraghty, chairman of the affordable housing partnership, recently and correctly stated that this type of behaviour, as it relates to lending, is insane.  If the individuals involved default on their new loans, the level of charges and penalties imposed by sub-prime lenders means that many of them stand to lose their homes.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The first and most important point I wish to make on behalf of the Tánaiste in responding to these issues is to highlight the importance of a well capitalised and soundly regulated banking system in underpinning the safety and security of savings, particularly in situations of financial uncertainty.  Ireland has an excellent regulatory regime and a very solid banking system.  The recently published IMF report on the Irish economy concluded that the Irish banking system is well capitalised, profitable and liquid.  It also noted that the Central Bank is satisfied that major lenders here have adequate resources to cover a range of potential shocks.As far as the effectiveness of the Irish regulatory system is concerned, the House will be aware that financial regulation here is based on a comprehensive and detailed EU template and conforms to international standards of best practice.  The IMF report to which I refer explicitly acknowledged the strengthening of the financial regulatory and supervisory system in Ireland in recent years.  In terms of the response to the change in financial market conditions, the Financial Regulator has said on a number of occasions that it has increased its ongoing dialogue focusing on recent financial market developments with other regulators and regulated entities in Ireland.Major progress has been made in strengthening consumer protection in the financial area.  The consumer director of the Financial Regulator has an explicit mandate to protect the interests of consumers.  The introduction of the consumer protection code represents significant progress in that regard.  The Tánaiste has already announced his intention to bring forward legislative proposals during the current Dáil session to ensure that all consumer lending, including what is described as sub-prime lending, will be subject to the consumer protection code.  The debate on that legislation will present an opportunity to discuss this matter and to reign in those cowboys, if they exist, to which the Deputy refers.In reviewing recent events affecting Northern Rock, it is important to state that the branch structure under which it operates in Ireland places responsibility for the overall prudential supervision of the bank with the UK authorities under EU law.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The UK authorities have made it clear that Northern Rock is solvent, exceeds its regulatory capital requirement and has a good quality loan book.  The UK Chancellor's statement that all deposits are safe was obviously welcome and was successful in reassuring savers in Northern Rock, including those in Ireland.  The Tánaiste would note that the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, CBFSAI, operates within the overall context of the euro system and the European Central Bank.It is obvious that there are important lessons to be learned from all of this, including the effectiveness of deposit protection arrangements across the EU.  The European Commission recently concluded a review of the deposit protection schemes directive, which sets the framework for national schemes in the EU.  It will be necessary to re-examine this work and, in light of recent developments, to ensure that deposit guarantees strike the right balance between protecting depositors and seeing to it that banks are not encouraged to take inappropriate risks.  If the system provides total protection, banks will not be encouraged to play ball and be responsible.The performance of the global economy will be an important factor in restoring confidence among investors and in financial markets.  In that regard, growth internationally remains relatively robust despite continued uncertainty in financial markets.  As far as the national picture is concerned, prospects for the economy are very favourable by international standards.  A clear focus on our competitiveness and on a prudent and responsible approach in respect of the public finances will contribute in that regard.I assure the Deputy that the Tánaiste has his eye on the ball.  The proposed legislation to which I refer will provide us with the opportunity to debate this matter.  When I held my previous portfolio, I spoke on many occasions about financial institutions, one to two years ago, being over-generous as regards mortgages.  At the time, I did not receive a great deal of support.  Some people in the media and elsewhere rubbished what I had to say.  Many individuals could see that a problem was coming down the tracks.  It is fine to give a 100% mortgage to someone who has major potential and who has left college to take up an extremely lucrative career.  However, some people were handing out leaflets relating to lending on Grafton Street as if they were advertising pizzas for lunch.  Some irresponsible lending activities were engaged in.  The Tánaiste's proposed legislation will provide us with ample opportunity to discuss this matter.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I wish to share time with Deputy Terence Flanagan.Cystic fibrosis is a serious illness and one in 19 people are carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene.  Where two parents with the gene marry, there is a one in four chance that their child will be born with the condition.  Each year, 40 to 50 children are born with cystic fibrosis and there are currently in the region of 1,200 people who suffer with it.  The disturbing aspect of this matter is that, on average, people in this country with cystic fibrosis live ten years less than those who reside in the UK or Northern Ireland.  This is because we do not have proper neonatal screening so we can detect people with this problem early on and prevent infections, we do not have proper home care supports and, most importantly, we do not have any isolation units in our hospitals.  Neither Temple Street Children's Hospital nor Beaumont Hospital on the north of the city have these facilities for children or adults.  A total of 80% of adult sufferers are treated in either St. Vincent's Hospital or Cork University Hospital, neither of which has isolation facilities.We know we need a 34-bed unit, which we hope will be built in St. Vincent's Hospital, but when will it be built?  The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Department of Health and Children met with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, which has received assurances.  However, it is still no further down the line.  Even though €4.78 million was allocated, I understand that many people have not been employed due to contractual difficulties.  We still have the glaring problem of the lack of isolation beds in our system.  It cannot be that expensive to build these beds on to existing hospital structures.  This cannot be yet another situation where we are asked to live horse and eat hay.  People need these facilities now.  People in our country are dying ten years sooner than they need to purely because of the lack of this simple measure which a Government should put in place immediately.  I ask the Government to do so.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I thank Deputy Reilly for the opportunity to speak about cystic fibrosis and the lack of services for sufferers in Ireland.  As a Deputy representing Dublin North-East, I am very aware of this issue.  During the general election campaign, many members of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland actively campaigned on this issue and brought it to my attention.  I thank those people and commend them for their good work.As Deputy Reilly noted, with 1,200 or so patients in Ireland, we have the highest proportion of people with cystic fibrosis in the world.  This is totally unacceptable.  Life expectancy for sufferers is significantly lower in Ireland than in Northern Ireland and the UK.  One might ask this Minister why this should be the case.  As Deputy Reilly noted, there is a severe lack of neonatal screening, home care and supports for sufferers and families, and isolation beds for sufferers of the disease.  Medical cards are not available to young sufferers of the disease who deserve them.All this could be changed overnight if the Minister for Health and Children had the political will to deliver proper cystic fibrosis services.  Fine Gael recognises the serious deficiencies in services for cystic fibrosis sufferers in Ireland and the difficulties they are faced with on a daily basis.  We deplore the fact that the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients in the Republic of Ireland is lower than in the North of Ireland.At a time of unprecedented economic success, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats failed to implement the recommendations of the Pollock report.  Funding was set aside in the 2006 budget for the recruitment of 57 additional specialist staff.  Can the Minister confirm if they have been recruited?  Are they another victim of the Minister's cutbacks, recruitment ban and other barriers?  Have more nurses been appointed?Fine Gael is acutely aware of the dangers posed to sufferers of cystic fibrosis by waiting in overcrowded accident and emergency departments, the spread of hospital acquired infections and the lack of isolation facilities.  We on this side of the House are tired of Fianna Fáil inaction which continues to put people's lives at risk.  Fine Gael's main priority, which should also be that of the Minister, is to see that cystic fibrosis sufferers benefit from world class treatment so they can lead more productive, active and healthy lifestyles.

I will be taking the Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.  The Minister has identified the enhancement of services to persons with cystic fibrosis as a key priority.  Indeed, the Minister, along with the Taoiseach, met with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland earlier this month to review the progress that has been made in improving services for persons with cystic fibrosis over the past two years and to discuss the need in particular to improve the infrastructure within which these services are provided.Additional revenue funding of nearly €7 million was provided over the past two years to develop services for persons with cystic fibrosis.  This funding was provided to facilitate the recruitment of additional consultant, nursing and allied health professional staff and to improve services nationally.  The HSE has advised me that each of its networks was given notification of the specific funding available for their areas and the specific posts associated with the funding.  The HSE has informed the Department that 39 additional posts are now in place.The HSE was also asked to address, in particular, the identified infrastructural and service deficits at the national adult referral centre at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.  In this context, additional revenue funding of €300,000 was provided to the hospital in 2005 and an additional €1 million was provided in 2006 to facilitate the recruitment of additional medical, nursing and allied health professional staff.The new ambulatory day care centre, which is part of a €203 million investment at the hospital, includes specialist clinic facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.  In addition, the new emergency department allows for increased isolation capacity at the hospital.  This is frequently utilised by persons with cystic fibrosis.Interim refurbishment of facilities for cystic fibrosis patients has recently been completed at the hospital and comprises the re-designation of 15 beds as respiratory-cystic fibrosis beds, bringing the total number of respiratory-cystic fibrosis beds to 44.A project team has been appointed to progress the next phase of development at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  This team includes representatives of both the hospital and the HSE.  It is intended that this development will include the provision of dedicated facilities for patients with cystic fibrosis.  These facilities will provide, in particular, private single room accommodation with en-suite bathrooms for inpatients, together with appropriate isolation facilities for patients who require it.  In addition, the project team is giving consideration to such issues as the need for separate access routes to the unit.In addition to the infrastructural developments to be carried out at St. Vincent's University Hospital, the HSE is also considering the need for additional infrastructural improvements at Cork and Galway university hospitals.In respect of cystic fibrosis services for children, a new outpatient clinic called the Medical Tower opened at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in 2005.  This has considerably improved the facilities available to treat the large number of children with cystic fibrosis attending the hospital.

It employs 256 people in the manufacturing process and also has a very significant service industry employing approximately 120 people.  So it is a critical industry.  It provides the best standard of employment anywhere in the country.  Coca-Cola is the best employer with a very dedicated workforce that has had a tremendous relationship with the town of Drogheda, the community and the workers.All of this is changing with the proposal by the company to close the manufacturing facility with the loss of 256 jobs.  I want to address this issue from the perspective of the workers and how the effect of this appalling closure on their lives and the entire community can be mitigated.  What steps will the Minister take?  The workers believe that parts of the operation can be saved and that manufacturing jobs in some sections can continue.The workers are willing to look at current work practices.  Will the Minister facilitate an effort to save these jobs and, if so, how?  In particular, will he ask the IDA in the north east and the US to work with the unions and workers to progress this issue?  Such a commitment is required immediately.  I welcome the planned meeting between the trade unions and the Minister on 11 October but I fear it may be too late.  We must act now.The loss of these jobs in Drogheda, coupled with other job losses in the local manufacturing and industrial sector, will be significant.  While I welcome the establishment of a task force, a strategic plan to acquire more manufacturing bases in counties Louth and Meath is needed.  Drogheda has a population of 35,000 people, but the area will have about 70,000 people in ten years. Will the Minister raise with the Minister for Finance the introduction of tax incentives for the planned development of the dockland area in Drogheda?Coca-Cola is a welcome employer in Drogheda and all concerned wish to see it continue in the town.  We need to see action from the Minister and others, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to ensure further job creation in Drogheda.

The company had decided it no longer needed three operations in Ireland.  The reason given for closing the Drogheda plant was that the high-capacity plant in Ballina, County Mayo and the specialised plant in Athy, County Kildare had sufficient capacity to meet future demand.  A number of employees affected will have the option of moving to either Athy or Ballina, where job numbers will be increased by 90 between the two plants, thereby reducing the overall number of job losses.Shared services jobs will remain in Drogheda where the company will continue to employ 112 people.  The company has been keen to stress it is committed to supporting its employees through a generous redundancy package, re-training and business start-up assistance where appropriate.  The services of the Government training agency, FÁS, are also available to those workers who wish to avail of the agency's services.The Government is determined to provide every assistance possible to the redundant workers so they can seek alternative employment.  The company identified that future concentrate requirements can be met by consolidating its current number of plants.  However, the company will continue to employ over 500 people in Ireland.  Over the years, the company has enjoyed a warm relationship with the people of Drogheda and other businesses in the town and the company will continue to play an active role in the community.While the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is abroad on an Enterprise Ireland trade mission, he has already agreed to meet with Drogheda Borough Council on 11 October.  The industrial development agencies have been promoting Drogheda and County Louth for industrial development as per Government policy.  There have been several significant developments recently both in the town and the county.  In January 2007, Daiwa Securities Global Asset Services opened a hedge fund administration operation for Daiwa Securities Group Inc. in Dundalk.  The Dundalk operation will create 300 high calibre financial services jobs.  In April 2006, it was announced that Becton, Dickinson and Company will invest €52 million, with the support of Government funding through IDA Ireland, in the development and expansion of its medical devices global manufacturing centre in Drogheda.  This is expected to create an additional 125 new jobs over and above the current employment in Drogheda of 95 people.In March 2006, it was announced that Pillar Data Systems Inc., of San Jose, California, supported by IDA Ireland, is to establish its European, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Drogheda.  Pillar Data Systems designs and builds computer data storage systems.  The new operation for Drogheda will have sole management responsibility for sales and marketing, technical support, finance, operations, IT management and business analysis in the European, Middle East and Africa regions.  It will create 200 high calibre jobs across these business areas.  In February 2006, it was announced the Vesta Corporation, a leader in virtual commerce solutions, is to establish a European operations centre in Dundalk.  This centre will create 350 high quality jobs over three years.IDA Ireland recently completed the €6 million site development programme at its Drogheda business park.  The first building on the park comprising 23,000 square feet has been occupied by International Funds Services which employs 125 people.  In addition to these recent positive developments which I have outlined, the industrial development agencies will continue to promote Drogheda and the surrounding area for further industrial development.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	528	On 1 August 2007, Derek Cumiskey was killed in Lanzarote.  He had turned 18 years of age two weeks prior to his murder.  He was a well-liked student at St. Augustine's in Blackrock, County Dublin and lived nearby in Townsend Street.  He had just completed his junior certificate and had been selected as student of the year at his school.  He celebrated this achievement by going on holiday to Puerto del Carmen with friends and his sister, Joanne.Since his murder on 1 August, the Cumiskey family has received consular assistance from the consulate in Lanzarote but no legal aid or representation.  As a result, they feel like intruders in the investigative process instead of being kept up-to-date with the investigation.  In September, the investigating judge indicated the process would be kept confidential for a further month and any objections would have to be lodged within three days.  However, the Cumiskey family was not made aware of this development until ten days afterwards.  It should not be beyond us to provide more assistance to families when a loved one dies abroad.According to the CSO the number of trips abroad by Irish citizens between April and June 2007 was 2,048,000, an increase of 12% on the corresponding period in 2006.  People who used to travel once a year are now going abroad two or three times.  The increased incidence of travel has also seen an increase in the number of fatalities of citizens abroad, which puts pressure on the Department of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance in such cases.  When the recent airplane crash in Thailand occurred, it was inevitable Irish holidaymakers would be involved.  I extend my sympathies to the family of Aaron Toland, a young man from Derry.The number of Irish people travelling to the Canary Islands is now higher than the number travelling to the United States.  It is imperative that consular and legal assistance should be improved.  The Cumiskeys would have legal aid if the event had occurred in Ireland but because it took place in another jurisdiction, the family has received no legal briefing other than information from the consulate.  The tragic case of Derek Cumiskey brings into focus the issues faced by those whose family members are murdered abroad.  I understand the number of such cases is small.  My office requested the figures for the number of citizens murdered abroad each year from the Department of Foreign Affairs but I am still awaiting the figures.A reciprocal aid system is already in place in EU member states.  Council directive 2002/8 to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes establishes minimum common rules relating to legal aid.  The issue of legal aid and how Irish citizens access it abroad appears to be very unclear.  Issues need to be addressed as regards two measures by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is not clear which Department is ultimately responsible.  First, if there is a reciprocal arrangement between Ireland and other countries to provide legal supports for those Irish citizens who require it, why did the Cumiskeys and families in similar positions not have this information made available automatically?  Second, if arrangements are not in place to ensure that families of murder victims have the information they need, then clearly a facility or fund needs to be put in place to allow such families access to legal aid when it is required.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	529	On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I thank Deputy Chris Andrews for raising this very important issue.  In addition to addressing the issue in general terms here today, the Minister has recently responded to the Deputy's correspondence regarding the specific case of the family of Mr. Derek Cumiskey who died tragically in Lanzarote last month.  As the Deputy will be aware, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in his capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has no role as such in assisting Irish nationals who encounter difficulties while abroad.  The Department of Foreign Affairs provides this assistance through its network of embassies and consulates overseas.There are now millions of instances of Irish citizens travelling abroad every year and as this number grows, so also does the need for consular assistance and support.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has responded well to this challenge and I understand that the overwhelming feedback it receives is positive.  Often the difficulty encountered will be temporary or minor, but we all appreciate that Irish citizens can also find themselves in serious difficulty.  The most tragic of the circumstances where consular assistance is called upon is, of course, where an Irish citizen dies suddenly, whether accidentally or in suspicious circumstances.  In such cases, and in all deaths of Irish citizens abroad, the Department of Foreign Affairs provides extensive assistance and support including, where necessary, assistance with autopsies, death certificates and liaison with undertakers and airlines.Embassies can provide general information with respect to the national legal system of the country in question, the procedures followed in investigating crime and any arrangements that apply for the next-of-kin of victims in a particular legal system.  Lists of local lawyers are also available but embassies do not provide or pay for legal advice.In so far as support from Irish legal aid arrangements is concerned, such aid in Ireland is primarily delivered via the civil and criminal legal aid schemes.  Both schemes are established under their respective legislation setting out the eligibility criteria for aid under the particular scheme.  Neither scheme provides for representation for the next-of-kin of victims during the course of an investigation or prosecution or for representation to Irish nationals involved in legal proceedings taking place wholly outside the State.The Minister has great sympathy for the Cumiskey family, as I do, and on foot of representations from their solicitor and from Deputy Andrews, he has considered carefully the possibility of making some type of ex gratia legal aid payment to the family.  He has, however, concluded that to provide aid in these circumstances would go too far beyond what is envisaged under Irish legal aid arrangements and lead to an expectation on the part of the many other Irish nationals who become involved in legal proceedings while abroad that their cases should also be covered by the Irish legal aid schemes.  This was never the intention of those schemes.The Department is, however, making inquiries regarding Spanish legal aid arrangements and will pass on any information it receives.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue, of course, to provide all possible consular assistance to the family.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 13 together.The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 has achieved considerable success across a range of areas in reducing the hardship caused to individuals and society by problem drug use.Under the Strategy, the Government continues to address problem drug use in a co-ordinated way through the original four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. These have been augmented, following the mid-term review of the Strategy in 2005, by the fifth pillar regarding rehabilitation.In particular, the Deputy should note that:the level of drugs seizures by the Gardaí and the Customs Service have been well in excess of the targets set out in the Strategy and they include a number of significant operations;under the prevention pillar, the SPHE and Walk Tall programmes have been rolled out to all schools; awareness campaigns have been organised and tremendous achievements have been made under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF);treatment facilities have increased significantly, with approximately 8,500 in receipt of methadone in July, and a range of services are being provided across the statutory, voluntary and community sectors for various types of problem drug use; andresearch in areas such as drugs prevalence, the outcome of heroin treatment, families and drugs, the effect of drugs on communities and cocaine issues have all helped to inform our progress.The specific achievements of my own Department under the Strategy include the programmes developed by Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces, capital projects developed under the Premises Initiative Fund and preventative actions undertaken through the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund.The 14 Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) are well established, having been in operation for nearly 10 years now.  At this stage, over 440 community-based projects are being supported, employing more than 300 people and delivering a wide range of services and supports for problem drug users, their families and their broader communities.  Furthermore, through the Emerging Needs Fund, approximately €4m was allocated to 67 projects last year to ensure that the drugs problem was being combated on the ground in the most timely and flexible way.An evaluation of approximately 270 interim funded LDTF projects is currently underway and it is expected to be completed later this year.  The outcome of this evaluation will help to inform the way forward for any development and strengthening of projects at LDTF level.Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) were also established in 2003, thus ensuring that all parts of the country now benefit from the operation of a Drugs Task Force.  Following extensive consultation processes, each region prepared a Strategic Plan which are now being rolled out in the different areas.  The RDTFs will be pressing ahead towards full implementation of their plans in the coming year or two at a full cost of approx. €14m.In regard to capital funding, a Premises Initiative Fund is now open to applications from all Drug Task Forces to address the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects.  It is envisaged that RDTFs will come forward with an increased range of proposals under this Fund in the coming period.The Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund was established to assist in the development of youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The main aim of the Fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group of the programme is young people in the age range of 10 to 21 years who are defined as "at risk" due to factors such as family circumstances, educational disadvantage, or involvement in crime or substance misuse.Earlier this week, I was delighted to announce additional capital allocations of nearly €7m to support 42 projects under the Fund.  To date, allocations of just over €125m have been made to almost 500 facility & services projects in LDTF areas in Dublin Bray and Cork, as well as in Galway, Limerick and Waterford cities and Carlow town.The Government is committed to maximising the successful outcomes of the current National Drugs Strategy.  The allocation of €50m this year in my Department's Vote clearly illustrates this point.  This amount represents an increase of 16% on the 2006 figure and is 87% up on the corresponding figure for 2004.  In all, over €200m was spent on various drugs programmes across Government Departments and agencies last year.  Indeed, this figure is exclusive of the many mainstream services that are availed of, in the normal way, by those affected by problem drug use.Meanwhile, we continue to adapt our approach to drugs issues in a flexible manner to address evolving situations.  In that regard, I am overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs entitled "An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland" largely through the Inter-departmental Group on Drugs, which I chair.  In this context, the Deputy should note that significant efforts are being made at both statutory and community level to tackle that problem.Looking forward, the Programme for Government contains commitments in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, developing and strengthening the range of Drug Task Force projects, continuing and extending the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and providing cocaine specific facilities.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be working to ensure that these commitments are fulfilled.Finally, the Deputy should note that I will shortly be initiating the process that will lead to the formulation of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period post 2008.  While the challenges ahead are clearly significant, I am confident that we can build on our experiences and achievements to date in meeting them.

The matter is being examined in the overall context of the recently completed study on Irish language usage in the Gaeltacht, which was conducted on behalf of my Department by Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge, University of Ireland, Galway, in conjunction with the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis, University of Ireland, Maynooth. A Report arising from that study is being examined by my Department at present and will be presented to Government in due course. I do not anticipate making any decisions in relation to amendments to Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge until that process is completed.

At the end of 2006, 7,953 persons were employed on a full-time basis and 4,380 were employed on a part-time/seasonal basis in Údarás assisted companies.Under the current National Development Plan, funding of €233m has been earmarked for Údarás na Gaeltachta to continue its ongoing work in developing the economy of the Gaeltacht.  Sectors such as technology, natural resources and services will continue to be afforded priority, in addition to training and upskilling of the Gaeltacht workforce.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	535	As Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, I would obviously support any initiatives that would inhibit illicit drug dealing.  The widespread use of mobile phones in drug dealing is common knowledge and the problem was reinforced to me in a recent meeting with representatives of the Garda National Drugs Unit.  Furthermore, the Programme for Government contains a commitment that all mobile phones will require to be registered with name, address and proof of identity in order to stop drug pushers using untraceable, unregistered phones.However, the Department of Communications, Energy & Natural Resources in their analysis of the issue, identify a number of problems in achieving this objective.  These include the ease with which a foreign or stolen SIM card can be used, the difficulties that would be posed in verifying identity and data protection issues arising from the development of a register.I understand that the issue will be considered further by the relevant parties with a view to achieving an outcome that will be satisfactory to all involved.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	536	As the Deputy may be aware, in many rural areas, there are no public transport services at night.  While there are, in the more developed rural areas, either hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers of these services and do not provide a guaranteed service to rural people.It was against this background, therefore, that earlier this year I introduced a new evening transport service, on a pilot basis, to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities — community, sporting and social — that take place in their areas.  The new Scheme also aims to address the market failure that currently exists in this area.The 34 groups currently delivering the Rural Transport Programme — operated by the Department of Transport — were invited to submit applications to be considered under my Department's new scheme.  Following the appraisal of the proposals submitted, seven groups were selected to run the pilot Scheme, namely:West Cork Rural Transport;Avondhu Development Group in East Cork;Meath Accessible/Kilnaleck Community Cavan;County Sligo LEADER Partnership;Tumna Shannon Development Company Roscommon;Síob Teoranta Donegal; andLaois Trip.The budget for the pilot is €500,000.  The first service commenced in June and service numbers and passenger numbers are expected to increase throughout the Autumn.  Although still in the early stages, I understand that the services are being very well received by communities and passengers alike.  Early indications are that older people, people with a disability and young people are particularly enthusiastic about the new services and new activities are being planned around the availability of services.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 42 together.One of the key goals of my Department is to promote and maintain living and working populations in rural areas by helping to foster sustainable and culturally vibrant communities.  Since its establishment in 2002, my Department has been vigorously pursuing policies and programmes that seek to address the changing nature of rural communities, support their development and promote better regional balance.In the new National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013, a chapter has been dedicated to the development of the rural economy.  The chapter outlines how the Plan, within the framework of national policies and programmes, will assist the social and economic development of rural areas in the coming years.  In this context, it outlines a range of interventions — which are currently being implemented or are planned — in areas such as broadband, non-national roads, rural transport initiatives, rural water services, CLÁR, the Rural Social Scheme and LEADER/Rural Economy programmes.I might briefly set out the position in relation to the latter three schemes, which come within the remit of my Department:CLÁRUnder the NDP, the CLÁR sub-programme will be allocated in the region of €141 million for the on-going regeneration of rural areas suffering from population decline in the period 2007-2013.Rural Social SchemeSince the introduction of the Rural Social Scheme (RSS), it has become a key part of many rural communities and is very popular with both participants and local sponsors.  The Deputies should note that funding for the RSS for the period 2007-2013 is included in the NDP which clearly confirms the Government's continued and on-going commitment to the Scheme in the coming years.A key feature of the RSS is the flexibility and farmer-friendly nature of the Scheme.  One of the key characteristics that has proven attractive for many participants is the Scheme's capacity to offer flexible working arrangements that meet the needs of farming enterprises.  Allowing participants to meet their time obligations under the Scheme while not allowing their farming practices to suffer is a very important element of the Scheme's design.At present, there is provision for 2,600 participants and 130 supervisors on the Scheme and all available places have been allocated.   The number of places available on the Scheme for the coming year will be decided in the context of the annual Budgetary process.EU Rural Development programmeIn tandem with the NDP, the new EU Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 will be rolled out over the coming months.  Under the Programme, over €425m will be allocated to support LEADER-type activities.  Priorities under the new Programme will include the continued development of the rural/agri-tourism, craft and small food sectors and the delivery of the Countryside Recreation Strategy. Supports for the continued development of rural enterprise will also be a significant feature under the new Programme.Looking to the future, I believe that the signs are very encouraging for rural communities. As well as the funding that I have just outlined, the implementation of the National Spatial Strategy over the coming years will, I believe, also have a significant positive impact on the development of rural communities.

The new Programme will see over €425m in funding for Axis 3 (improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity) and Axis 4 (LEADER) of the Programme delivered through a number of area-based Local Action Groups (LAGs).Prospective LAGs will shortly be asked to submit their business plans which will be evaluated by independent assessors.  It is hoped to start the delivery of the Programme, at a local level, in Spring 2008.The measures to be funded under the new Programme include the following:Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families;Support business creation and development;Encouragement of tourism activities;Basic services for economic and rural population;Village renewal and development;Conservation and upgrading of rural heritage;Training and information; andAdapted and new skills.

A further €62.4m has been allocated to support the Early Intervention Programme for Children and the Rural Social Scheme.Initially decisions on the disbursements of funds from dormant accounts were a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.  Under the initial round of funding in 2003 and 2004, the Board approved 521 projects for funding totalling over €60 million.  Details of these individual grants and organisations are available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, decisions on disbursements are made since 2006 by Government following a transparent process.  The following table summarises the €65 million allocations approved by Government since the beginning of 2006.  Details of the individual grants and organisations are available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	540	One of the main recommendations arising from the Mid-term Review of the National Drugs Strategy (NDS), was that rehabilitation should become its fifth pillar.In this context, a Working Group, chaired by my Department and involving representatives of all key players in the NDS, was established to examine the issues involved and to make recommendations on how best to progress the rehabilitation of recovering problem drug users. Their report was accepted by both the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs and the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in March 2007 and was subsequently published in May. I very much welcome the report and I wholeheartedly support the implementation of its recommendations.  The key recommendations focus on:an effective inter-agency approach based on a continuum of care for the individual (this will involve protocols for inter-agency working, service level agreements, enhanced case management and quality standards);an expansion of the range of treatment options (including an increased number of residential detoxification beds);building on the rehabilitative impact of Community Employment Schemes; andbroader life issues including medical support, access to employment, access to education, housing, particular issues relating to the rehabilitation of offenders, childcare, the role of families in the rehabilitation process and research.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement the recommendations in the Working Group's report.  My Department, together with the HSE and the Departments of Health & Children and Enterprise, Trade & Employment are currently taking a joint approach to ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to successfully implement the recommendations of the report.

I have arranged that a copy of this Report be forwarded to the Deputy for her information.As part of review process, four representative sample recreational facilities were specifically evaluated under the following headings:1. Strength of the Irish language in the area;2. Value for Money for the State in terms of language;3. Community benefit;4. Level of use; and5. Achievement of Department aims.The appraisal of results indicates that the scheme is achieving Departmental aims with regard to developing infrastructure and public facilities in the Gaeltacht and islands.In addition, an independent review of my Department's Gaeltacht Summer Camp Scheme has been completed and a revised scheme put into operation.

In order to assess the ongoing demand for places and to ensure that places do not remain vacant over a protracted period of time, Implementing Bodies have been encouraged to form a waiting list of suitable eligible applicants, which can then be used to fill vacancies as and when they arise.As of last Friday (21st September), there were 2,573 participants and 129 supervisors on the Scheme.  The Implementing Bodies are actively filling these vacancies and I expect that the overall number of 2,600 will again be reached in the coming weeks.  My Department monitors the situation on an ongoing basis to ensure that any vacancies arising are filled without delay.Since its introduction, the Scheme has become a key part of many rural communities and is very popular with both participants and local sponsors. The Deputy should note that funding for the RSS for the period 2007-2013 is included in the National Development Plan which clearly confirms the Government's continued and on-going commitment to the scheme in the coming years.The number of places available on the Scheme for the coming year will be decided in the context of the annual Budgetary process.

To date, over €125m has been allocated, with approximately 330 staff being supported.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue the operation of the YPFSF.  I fully endorse this decision and, indeed, from my experience on the ground and my involvement in youth work, I am strongly of the view that the YPFSF constitutes a very important part of the preventative pillar of the overall National Drugs Strategy.  I also believe that it has contributed significantly to diverting many young people away from the dangers of drug dependency by providing positive alternatives.At present, the Fund operates in Local Drug Task Force areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork, as well as Limerick, Waterford and Galway cities and Carlow town.  The Programme for Government further commits to extending the Fund to further towns, mainly in Leinster.  My Department is currently considering how best to do that and I hope to make announcements in this regard in the coming months.I am determined that the YPFSF will continue to successfully facilitate the delivery of quality services to people in the 10 to 21 years age group with the aim of ensuring that the young people involved maintain a drugs-free lifestyle.

The guidelines reflect my own view that rural housing within the confines of good planning practice is appropriate.  These guidelines are important in ensuring clarity and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy on rural housing.  I have had discussions however in relation to this matter with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

All 62 schemes are available on the website of An Coimisinéir Teanga at www.coimisineir.ie. In addition, in excess of 50 additional schemes, covering some 120 public bodies, are currently in preparation and my Department is in discussion with the public bodies concerned in relation to the completion of the process of drafting these schemes.On 14 December 2006 both the Dáil and the Seanad approved a draft of Regulations dealing with the use of the Irish and English languages by public bodies in pre-recorded oral announcements, on stationery and on signage. My Department has since carried out a further consultation exercise with all public bodies covered by the Act in relation to the draft Regulations.  I expect to be in a position to make the Regulations shortly after further discussion by the appropriate Oireachtas Committee.Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla has been established.  The Coimisinéir published his Annual Report for 2006 earlier this year.In April 2006, I made Regulations that updated the list of public bodies covered under the Act.  I intend to make further Regulations as soon as possible in order to further update the list.I have made 10 Placenames Orders to date including An tOrdú Logainmneacha (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) 2004.At my request, Foras na Gaeilge has developed an acreditation system for Irish language translators.As I have stated from the beginning, while it will not be possible to achieve everything overnight, my main objective is that improvements in the range and quality of services available through Irish will be achieved over the lifetime of a number of schemes, subject to demand.

This commitment is evidenced by the increasing levels of  funding in my Department's Vote. The allocation of €50m this year represented an increase of 16% on the 2006 figure and was an increase of 87% over the corresponding figure for 2004.In all, over 440 community-based projects are being supported through the Local Drugs Task Forces, employing more than 300 people. An amount of €8m is being provided by my Department for the implementation of Regional Drugs Task Force plans in 2007 and the full implementation of their plans will be rolled out over the coming years at a full cost of €14.2m p.a.  On top of this, all of the Task Forces can access capital funding under the Premises Initiative, established by my Department to address the needs of community based drugs projects.Earlier this week, I was delighted to announce additional capital allocations of nearly €7m to support 42 projects under the Young Peoples Facilities & Services Fund.  To date, allocations of just over €125m have been made to almost 500 facility & services projects in LDTF areas and in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow.I can assure the Deputy that I am determined to ensure that adequate resources will again be provided in the coming years so as to maintain the progress that is being made in tackling the drug problem in Ireland.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	553	The National Drug Related Death Index (NDRDI) — which is jointly funded by the Departments of Health & Children and Justice Equality & Law Reform — is being prepared at present by the Health Research Board. I am informed that a preliminary report will be made in 2008.While firm figures are not available at this time, I am aware that the Dublin County Coroner recently gave a warning about the dangers of cocaine when considering a number of deaths related to the use of the drug on one day. He cautioned that cocaine use can be lethal even in small doses, sometimes on the first time of use.I am fully aware of the threat posed by cocaine and see the implementation of the recommendations of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs report "An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland", which was published earlier this year, as being central to the response to this threat.  The report outlines 13 recommendations and these are now being followed up.  I am committed to ensuring that the recommendations are implemented and this is being pursued through the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs, which I chair.The report also highlighted the extremely high risks associated with cocaine and the physical and mental health problems that arise from its use.   As you may be aware, cocaine is particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and other substances and these messages on the real dangers associated with its use need to be continually highlighted.  The social and economic harm also needs to be stressed, not only to the users of cocaine, but also to their families and to communities that bear the brunt of the behaviour and criminal activity associated with the supply and use of cocaine.  Furthermore, the dangers associated with so-called "recreational" or "week-end" cocaine use and the glamorising of cocaine in some quarters need to be repeatedly stressed.Other initiatives sponsored by my Department in regard to the cocaine problem include the funding of four pilot projects and a training programme for service providers.  Also, under the Emerging Needs Fund, six cocaine specific projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas have been funded and support for a further nine projects aimed at polydrug/cocaine use has been provided under that Fund.The challenges posed by cocaine use are significant, but I am confident that we can meet these challenges through a co-ordinated approach utilising the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.

We discussed issues of mutual interest in the areas of rural development, rural recreation and the EU Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, which will bring significant financial benefits to the island of Ireland.We also discussed the positive work already undertaken by our two Departments and considered further opportunities for co-operation.  As both North and South face common challenges in rural areas, the meeting provided an opportunity to foster closer working relationships on how best we can jointly address these challenges.  It also provided an opportunity to consider how to further develop and deepen co-operation in the future.There have been many positive examples of the two Departments working together, in particular through the current INTERREG and LEADER Programmes.  This cross border co-operation has supported the creation of new industries and jobs in the Border areas.  I am confident that this co-operation will continue in the future in order to address a range of issues facing our rural communities.

To meet that objective, Foras na Gaeilge provides a range of resources and supports to parents who raise their children through Irish. These include:Gaschaint, a booklet and CD of useful phrases and sentences for parents;a package of teaching resources for Irish language medium schools, Séidean Sí, of which specific elements are aimed at parents, for example, booklets suitable for reading to young children; anda series of CDs, publication of which commenced last year and will continue next year, to accompany children's booklets for which there has been most demand.  The concept is to encourage parents to read aloud with their children and thereby assist the child in mastery of both the oral and written language.Foras na Gaeilge also provides financial support for voluntary Irish language organisations that support Irish-speaking families, as well as a wide range of community-based initiatives and services that operate through the medium of Irish and support its use in daily life.

The feasibility study was carried out by Saltire Management Ltd, a marine consultancy firm from Scotland, which has extensive experience in this sector.  Amongst the main findings it was noted that:the Aran Islands are well served in respect of passenger services;the present cargo service is well run, given the available vessels and the constraints imposed by the island piers and it is generally approved of by island residents;there is a strong case for the introduction of a restricted roll-on roll-off service carrying cargo, residents' cars and public service vehicles; andsuch a service would be likely to bring economic and social advantages to the island communities.  However, it would need to be properly managed in order to address the different requirements of each island, protect the environment and preserve the island way of life. The report includes detailed recommendations as to suitable options for establishing such a service.  It also notes that it would not be possible to introduce a ro-ro service to all three islands in the immediate future as procurement of the required infrastructure and vessels would be a lengthy process.The report will assist my Department in planning the further development of the Aran Islands and I look forward to consulting widely with the island communities and other interested parties in this regard.   Any decisions in regard to the implementation of its recommendations will take account of the consultation process, the cost and effectiveness of existing passenger, cargo and air services to the Aran Islands and the level of funding available for the development of the islands in general.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I am aware of the dangers that crack cocaine use can pose in terms of the potential harm it can cause to individuals, families and communities.  I am also aware of the risk that crack cocaine could potentially spread to increasing numbers of cities and towns here.However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, while there has been an increase in the number of seizures of crack cocaine over the past two years or so, this represents a small proportion of the total number of cocaine seizures recorded annually.  Also, it is worth noting that in my visits to various Drugs Task Force areas since my appointment in June, the issue of crack cocaine did not arise to any great extent in my discussions with community representatives and others on the nature of the drug problem in their areas.At the same time, vigilance is undoubtedly necessary and the Gardaí continue to take a number of measures to address the matter.  In this context, I understand that the Garda National Drugs Unit, as well as local drug units, conduct intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of drugs.  Also, targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of potential problem areas is undertaken in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.The most up to date figures on prevalence come from the 2002/2003 All-Island Drug Prevalence Survey.  That survey showed that the use of crack cocaine was very low at that time — 0.3% reported lifetime use; 0.1% reported use in the previous 12 months and there were no positive respondents in relation to last month use.  However, a second Drug Prevalence Study has recently been carried out and the first report on national prevalence figures and trends is expected later this year.  The outcome of this study will give an up-to-date picture of overall problem drug use in Ireland.In addition, I understand that a research study into the nature and extent of crack cocaine use in Dublin is currently being undertaken by the Alcohol and Drug Research Unit (ADRU) of the Health Research Board. The study is being funded by the Department of Justice, Equality & Law Reform and it is hoped that the work will be completed early in 2008.

The report indicates that the experience of the RAPID Programme has been very positive in many areas and the evaluators have concluded that the Programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to those needs.The main strengths of the Programme are stated to be the facilitation of a significant number of local development projects addressing the most pressing needs of the local community.  In the opinion of local stakeholders, these projects would not have progressed without the establishment of the RAPID programme.  Another key strength noted was the establishment of structures that have provided a mechanism for disadvantaged communities to identify needs and to influence policy.  These structures allowed for the development of effective working partnerships between the key players, the levering of greater national and local government investment in RAPID areas and the development of innovative practice with regard to projects, community participation and engagement.The evaluators recommended enhanced monitoring structures, the adoption of annual work programmes, and improved corporate and business planning in agencies to prioritise RAPID areas for investment.  I have considered the evaluation findings and recommendations set out in the Report.  My officials have been working with other Departments and agencies over the last number of months in implementing some of the key recommendations in the report. This work recognises not only the continuing priorities identified by areas in the previous plans but also the need to build on the work and experience gained through completed projects as well as the need to develop new  projects. The aim is to help in bringing a tighter focus to the area plans as each Area Implementation Team (AIT) will prioritise projects within the themes.I initiated the Leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti clean-up, traffic calming, CCTV, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds. Since the introduction of these schemes I have increased the cumulative amount of funds allocated from some €6.5m in 2004 to over €15m to-date.As I have previously indicated I have no plans at present to further extend the areas covered by the RAPID Programme, however, I intend to examine the full updated Census data, and its application to RAPID areas, over the next few months.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	563	The Valuation Act, 2001 which came into effect on 2 May 2002 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable.  In regard to the Valuation Act, 2001, I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act, and that I, as Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) are rateable unless expressly exempted under schedule 4.  Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 outlines the categories of property and the various uses that are deemed to be non rateable under the Act. Paragraphs 10 (education) and 16 (charitable purposes) are two areas in that schedule which may be relevant to the rateability of child care facilities.  Accordingly, purpose-built childcare buildings designed and used to make profit are rateable as commercial buildings. Houses which have been adapted for commercial use in a dedicated area  (i.e. converted garage for exclusive use as childcare ) are rateable, for that specific area.It was not intended that the Valuation Act 2001 would expand or contract the valuation base. The effect of removing any category of property such as commercially operated childcare centres from the valuation base would be to increase the rates burden on other ratepayers.  At the time of drafting the Valuation Act 2001 it was considered that where Exchequer assistance to certain sectors was desirable it should be direct assistance rather than interfering with local authority funding by way of rates relief.The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property. Any ratepayer, dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property, or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children.  Budget 2006 also marked the introduction of a National Childcare Strategy costing a cumulative €2.65bn over five years to address the supply and the cost of childcare.  This strategy included:The introduction of the Early Childcare Supplement worth €1,000 annually for each child up to his/her sixth birthdayA four week extension to both paid and unpaid maternity/adoptive leave in each of 2006 and 2007 bringing the duration of paid leave up to 26 weeks and the duration of unpaid leave to 16 weeksA major new multi-annual National Childcare Investment Programme, running from 2006-2010 to support the creation of an extra 50,000 childcare places.  To complement the roll-out of these new places, a total of 17,000 childcare workers will be trained over the periodA new childminding tax relief was also introduced to support the informal childcare sector.This National Childcare Strategy is also included as part of the Social Inclusion Priorities set out in the recently published National Development Plan.  Furthermore, there is a commitment in ‘Towards 2016' to increase the number of childcare places by 100,000 over the lifetime of the framework through a combination of National Childcare Investment Programme, appropriate successor programme(s) and other providers.I would also mention that in December 2005, the Government established the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) to bring greater coherence to policy making for children.

The legislation provides for the appointment of a mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board which will be responsible for approving and certifying buildings and structures that qualify for relief under the Scheme.  In carrying out this function the Board will be guided by detailed guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The necessary consultations are at an advanced stage and I expect the guidelines to be finalised shortly.The Revenue Commissioners will have responsibility for the granting of tax relief under the scheme in accordance with the specific provisions of Section 29 and with such other provisions of tax law that may apply.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	565	Inheritance tax is part of the capital acquisitions tax (CAT) code, which includes both gift tax and inheritance tax.  It was first introduced in 1976 and replaced estate duty taxation.  The Finance Act 2000 introduced a package of measures specifically designed to reduce the impact of CAT where assets are transferred.  These measures included increased thresholds, the introduction of a single low rate of tax at 20% and the exemption of the family home in certain circumstances.  These measures constituted the most radical reduction in the incidence of gift/inheritance tax since its introduction in 1976.The CAT code includes group thresholds, below which no CAT is liable.  The relationship between the person who provides the gift/inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person receiving the gift/inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the tax-free threshold applicable to the inheritance (the group threshold).  There are three categories of relationship with regard to relief from CAT and these are increased on an annual basis in accordance with the CSO Consumer Price Index.  The indexed group thresholds applying to a gift or inheritance for 2007 are set out in the table.GroupRelationship to DisponerGroup Threshold 2007€ASon/Daughter496,824BParent/Brother/Sister/Niece/ Nephew/Grandchild49,682CRelations other than Group A or B24,841Any other gifts/inheritance that might have been received within the same group by an individual since 5 December 1991 are also taken into account when applying the thresholds for the purposes of calculating CAT.  If the total value of all inheritances and gifts, within the group, which were received since this date is above the relevant threshold, then a 20% CAT will apply on the difference.Favourite niece/nephew relief is available to certain nephews and nieces who take a gift or an inheritance of a business or farm from the disponer. If the niece/nephew qualifies for the relief, they are treated as a child of the disponer for CAT purposes, and instead of a Group B threshold, they are entitled to a Group A threshold for the business or farm assets only.  This means that if a gift or inheritance includes business/farm and non-business/farm assets the Group B threshold will apply to the non-business/farm assets and the Group A threshold will apply to the business/farm assets.In order to qualify for the relief, the applicant must be a child of a brother or sister of the disponer (in other words, a nephew/niece in law will not qualify) and he/she must have worked substantially on a full-time basis for the disponer for a minimum of five years ending on the date of the gift or inheritance.This relief is intended to take account of the close working relationship that exists between certain nieces/nephews and their uncles/aunts and was not intended to apply generally to all gifts or inheritances taken by nieces/nephews.  Applying the relief to all such disposals would lead to a reduction in the tax base.  I have no plans to introduce any changes.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	580	The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose and regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 — 2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement   the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent and/or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  I have also signalled that the more detailed and comprehensive data which will be generated by the new scheme will be monitored by officials in my Office over the coming months and, if appropriate, any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered at that time.

The FSAI has advised that parents of children who display symptoms of hyperactivity or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) should consider limiting their children's consumption of foods containing these additives.  The FSAI also recommends that parents read food labels when buying products so that they can identify if they contain these additives and thus, they can make an informed purchasing decision.  A list of the additives studied in the research is available on the FSAI website.The FSAI has also written to Food and Drink Industry Ireland and to the major retailers in Ireland recommending they continue to build upon ongoing work to remove the additives in question from their products.The European Commission has asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to review the data from the study as a matter of urgency.

If  "partially hydrogenated" oil, or "hydrogenated" oil is mentioned in the list of ingredients, this indicates the use of  unsaturated vegetable oils (or occasionally fish oils) high in polyunsaturated fatty acids which have been subjected to industrial hydrogenation and deodorisation.  This industrial process may lead to the presence of trans fatty acids which are of concern in respect of consumers who are trying to follow a healthy diet which is protective against cardiovascular disease.Trans fatty acids (also referred to as "trans fats") are often used as a substitute for saturated fats: consequently, foods labelled 'low in saturated fats' may  be high in trans fats.  This is a matter of concern, as it may potentially lead to consumers who are trying to follow a healthy diet and protect against cardiovascular disease being misled.Under current EU legislation, the concentration of trans fatty acids does not have to be specified. Consumers may not therefore be aware of the levels of trans fats that they are consuming or the levels contained within foods, for easy comparison.  However, a fundamental review of European labelling legislation is currently underway.  As part of the Irish submission in respect of this review, it was submitted that in order to enable consumers to make informed choices, information on both saturated fat and trans unsaturated fat, in addition to total fat, should be provided.  This is being vigorously pursued in current discussions on this issue.  It is hoped that if manufacturers are required to declare trans fats on nutrition labels, they may be encouraged to reformulate those products which are high in this type of fat.

After 2010 we will continue to increase capacity to ensure that these needs continue to be met.  I am fully confident that this will be achieved through a combination of direct Exchequer provision, PPP and where appropriate in the interim, the use of capacity in the private sector.Developments to date include the procurement of additional capacity (2 linear accelerators) for St. Luke's Hospital Rathgar.  These linear accelerators will be commissioned in February and March 2008 and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned in August and September 2008.  The contract for the design consultants for the interim facilities in Beaumont and St. James's has commenced.

The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) oversees the implementation of the strategy and has taken on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children into the "High Levels of Suicide in Irish Society".In 2006, €1.2m additional funding was allocated for suicide prevention initiatives and research.  A further €1.85 million has been allocated for 2007 bringing the total funding available in 2007 to support suicide prevention initiatives to approximately €8 million.  This funding is being used to develop and implement national training programmes, to complete the availability of self-harm services through A&E Departments, to implement recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services and to support voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.

A patient who has private health insurance is entitled to choose to be treated as a public patient.  To ensure that those who opt to be treated privately are clear on the financial implications of admission as a private patient, they should be asked to sign a form to thiseffect.As you indicate that the patient was designated private without his consent, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Service Executive to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issue directly to the Deputy.In relation to insurance cover for the procedure, at present private health insurers are entitled to apply an initial waiting period of 26 weeks in respect of persons aged under 55, 52 weeks in respect of those aged between 55 and 64, and 104 weeks for persons aged 65 and over before private health insurance cover becomes effective. In addition, insurers are entitled to apply longer waiting periods, up to  10 years, in relation to pre-existing conditions.Enquiries have been made of VHI and having established the history of the condition that necessitated the treatment involved, and confirmation by the individual's G.P. that the condition was present prior to his joining VHI, the claim was rejected.

Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary County Councils have undertaken the development of a proposal for a new Shannon Crossing. Clare County Council is the lead authority for the project.From 2004 to the end of 2006, non-national road grants totalling approximately €371,000 have been provided to the three authorities to develop proposals for the provision of a new Shannon Crossing Bridge. The 2007 grant allocation, provided to Clare County Council under the Strategic Non-National Road stream of grants, is €500,000.A number of consultants were invited by Clare County Council to submit tenders for the design stage of the Shannon Crossing Bridge project and associated road schemes. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 24 September 2007 and the tenders received will now be considered by the Council.Further progression of the Shannon Crossing Bridge project is a matter for consideration by Clare County Council.

One element of that partnership was to be a proposed agreement on civil nuclear cooperation. In March 2006, the two leaders announced that broad agreement on the elements of a deal on the nuclear issue had been reached. In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. In July 2007, negotiations on a formal bilateral agreement were concluded.Further steps remain before civil nuclear cooperation can commence between the US and India, including the negotiation by India of a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a decision in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to exempt India from its export guidelines, and final approval of the US-India bilateral agreement by the US Congress.We have been very closely following developments on the US-India deal, and have had useful contacts with both the US and India on the issue. A number of separate discussions on the proposed agreement have been held at the NSG since March 2006, most recently in mid-September, and Ireland has played a leading role, along with several other like-minded countries, in seeking to clarify the complex issues involved. In the course of all discussions, Ireland has consistently emphasised our deep-rooted commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and our concerns about the potential impact of the US-India deal on the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime.Before formal consideration in the NSG, India must negotiate a safeguards agreement with the IAEA and this must be approved by the IAEA Board of Governors. Our current sense is that the NSG will not be asked to consider any proposal in the matter before the end of this year.

The position is that the Adoption Board does not recognise Libyan adoptions under Irish law, and that these adoptions cannot be entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions recognised by the Board. The children could only have become Irish citizens, in accordance with the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, if it were possible for their adoptions to have been entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions.I indicated in my letter of 18 July 2007 to the Deputy that, in order to facilitate future visits to Ireland by this family, an application could be made for multiple entry visas for the children.As there is no Irish embassy in Libya, any such application should be sent directly to the Visa Office of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), which is located at the Department of Justice, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.

Officials from my Department have met with the family concerned several times and continue to provide them with a wide range of practical assistance. As the Deputy will appreciate, the ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the person concerned is a matter for the Spanish authorities. I understand that the investigating magistrate will shortly decide whether to make public the findings to date.When a death of an Irish citizen occurs abroad, my Department offers all possible assistance and support, including, where necessary, with autopsies, death certificates, lists of lawyers, and liaising with undertakers and airlines. This assistance was provided to the family in this case. As an exceptional additional measure, the Honorary Consul also arranged for the services of a local lawyer to be provided on a pro bono basis for the family during the current phase of the investigation. They have therefore received free legal representation for almost two months. However, my Department is not in a position to pay fees of solicitors or barristers retained by families abroad, and does not intend to introduce legislation in this area.

The marketing of individual areas, including Mullingar, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.I understand from the Agency that there have been four site visits to the IDA Park in Marlinstown, Mullingar, two in 2006 and two to date in 2007.In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the locations of emphasis for IDA Ireland in the midlands counties are the Gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  In addition, the Agency actively promotes the county towns of Portlaoise, Longford and Roscommon.  IDA has been promoting the Marlinstown site of 70 acres to investors seeking substantial acreage. I have been informed that the Agency is now re-submitting a planning application for a new 25,000 sq. ft. Advance Office Building.  This will be followed by a further submission for a 25,000 sq. ft. Advance Technology Building.  These buildings will be promoted by the IDA's overseas and property division to Medical Technology, Financial Services and ICT companies to secure new investments for Mullingar.  All decisions regarding where to visit, as well as where to locate, ultimately are matters for the investing company.

The decision was due to excess capacity in Ireland.  All manufacturing and distribution currently carried out in Drogheda will be transferred to the company's other Irish plants in Athy and Ballina.  Both of these plants have sufficient capacity to meet future demand. The company's shared services operation in Drogheda will remain in place and employ 112 people.  The company expects to create an additional 90 jobs in Co. Kildare and Co. Mayo with employees having an option of transferring from Drogheda.I should point out that the company will continue to employ over 500 people in its business here in Ireland.  I know that, over the years, the company has enjoyed a warm relationship with the people of Drogheda and other businesses in the town and I am confident that it will continue to play an active role in the local community.The company is committed to supporting its employees through a generous redundancy package, retraining, business start up assistance, a high level of outplacement and by promoting the skills and expertise of its employees.  The services of FÁS, the Industrial Training agency, will also be available to those workers who wish to avail of them.The Industrial Development agencies will continue to promote Drogheda and Co.

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.The Dublin / Mid-Leinster Area of the Executive have advised that the person concerned called to the local Community Welfare Office (CWO) of the Executive in early June 2007 and also in September 2007 in order to obtain assistance with regard to clothing and bedding costs.  The person concerned received an exceptional needs payment in both instances from the community welfare officer.Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a recipient of a social welfare or a Health Services Executive payment who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity can apply to their local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement. The Dublin / Mid-Leinster Area of the Executive have advised that no application has been received from the person concerned for a heating supplement. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the local community welfare officer.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  This is achieved primarily by setting out rules as to which State's social security system covers a person when, for example, s/he moves from one Member State to another to take up work or where s/he lives in one State and works another. In addition, the Regulations also set out rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the sickness, unemployment old-age etc.The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which s/he works and the State of employment has, in general, responsibility for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes unemployed or ill. The Regulations also provide that when entitlement to benefit is being examined account must be taken of insurance paid in any other Member State where the person worked.  In the case of pensions, in general, a person will get a pension from each State in which s/he worked in proportion to the periods of insurance completed in each Member State.These rules are set out in Chapter 3 of Title III of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71.  Article 46(2)(a)  provides that each State in which a person has been insured must first calculate the theoretical amount of pension i.e. the pension to which a person would be entitled if s/he had completed all periods of insurance under the legislation of that State. Article 46(2)(b) provides that each State must then calculate the proportioned pension i.e. by multiplying the theoretical amount of that State by the result of the ratio of periods of insurance in that State to the full insurance record of the person concerned.For administrative and customer service reasons these calculations are referred to in the Departmental Guidelines by the formula (A x B)/C, where A is the theoretical amount of pension; B is the number of contributions paid in Ireland; and C is the number of contributions paid in total (i.e. in Ireland and other Member State/s).Regulation 1408/71 is directly applicable in all Member States and therefore transposition measures in national legislation are not required. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide for this formula in Irish legislation.If the Deputy has a particular case she may wish to contact my office for further assistance.

However, people participating in approved courses under the back-to-education allowance scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment and those who qualify for back to education allowance may also qualify for rent supplement, subject to the standard qualifying conditions of the rent supplement scheme.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	613	Credited contributions, or 'credits' as they are termed, are intended to protect the entitlements, particularly the pension rights, of employees and other persons participating in the social insurance system when they are ill or unemployed.  A person who is providing full time care and attention as a carer is awarded credits on the same basis as if they were out of the workforce due to illness or unemployment.Under the current statutory provisions governing the award of credited contributions, recipients of the carer's allowance may be awarded credits if they switched to that payment from another credit-bearing payment such as jobseeker's allowance.  From April 1999, formal provision was made for the award of credits to claimants of carer's allowance who have left insurable employment to engage in caring duties.  People in receipt of carer's benefit or on carer's leave are awarded credits at the same rate as their last paid contribution.Recipients of carer's allowance, who are not entitled to credits, may be eligible for homemaker's disregards which preserve the carer's entitlement for contributory pension purposes.  The homemaker scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for State Pension (contributory) purposes.  The provisions apply from the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1994 and up to 20 contribution years may be disregarded.The award of credits is subject to certain conditions.  For example, when a person has no paid or credited contributions for a period of two years, they cannot be awarded further credits until a further 26 contributions are paid.  In recognition of their caring role, this rule is waived where claimants of carer's allowance were eligible for homemakers disregards immediately prior to claiming carer's allowance.This, in effect, means that credits will be awarded where a person who has a gap of two years in their paid or credited contributions was eligible for homemakers disregards before claiming carer's allowance.  This will protect the position of people who did not give up work to become carers but may have qualified for homemakers disregards due to child-minding duties and who subsequently became carers after a two year period had expired.From June 2006 the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self employment, education or training outside the home and still be eligible for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  Where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution.All aspects of the carer's allowance scheme and supports for carers are kept under review and ways of increasing and expanding services for carers will continue to be examined.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	614	The back to education allowance (BTEA) facilitates people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  The scheme enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.  The payment they receive is equivalent to the standard weekly personal rate of the relevant Social Welfare payment they were in receipt of prior to participation in the scheme.To qualify for participation in the scheme an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  People in receipt of disability related payments may access the scheme at 18 years of age.  Similarly, lone parents and people in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.In addition to providing income support for participants on the back to education programme, the scheme also provides an annual cost of education grant of €400.  This allowance is paid at the start of each academic year.  A person in receipt of free travel or household benefits package prior to award of the back to education allowance will continue to receive these benefits.  Participants may also continue to receive any secondary benefits such as Christmas bonus, fuel allowance, diet supplement, rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement that they may have been in receipt of prior to applying for back to education allowance.Furthermore, from today, a person in receipt of back to education allowance who satisfies the conditions for carer's allowance may also get half the rate of carer's allowance together with their existing payment.

However, people participating in approved courses under the back-to-education allowance scheme may apply for rent supplement in respect of private rented accommodation if they have not been previously getting a supplement. A person who has been receiving rent supplement before taking up full-time education with the assistance of the Back To Education may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, which had been in payment prior to the commencement of their education course.The benefit to those participating in the back-to-education allowance scheme is that their status as a full time student does not preclude them from receiving rent or mortgage interest supplements. I consider this to be a positive financial incentive to take up educational opportunities and I would regard the existing arrangements applying as satisfactory. I would encourage people availing of the back to-education allowance to contact their local community welfare officer to clarify their entitlement to rent supplement in their circumstances.I would also encourage people who have been receiving rent supplement on a long-term basis to contact their Local Community Welfare Officer to discuss the options available to assist them in progressing from welfare dependence. Options include the Back To Education and Back To Work allowance programs.

Cash income may be derived from a wide variety of sources including earnings from employment, income from self-employment including farming, income from foreign social security pensions and income from occupational pensions including pensions payable as a result of illness or disability. Income derived from social welfare pensions payable by my Department is not assessed, except in the case of Family Income Supplement.In the case of One Parent Family Payment and analogous schemes such as Jobseeker's Allowance and Disability Allowance, specific disregards from earnings and tapered assessment rates have been introduced over the years. In the case of One-Parent Family Payment, the first €146.50 of earnings (and income from self-employment) is disregarded and half of any earnings in excess of this amount are assessed as means. The purpose of these arrangements is to encourage persons to enter or re-enter the workforce. Disregards do not normally apply where a person has cash income from other sources, including non-social welfare pensions.Family Income Supplement (FIS) is a social welfare payment for low income families with children where one (or both of a couple) is in employment for 19 hours or more per week. All cash income is assessed including income from social welfare payments. A supplement is payable at 60% of the difference between the appropriate weekly income threshold for that family and the families net cash income after income tax and PRSI payments.Any change to the current means testing arrangements in relation to income from private or occupational pensions, including illness related pensions, would have to be considered in a Budgetary context, having regard to available resources.

Local authorities are responsible for determining rents payable under the differential rents scheme including the income to be assessed for this purpose, subject to broad principles laid down by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I understand that these guidelines recommend that no more than 15% of any increase in welfare income should be absorbed by an increase in rent. Around Budget time, my predecessors have, in recent years, written to the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government requesting him to remind local authorities of this. It is my intention to make a similar request this year.The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive monitor the number of medical cards and GP visit cards on an ongoing basis and the need for changes to the guidelines is kept under review, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	620	Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Rent supplement is not normally paid where the rent is in excess of the limits. Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example:where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons,where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short periodwhere the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.My Department has received no specific evidence of rent supplement recipients having to supplement their rent above the amount stated for the purpose of receiving rent supplements.In January 2007 a review of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive a rent supplement was completed. The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits, applicable from January 2007 until 30th June 2008. I am satisfied that the new limits reflected realistic market conditions throughout the country. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.The limits will be reviewed next year. Any revision found to be necessary will be implemented with effect from 1st July 2008.

It is envisaged that the preparation of the Strategy will involve extensive consultation with the public and will take up to two years to complete.The Deputy will also be aware that some time ago I commissioned a linguistic study on the usage of Irish in Gaeltacht areas.  The position with respect to this study is set out in my reply to Question No. 45 on today's Order Paper.A further priority will be to continue to support An Foras Teanga/The North South Language Body in its work in fostering and developing the Irish language and Ulster Scots throughout the island of Ireland.  My Department will also continue to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and with the EU Institutions in meeting the challenges arising from the official and working language status accorded to Irish since 1 January of this year.Finally, we will continue to progress the implementation, on a phased basis, of the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003 with the objective of ensuring that improvements in the range and quality of public services available through Irish will be achieved over time, subject to demand.

My Department is, consequently, closely involved with Bord Bia in the promotion of the live weanling trade.  Activities undertaken include:Showcase events for Irish weanlings involving exporters, importers, feedlot owners and media;Promotional support to the trade including trade advertising and distribution of information and literature to potential customers in the markets;Inward buyer visits to Ireland; andVaried support to exporters including market and customer research, credit checks, translations, facilitating meetings, market information and study visits.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	624	My Department has been particularly proactive in providing information and advice to the farming community and the veterinary profession in relation to Bluetongue.Earlier in the summer my Department sent an information leaflet to every farmer and veterinary practitioner in the country providing information on the disease, including the clinical signs with which farmers and veterinarians should familiarise themselves.  My Department organised an industry seminar in July which was attended, amongst others, by representatives of the farm bodies. My Department has also placed notices on Bluetongue in the farming papers including in this week's Irish Farmers Journal.In addition, my Department has a dedicated Bluetongue website which contains a comprehensive range of useful information and advice and this website will continue to be updated and will be a very useful source for farmers, veterinarians and any other handlers of livestock.  The website can be accessed at www.bluetongue.ie.I am very conscious of the need to ensure that the Irish farming community is sufficiently informed, not least following confirmation that the presence of the disease has been confirmed in England, and my Department and I will ensure that our communications strategy is kept under review and revised as appropriate.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	625	All consignments of beef coming from third countries must first be landed at a EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) and there undergo documentary, identity and physical checks that are prescribed under harmonised EU rules. In Ireland BIPs approved for the processing direct imports into this country of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the European Communities carries out monitoring and inspection of each Member State's BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied. Under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998 contract with my Department, application of import controls on animal products destined for human consumption are also monitored by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. I am satisfied that these import controls are correctly applied in Ireland.Animal products that have met all the required conditions are released for free circulation within the Community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.I brought the IFA's report on Brazilian Beef production to the attention of Commissioner Markos Kyprianou Commissioner for Health some time ago and received a detailed response and assessment from the Commission.  While I fully accept the Commission's reassurance that all appropriate measures would be taken to protect EU consumers, I have noted that certain deficiencies highlighted by the IFA were recognised by the EU Food and Veterinary Office. I have been informed that further FVO missions are being undertaken to Brazil and that the Commission would reassess the authorisation of exports from Brazil in the light of the outcome of these missions.  I have impressed on the Commissioner the need to ensure that the deficiencies noted are properly and promptly addressed.In relation to these imports I have been consistent in my view that Irish farmers deserve fair play in the market place.  At EU level I have clearly advocated that produce imported from non-EU countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers.  In the interests of both EU producers and consumers I will continue to adopt this approach.  The debate in recent months has been important in highlighting the need for the highest possible public and animal health standards.  This has always been a priority for me.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I am aware of the current difficulties for pig producers arising from the escalation of feed prices in recent months.  While I appreciate the need for increased pigmeat prices to compensate for higher input costs, I do not have a role in price setting. I am glad to see, however, that Irish producer prices increased by around 7% in the last few weeks while prices throughout the EU are in line with the average for the past 5 years. I have asked Bord Bia to intensify its Autumn pork and bacon promotion campaign.As regards the reference to imported pigmeat being sold under Irish brand names, I am working with the Department of Health and Children on draft legislation that will require the country of origin to be shown on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. A public consultation is currently being conducted on the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. This legislation will require the approval of the European Commission.A number of factors have contributed to the dramatic rise in feed prices over the last 6 months. These factors include (i) heavy demand for cereals in Asia (ii) the increased demand for feed materials from the biofuel industry and (iii) unfavourable weather conditions which affected many of the major cereal growing countries.The decision at the September Agriculture Council of Ministers, to set at zero the set-aside rate for 2008 will have significant impact on the availability of cereals in the EU next year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	629	With regard to the Single Payment Scheme, I approached Commissioner Fischer Boel earlier this year, seeking her agreement to have payments made with effect from 16 October, rather than 1 December as is provided for in the relevant EU regulations. While the Commissioner indicated that she could not agree to this request at the time, she did make it clear in her written response that she agreed with the need to work for greater simplification, proposing that the matter be further pursued in the broader context of the CAP Health Check, scheduled to commence later this year. The commitment by the Commissioner to pursue this matter is important to Ireland, as I will be seeking, as part of the Health Check negotiations, a change in the Regulations to provide for a Single Payment Scheme payment commencement date of 16 October.I subsequently approached the Commissioner a second time, outlining the adverse weather conditions that pertained during June, July and August, which seriously affected farming. I was particularly conscious of the difficulties caused for farmers, with significant delays in production of winter fodder, fodder intended for use next winter being fed to animals and some animals being housed early, as land was too wet to graze. I am pleased to say that, in response to this approach, a proposal to provide for advance payments, at a rate of 50%, was unanimously approved by the Direct Payments Management Committee at it's meeting last week.Work in my Department is at an advanced stage to maximise the number of payments that will be made on 16 October and thereafter and, in this regard, I would urge any applicants who have received correspondence from the SPS Unit of my Department in relation to specific problems on their SPS applications, to reply to these letters immediately. Until such time as a given query is resolved, no payment can be made. I might add that the level of errors on this year's applications is much higher than might have been expected, with many applicants making minor errors. Each of these requires to be resolved in order to allow payment to issue.With regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, payments commenced last week and, to date, payments worth in excess of €223 million have issued to over 91,000 farmers. Payments are continuing to issue as cases become clear and, again, I would urge anybody who has received correspondence from my Department highlighting problems in relation to DAS, to respond without delay as, by doing so, those cases can then be processed to finality and payments issued.Mindful of the significant numbers of applications under both the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme which have been shown to contain errors, I have again arranged to have a series of Lo-call telephone numbers set up, to assist farmers who wish to contact the SPS Unit of my Department, in order to resolve outstanding queries. These numbers are as follows:1890 252 235: Clare, Cavan, and Limerick;1890 252 236: Cork, Westmeath;1890 252 242: Kildare, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Waterford and Wicklow;1890 252 243: Carlow, Kilkenny, Louth, Monaghan, and Sligo;1890 252 244: Donegal, Dublin, Offaly and Wexford;1890 200 502: Galway, Kerry, Mayo, Meath and Roscommon;1890 250 598: Tipperary.It is likely, however, in view of the high level of queries identified under both schemes, that large numbers of farmers will seek to telephone the SPS Unit, particularly in the days immediately following the initial issuing of payments. Again, I would stress that these farmers should, in the first instance, ensure that they have adequately replied to any correspondence, which they have received from the Unit in relation to problems with their applications.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The proposals for an Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds were originally submitted to the European Commission in December 2006 as part of the Draft Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP).  Following consultations with the Commission services on the details of this scheme, certain modifications were made and a revised application for state aid approval was submitted to them on 15 August 2007.  This is currently under consideration by the Commission.  My Department is in regular contact with the Commission with a view to obtaining approval as rapidly as possible.A budget of €250 million has been allocated to the scheme with annual payments of €80 per cow, payable over five years, envisaged for suckler cow farmers who undertake to comply with the welfare measures set out.  A payment ceiling of a 100 suckler cows in any herd will apply.As regards sheep I must emphasise that sheep farmers are already major beneficiaries under REPS.  However under the REPS 4 a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced.  The purpose of this measure is to support the mixed grazing of sheep and cattle that would yield both environmental and sector development benefits.  The practice of mixed grazing is beneficial both to the protection of biodiversity and to traditional landscapes.  They also contribute to animal welfare by facilitating mixed/rotational grazing, thus reducing stomach parasite load.  A budget of €28m a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over €170m for the period to 2013.

The first element is the compensation for the reduction in the minimum price of beet, which has been incorporated into the Single Payment Scheme since last year. It is worth approximately €123 million to Irish beet growers over seven years.The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry.  Payments of restructuring aid worth approximately  €15 million were made to former beet growers and machinery contractors earlier this year.  Amended EU proposals on restructuring will result in an increased allocation to growers.  The level and timing of this additional payment must await an EU Commission Regulation setting out detailed rules for payment.The third element is the diversification aid, worth almost €44m in Ireland's case.  Payments worth almost €22 million have begun to issue to the farmers concerned. A further payment of diversification aid, worth an additional €22 million will be made subject to clearance with the EU Commission.  Discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the taxation of the Diversification aid.  Taxation issues are however ultimately a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.

This is because of the worldwide ban on live animals and beef products from Ireland and other EU member states following the BSE crisis in the EU in late 2000.There had been a good trade in live animals to the Lebanon in recent years but it has declined due to commercial reasons.With the abolition of all export refunds for live exports it is unlikely that markets can be secured outside the EU because of the lower market returns there.

The issue has been examined from time to time.One hundred posts (100) in my Department will relocate from Dublin to Athlone next year, so my Department will relocate 400 posts from Dublin into new permanent accommodation in Athlone and Mullingar over a period of approximately 2 years. The capacity of my Department to manage its business if this process is accelerated will be a major consideration deciding as to whether it is appropriate to relocate a number of posts into temporary accommodation in Mullingar in advance of the full move of 300 posts into the new permanent accommodation.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	645	Grammar is the study of forms of speech and their relation to one another and is concerned with the application of the rules of a language in speech and in writing. The Irish language is a living language, which in common with other languages, evolves and changes through usage. The grammar of a language reflects the consensus of academics, lexicographers and linguists on the standard usage at any given period in time.  As it is language usage that determines grammar, it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Education and Science to propose changes to, or simplification of, the grammar of the Irish language, and I have no proposals in this regard.I fully agree with the approach recommended in the primary curriculum that pupils should be taught Irish in a lively communicative way, where they hear Irish spoken regularly and have frequent opportunities to practice using the Irish language in a variety of contexts. This authentic approach to language acquisition is in keeping with international best practice for teaching and learning additional languages. This can be augmented by introduction to more formal grammar as learners develop fluency in communicating through Irish.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I presume that the Deputy is referring to the staffing in Gaeltacht schools.  The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.  I am aware of the unique position of primary schools situated in Gaeltacht areas and of the particular problems that they experience as a result of losing teaching posts.  Under current arrangements the enrolment figure required for the appointment of a mainstream class teacher in a Gaeltacht school is the same as that which applies in the case of an ordinary primary school.  However the figure required for the retention of a mainstream class teacher in a Gaeltacht school is lower in the case of posts from the 3rd to the 10th mainstream teacher, relative to ordinary primary schools.  This retention policy has applied to Gaeltacht schools since the 1999/2000 school year.  Gaeltacht schools operate under the same criteria that applies to ordinary schools for all other staffing within a primary school.  Allowances are paid to teachers in primary schools in the Gaeltacht in respect of teaching through the medium of Irish.

However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by the Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.  At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee, Naas.  In addition, a brand new 16 classroom school has been provided for Naas together with the provision of temporary accommodation at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth's & St. Mary's NS, St. Conleth's Naofa and Mercy Convent in Naas.  A major building project is at Stage 3 of architectural planning to provide Caragh NS, Naas, with an additional 12-classrooms and ancillary accommodation. Gaelscoil Nás na Riogh has recently been approved to commence architectural planning for the provision of a new 16-classroom school.  On top of this, approval has been given for the provision of a new 32-classroom school for Kill.  Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David's National School and Two Mile House National School.  The accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Convent of Mercy and Scoil Corbán in Naas and Scoil Pádraig in Johnstown are also currently being assessed.  At Sallins National School, a seven classrooms extension is completed and this extension has increased capacity from 9 classrooms to 16 classrooms.  An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms has commenced architectural planning.At post primary level, the management authority of St. Patrick's Post Primary School, Co. Kildare V.E.C., is currently progressing plans to re-locate the school and extend capacity to 1000 pupil places.  Additionally, an extension project is completed at St. Mary's College, Naas which increases capacity at the school to 900 pupils.  A similar extension was recently completed at Meanscoil Iognaid Rís, Naas and a further extension at the school is currently in architectural planning.  All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the area concerned.  The School Planning Section of the Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.

Each special class attracts a staffing of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 SNAs per group comprising a maximum of six pupils.  Additional SNAs are allocated on a case by case basis if deemed appropriate.The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism and I am pleased to advise her that discussions have commenced in this regard.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early intervention for pre-school children with autism.Children diagnosed with autism are eligible for 10 hours home tuition per week from age 2.5 and the allocation increases to 20 hours per week when they reach 3 years of age.  The associated cost reflects the appropriate part time teacher's rate of payment and the actual hours undertaken. My Department sanctioned home tuition for approximately four hundred children of a pre-school age during the 2006/2007 school year.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, cognisant of the difficulties being experienced by parents in securing home tutors the Programme for Government commits to providing a central database of suitably trained personnel seeking employment as home tutors.

Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalty for such an offence, on summary conviction, is a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.It is Irish Prison Service policy to report seizures of mobile phones to the Garda authorities.  It is important to note that prosecutions will not arise in respect of all instances of mobile phone seizure, owing to the number of mobile phones found in double cells, toilet areas or in the prison yards.  It would be impossible to determine in such instances what prisoner was the owner or intended recipient of such devices.I can assure the Deputy that I am determined to deal with the problem of prisoners using mobile phones and, in this context, I believe technology offers the only real answer to dealing with the problem.  In that regard the Prison Service is at an advanced stage in the examination and procurement of technological options for dealing with the use of mobile phones within prisons.  In the time available, it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of prosecutions for possession of mobile phones.  I will furnish the information to the Deputy as soon as possible.

As the nature of the Reserve is that participation is purely voluntary, Garda Reserve members have work, family and other commitments which they have to balance with their service in An Garda Síochána.An Garda Síochána and the PAS is offering maximum flexibility in order to accommodate those who wish to put themselves forward for service.  Recruitment is ongoing and new applications are accepted at any time.  It is open to those who have initially shown interest in becoming Garda Reserve members to renew that interest now, or at any stage in the future, and An Garda Síochána and the PAS will continue to facilitate those who are interested.  I have been informed that the PAS intend contacting people from Kildare again in the near future in order to arrange interviews for them in the coming months.There are currently 5 people from County Kildare in training to become Garda Reserve members.  It is expected that they will be fully qualified and operational in the Carlow/Kildare Division by November 2007.

The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day,  the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc. It is the responsibility of the Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division taking everything into account.The situation will be kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Carlow/Kildare Division will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in May 2007.  I understand that applications received in early July 2006 are currently being dealt with.

The position regarding the first named person is unchanged.The second named person arrived in the State on 20 May, 2005 and applied for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 26 April, 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned  was informed by letter dated 3 November, 2004 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.Her case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain temporarily in the Sate.  On 21 January, 2005 my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this Order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on 24 February, 2005, in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State.  She failed to present herself as required and was classified as evading her deportation. She should therefore present herself to the GNIB without any further delay.By correspondence dated 15 May 2007 the legal representative of the person concerned wrote to my Department providing new information and advising that his client should be permitted to make a new asylum claim on behalf of herself and her two children.  My Department is currently awaiting the lodgement of supporting documentation in respect of this claim.In addition, my Department does not appear to be in receipt of any documentation requesting the exercise of my discretion under Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	684	The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007, which was initiated in the Seanad on 25 April 2007, sets out a legislative framework for the management of inward migration to Ireland and represents a comprehensive overhaul of the State's laws on immigration, and on the protection of refugees and others, dating back to the Aliens Act 1935. It lays down a number of important principles governing the presence in the State of foreign nationals, including the obligation on a foreign national who is unlawfully in the State to leave. It also sets out statutory processes for applying for a visa, for entry to the State, for residence in the State, for protection in the State and for being required, when necessary, to leave.The Government, as part of its agreed Programme for Government, committed itself to reviewing the Bill. In the context of that review, a significant number of amendments, many of which are technical in nature, have been identified as being required to the published Bill. In addition, other matters under development at the time of publication, and intended to be brought forward by way of Committee Stage amendment, are now ready for inclusion in the text.Accordingly, rather than seeking to have the published Bill restored to the Order Paper of the recently-elected Seanad, it is my intention to bring a proposal to Government seeking approval for the publication of a new Bill, incorporating the substance of the published Bill, as early as possible in this Session.  The Bill as published in that form will facilitate debate on the details.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	685	There are two main categories of visa — a single journey and a multiple journey.  Within those categories, there are two types — one allows a stay of up to 90 days and the other a longer period.Irish visas are sought for a wide variety of purposes, e.g. holiday, visit, business, conference, employment, exam, interview, join family, medical reasons, sports tournaments, study, training, etc.  All applicants are advised to make an application at least eight weeks before their proposed travel date.  At present it takes, an average, four to six weeks to process an application.The number of staff dealing with specific visa categories can vary dependent on the volume of applications at hand.  However, there is a core group of sixteen visa officers in my Department based in Dublin; there are also staff based in Embassies and Consulates abroad who come under the control of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has been given delegated sanction to approve visas in certain circumstances and, in fact, the vast majority of visa applications are approved under this delegated sanction without reference to my Department.  Applications not within the delegated sanction are referred to my Department for processing. At present there are no plans to review the visa processing/application processes.

As part of the implementation of this policy, my Department has allocated funding of over €8 million to County and City Councils for the development of 167 new or refurbished playgrounds since 2004.  The location of the playgrounds which benefit from these moneys is a matter for the local authority to decide.  Grant aid of approximately €4.1m in respect of over 80 playgrounds remains to be drawn down from my Department by local authorities.  An assessment of the overall scheme will be made by my Department when full information is available upon completion of all the projects in those local authorities currently approved for grant aid.  The question of inviting further proposals from local authorities will be kept under review in the light of progress made and the availability of funds to my Department for these purposes.

Accordingly, no distinction between guesthouses and Bed and Breakfast establishments should be made by local authorities in applying water charges.  Where there is a mixture of domestic and non-domestic use in a premises, an annual allowance, based on the local authority's reasonable estimation of the domestic element of water consumption in the premises, is applied to reduce the overall charge to the consumer.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	697	The Turoe Stone in Galway is a national monument in the ownership of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  While the Stone itself is in State ownership, it is located on privately owned lands, currently in use as a pet farm.  The monument was moved before in the 19th century, having originally been located several miles away at the Rath of Feerwore.Concerns have been increasing about the deterioration in the condition of the monument.  Reports from a specialist company, commissioned in 1995 and again in 2005, by the Office of Public Works, which manages the monument on behalf of my Department, found it to be suffering from adverse weathering, water damage and human contact with considerable loss of carved detail on the stone's surface.In the course of subsequent discussions between my Department and OPW on the future conservation of the Stone it was agreed, as an initial temporary measure, to build a small shed-like structure around it to protect it from further weathering.  This work was carried out in 2005 and the temporary shed remains in place.  A notice was placed in the local papers stating that the Stone was being closed to the public until further notice.Further environmental monitoring of the Stone's condition since it was put under cover has confirmed that : covering the stone has killed off organic growths or rendered them dormant ; areas of surface friability are still present, with a high risk that loose grains will continue to be lost; reduction in lichen cover has revealed previously unnoticed damage; and, the temporary shelter for the stone has not eliminated the risk of freeze/thaw damage.  It was concluded in the circumstances that the necessary cleaning and stabilising of the surfaces of the Stone should be undertaken as a priority and that moving the Stone to an environmentally controlled indoor location would be in the best interests of ensuring that it does not suffer more, irreversible damage.My Department subsequently requested the views of the Director of the National Museum on the long-term protection of the Stone.  In response, the Director indicated his agreement that the only way to ensure it remains in good condition and retains its unique decorative features would be to move it to a controlled indoor environment.  In the light of the advice I have received I am in agreement that, to secure its protection in the longer term, the Stone should be moved to an environmentally-controlled indoor location, where it will not be further exposed to the effects of weathering.The National Museum has indicated that it is satisfied, following discussions and an inspection, that the new Galway City Museum is a suitable location for the Turoe Stone.  A high quality replica has been completed and will be put in place at the same time as the original stone is moved.  Given the international importance of the Stone there is clearly an onus on the State to secure its integrity in the longer-term.  Its replacement by a high quality replica on site will at the same time serve to give visitors an appropriate impression of what the Stone is like in its current setting.  The proposed approach, which is fully in accordance with archaeological best practice, was communicated to local public representatives and to the land-owner.  To date my Department has received one letter from a local member of the public objecting to the proposal.Arising from deterioration in their condition and threats of further damage a number of other monuments have been moved to indoor locations either in their vicinity or to a museum.  High Crosses at Clonmacnoise, a stone carved in the La Tene style formerly located at Killycluggan, Co. Cavan and Crosses at Durrow, Co. Offaly have all been protected in this manner.  The question of whether any other monuments under threat of damage require protection from the elements in a similar way, will be considered, as appropriate on a case by case basis.  There is increasing evidence at European level that the effects of climate change can have serious implications for archaeological monuments.

Each licence application is dealt with individually and any conservation impact on the particular species is taken into account in line with the provisions of the Act.  The hunting control measures currently in place are sufficient to ensure the conservation of protected species; however I will implement any additional measures as and when required.My Department recently issued a licence to the Irish Coursing Club allowing most of its affiliated clubs to net hares for the purpose of hare coursing. One Club (Westmeath United Coursing Club) has been excluded from the netting licence for the 2007/2008 season following a successful prosecution for the illegal netting of hares in 2006.  It was also decided to curtail the number of courses allowed by Cappoquin and Dungarvan coursing clubs.  There is no current evidence that coursing has a significant effect on hare populations and my decision to issue this licence took into consideration the final report of the Status of Hares in Ireland — Hare Survey of Ireland 2006/07.My Department is currently in discussions with representatives of the Ward Union Stag Hunt concerning their application for a hunting licence for the coming season.  I have raised a number of issues of serious concern with the Ward Union Hunt including in relation to conservation and protection of stags generally and compliance with previous licence conditions.  When the discussions with my Department are concluded I will be making my decision on the licence application.

The EPA must, at a minimum, ensure compliance with the stringent standards set by the EU Incineration Directive, standards which represent best international practice in providing for the protection of human health and the environment.  While incineration is not a cornerstone of current waste management policy, this rigorous licensing process ensures that the best available technology and safeguards are used in respect of those incinerator proposals that may be licensed by the EPA.

Backed by an unprecedented €18 billion investment in housing programmes provided for under the National Development Plan, 2007-2013, my Department's social housing investment programme is focused on meeting the needs of individual residents by providing them with homes for life in safe and well-planned neighbourhoods.State support for the accommodation needs of older people or people with special housing needs, ranges from grant schemes which allow people to remain in their homes to the provision of specific sheltered housing options. For many older people, grants to adapt or improve their homes or address mobility problems can prolong independent living for as long as possible. New grant schemes to replace grant support for adapting homes of people with a disability and of older people, will be rolled out later this year. The new schemes will be more streamlined with greater targeting to those most in need.Assessment of need is critical in determining housing supports, including supports for older people, and my Department is implementing a new means of assessment to provide an improved basis for policy development and service delivery. Local authorities have in place multi-annual Housing Action Plans which encompass delivery of social and affordable housing in their areas. These plans provide the framework for the delivery of a coherent and holistic response to local housing need, including specific housing needs of older people. This includes provision by the Voluntary and Co-operative Housing sector.Capital allocations to individual local authorities are determined on the basis of the Housing Action Plans submitted. Exchequer capital spending in 2007 on social housing new build and renewal programmes will amount to over €1.2 billion and some €66m will be spent on grants to adapt private housing. The Department does not have data on the proportion of this spending which will specifically benefit older people.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	703	Primary responsibility for the monitoring, management, protection and improvement of water quality is currently assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation.  The EPA, through its Office of Environmental Enforcement, exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities.In addition, since 1997, my Department has been promoting a comprehensive, catchment-based, national strategy to combat eutrophication in rivers and lakes. As part of the process of implementing the EU Water Framework Directive, this catchment-based strategy was expanded to include all waters — including groundwaters, estuaries and coastal waters.The Water Framework Directive requires a co-ordinated approach to water management in respect of whole river basins.  A total of eight River Basin Districts (RBDs) have been identified on the whole island of Ireland to form the "administrative areas" for co-ordinated management.Under the European Communities (Water Policy) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 722 of 2003), the competent authorities for the purposes of the establishment of environmental objectives and programmes of measures and the making of river basin management plans, are the relevant local authorities in each RBD.  In addition, the Regulations specify that, in each of the RBDs, one of the local authorities will act as a coordinator for all of the others.  These Regulations also require the EPA to take such measures as it considers appropriate to promote and facilitate the co-ordination of activities for the purposes of implementating of the Water Framework Directive.  I have no proposals to establish a separate, stand-alone authority with responsibility for water quality.

Accordingly, I do not propose to review metering policy and I welcome the fact that the metering programme should be substantially completed by local authorities by the end of this year.The Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, which I launched on 17 September 2007, incorporates a national water conservation sub-programme under which €288 million is available to local authorities to fund:(a) management systems to monitor water use and loss in the public supply networks;(b) targeted leakage control measures, whereby local authorities locate and repair leaking pipes; and(c) the rehabilitation and replacement of obsolete supply networks, where repair has proven to be uneconomic due to the age/condition of the pipes.These measures will enable local authorities to reduce unaccounted for water levels in public distribution networks, to improve the quality of supply to consumers, to lower operating costs and to maximize the value of investments in new works.   Details of the allocations to individual authorities under the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, including the allocations for water conservation works, are available in the Oireachtas Library.

Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authorities, which have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the Planning Acts, including the new power to refuse planning permission, without recourse to the High Court, to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.The 2000 Planning Act also contains other relevant provisions in relation to the completion of housing estates, including provision for planning conditions requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a development and conditions for the phasing of developments i.e. requiring that one phase of a development would have to be completed in its entirety before the next phase could be commenced.Also, Section 180 of the Planning Act provides that where estates have not been completed properly and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the residents of the estate, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.  The decision whether to take the estate in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.Wider issues relating to the reform of land and conveyancing law are matters for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

My Department is currently examining Longford County Council's Design Review Report for the scheme.  The Council will be in a position to prepare Contract Documents once the Design Review has been approved.The Legan and Kenagh Sewerage Scheme was fourth on the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Longford County Council in response to my Department's request to all local authorities in 2006 to undertake assessments of needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of these assessments.  The priority lists were taken into account in framing the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.  Given the level of competing demand for the available funding, and the priorities identified for Longford, I regret that it has not been possible to include the scheme in the current Programme.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	708	There are no plans to create a scheme of grant assistance for remediation of homes with radon levels that exceed the National Reference Level adopted by the Government in respect of houses. No such scheme has been introduced in Ireland previously.Increasing the awareness of the public to the risks posed by radon in the home is considered to be a more effective approach than the provision of State financial assistance schemes to householders for radon testing of their homes or for radon remediation works. Such schemes of assistance are not operated by the majority of EU Member States.It would be difficult for a demand led scheme of domestic radon grants to ensure appropriate and cost effective targeting of remedial action. Furthermore, such a scheme could require significant public expenditure and administrative resources.The testing of houses for radon is a relatively straightforward, non-invasive and inexpensive (approximately €50) process.The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has, for many years now, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country, and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations.Householders, particularly those in high radon areas, as identified by the RPII in a nationwide survey (see RPII website www.rpii.ie), have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary. This will continue to be the focus so as to enable and encourage householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.In addition, the Building Regulations introduced by the Department in 1998 and up-dated in 2004 also require all new buildings, including new houses, to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction.Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by this Department called Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options and which is available on the department's website at www.environ.ie. The RPII has also issued guidance entitled Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide.  This is available on the RPII website, as is a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and can offer specific advice and recommendations.
