#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following important matter, namely the possible disruption of electricity supplies this weekend due to the threatened industrial action by some workers at ESB from Friday and the efforts the Government will make to ensure the security of electricity supply and the resolution of current problems during this period.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a matter of national importance namely that 30 kg of plutonium which is enough to make eight nuclear bombs has gone missing at Sellafield and that there have been security breaches on 45 occasions last year at British nuclear installations including a case of unauthorised access and the theft of sensitive information.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a matter of urgent national importance namely the illegal deduction by health boards from State benefits of people with intellectual disability who reside in public institutions and that under no circumstances should the statute of limitations be applied to the calculation of refunds.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to address a matter of urgent public concern, namely, the report of 30 kg. of separated plutonium going missing at Sellafield and the need to know when the Irish Government became aware of this information in the light of the court case taken by Government which led to a decision for the UK authorities to keep the Irish Government informed of any such nuclear related matters.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It is proposed to take No. 17a, motion regarding membership of committee; No. 5, Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005 — Second Stage (resumed); and No. 4, Criminal Justice Bill 2004 — Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) No. 17a. shall be decided without debate; and (2) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 5 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	8	There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 17a. motion re membership of committee, without debate, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 5, conclusion of Second Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005, agreed?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is not agreed. The imposition of the guillotine on the social welfare Bill proposed for 1.30 p.m. today is another example of the curtailment of real and full debate which the Government has employed on a raft of legislation. Yesterday we saw the example of rushed legislation and the unaccommodating approach of Government to full participation by all Members. In the debate being allowed for, only two of my colleagues will have the opportunity to participate. If that is a pro rata indication of the number of speakers allowed across the floor of the House, the significant majority of Members of this House will not have a chance to participate on Second Stage of the social welfare Bill.This is a major matter and this proposal should not be accepted. The social welfare Bill is an important Bill and I suggest that the Tánaiste lift the guillotine and allow full participation for all Members who wish to offer. I know there are other Deputies who would like to participate but who cannot do so on the basis of this guillotine proposal. I strongly oppose it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Green Party also opposes the guillotining of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005 for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin in that a number of my party members will not have an opportunity to speak on it. More importantly perhaps from a national point of view, the decision by Government to invest pension funds increasingly in the oil industry begs questions as to what the Government sees as being the future of all our pensions.Likewise, the social welfare Bill is important when one considers the EU Commission report stating that Irish women are more at risk of poverty than women of any other member state. This shows the need for full reform. I have spoken briefly to the Minister about this matter but the whole prospect of a guaranteed basic income, or reversing the growing gap between rich and poor, needs to be part of the debate. That debate will be curtailed if the Government has its way.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I must put the question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I wish to raise three matters on the Order of Business. No. 50 deals with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty Bill and Ireland's obligations thereunder. Further to the matter that Deputy O'Dowd raised, without being in any way hysterical, have the British Government and authorities been contacted about a report that 30 kg of plutonium has been deemed missing in the internal audit of the British Ministry of Defence and UK Atomic Energy Authority? That matter should be clarified forthwith in view of the legitimate concerns of a great many people and the global climate in which we live.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Deputy, that is not in order.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Second, regarding yesterday's Supreme Court judgment, perhaps I might ask the Tánaiste if she now accepts collective responsibility for the part of the judgment stating that, as was accepted by the Attorney General from the date on which that section came into effect on 1 July 2001, there was no possible room for doubt, as health boards were not entitled——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Deputy, that matter was discussed in the House for two hours yesterday.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Yes, I know that, but was it discussed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was then the Attorney General who would have advised that Government? The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was deemed to have left a meeting when the matter was discussed.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising that matter, which is not appropriate to the Order of Business this morning.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	18	His two Ministers of State were present, and it seems that the former Minister for Health and Children was in full possession of that information——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Deputy has made his point. It does not arise on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	20	——and sought not to act on it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I call the Tánaiste on the nuclear test ban issue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Third, arising from the moving of the writs and their acceptance regarding Meath and north Kildare, if we are to be faced with three and a half weeks of promises made by Ministers, we should inject an element of common sense into what is to happen. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, who is not here this morning, announced that he was closing in on a rail deal for Meath——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	23	That does not arise on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	24	——when, as the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, will know, two years ago——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising that. There is a number of ways in which that can be done within Standing Orders.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I will finish in ten seconds. Two years ago the Government produced a comprehensive rail package for the country, and County Meath was not mentioned.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I call the Tánaiste on the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	28	That proposal is being put forward by Meath County Council.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I suggest that the Deputy submit a question to the relevant Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	30	If we are to have such announcements from Ministers, let them be based on fact rather than fantasy.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	31	That does not arise on the Order of Business. There is a number of opportunities available to the Deputy to raise that matter. I call the Tánaiste.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Perhaps the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is having some of the rub-off that his Minister for State, Deputy Callely, had the other day when he announced it.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Regarding the legislation the Deputy raised, the draft heads of the Bill are currently being prepared by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. I do not know if he has been in touch with colleagues, but I will raise the matter with him.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	34	You are very lucky. I bet you do not regret it now. You are better off with us.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I call Deputy Rabbitte, without interruption.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Regarding the same Supreme Court judgment, perhaps the Tánaiste will assure the House that there will be no cutbacks in the current level of service. I have a letter with me this morning from one typical small service provider pointing out the financial implications of the decision and advising clients that, inevitably, this will have an effect on the level of service. Will the Tánaiste clarify to the House that——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	37	That is not appropriate to the Order of Business. As I pointed out to Deputy Kenny, the matter was discussed for two hours yesterday in the House, and the Deputy will have to find another way of raising it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	38	People who have their relatives and loved ones in such homes require reassurance, and all I ask is that——
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Yes.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The correct way to seek reassurance in this House is to submit the question in the appropriate way to the responsible Minister rather than on the Order of Business, which deals exclusively with legislation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I was about to sit down. I was happy that I had asked the question and that the Tánaiste could give the assurance that I sought equally speedily.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I ask the Deputy not to pursue the matter in this way. The Deputy has any number of opportunities. He has Leaders' Questions two days a week and debates on the Adjournment. There are other ways in which the matter can be raised. I ask the Deputy not to pursue it in a way that is totally out of order. I call Deputy Sargent.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Perhaps I might ask the Tánaiste if she considers that it will be necessary to bring a Supplementary Estimate before the House to assure people in care in such circumstances that there will be no reduction in the current level of service.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Is a Supplementary Estimate necessary?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Yes, I believe that it will be necessary to bring a Supplementary Estimate before the House. The health Vote for 2005 could not sustain the repayment of moneys in excess of €500 million. That would be grossly unfair on services. As the Deputy has acknowledged, it would involve a serious cutback in existing services if we took it from the current Vote. I anticipate that the Government will bring forward a Supplementary Estimate later this year.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Can I take it that the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate will be to ensure that there will be no diminution in the level of care for people in such circumstances?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	47	We cannot discuss the content of the Supplementary Estimate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I understand that the Tánaiste has——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The question is not appropriate to the Order of Business.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I respect the Ceann Comhairle's decision in not allowing me to seek the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31, but perhaps the Tánaiste will say whether the Government had information about that missing separated plutonium.Regarding promised legislation, will the Dublin metro Bill now be changed to the Meath metro Bill in view of the Minister for Transport's state of flux regarding where it will be located and whether it will be decided before 11 March? That is what people will be interested to know. On foot of the Law Reform Commission publishing two reports highlighting the need for regulation of charities, will the Tánaiste accept a bet that there will be no legislation regulating charities as long as there is a Fianna Fáil Government?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The Deputy raised the charities Bill on Tuesday and his question was answered.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Since 1990 and the Costello reforms, Fianna Fáil has not introduced a charities regulation since it would affect their fundraising too much.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	53	On the metro Bill, I call the Tánaiste.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I ask the Tánaiste whether she will accept that wager.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I do not envisage a Dublin metro Bill or a Meath metro Bill in the foreseeable future. For the charities Bill, 2005 is the expected date.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	56	When will the family law Bill come before the House?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	57	That Bill will be published this year.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	58	When will the employment permits Bill be brought before the House? There is a major strike in Mullingar, and I am dealing with a non-national currently residing in this country who is very vulnerable, so much so that when he tried to stand up for his rights, he was sacked on the spot and told to leave his accommodation.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I am sorry, Deputy, but it does not arise on the Order of Business.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	60	This type of thing happened to our people in past decades. Are we to stand by and allow non-residents and some of our own——

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I will not stand for the exploitation of any worker who is paid one third of a wage. I remember being in England when some of those who exploited me on building sites were Irish.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	126	When the debate adjourned yesterday I had begun to examine some of the specific provisions of the Bill and I had made reference in particular to child benefit. I mentioned the fact that while specific increases were made this year, they followed on significant increases made in previous years. That recognised the fact that a family with three children now gets almost €450 a month or an annual payment in child benefit of just under €5,500. The issue has frequently been raised that child benefit should be means tested or capped, and I refer specifically to the Minister's statement, with which I agree, that this is one of the few payments that is not taxable, assessed as means or as secondary benefit and is usually paid to the mother. We hear of people having a particular salary but it is not good enough to measure salary in those terms. It is the disposable income available to them. People may have a large income but if they have a large mortgage to pay, their disposable income may not be significant. In that case this money is of major importance and benefit. I suggest a word of caution is appropriate in that regard.I want to refer to the area of carers' benefit and the respite grant scheme. The package in this Bill commits an additional spending of €35 million for carers and also allows more carers to qualify for entitlements. The respite care grant is being increased from €835 per annum to €1,000, and a total of almost 33,000 full-time carers are expected to receive the grant this year. I share the view of previous speakers who indicated that this figure might be underestimated. When the new conditions are put in place, that figure could be exceeded.The respite care grant is being extended to include all carers who provide full-time care, subject to their not being employed for more than ten hours per week, in receipt of an unemployment payment or signing for unemployment credits. It is estimated that this will increase the number of full-time carers by 9,000. There are some who believe this could be further enlarged.I welcome the fact that income limits relating to carer's allowance have also been changed. The Bill expands the income limits for carer's allowance by increasing the weekly means test income disregard by €20 to €270 for a single person and by €40 to €500 for a couple. This means a couple with two children can earn up to just over €30,000 and receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple could earn €49,000 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance, while being able to access other items such as free travel, the household benefits package of free schemes and the respite care grant.I do not wish merely to discuss the various improvements being introduced. This debate gives us the opportunity to consider the operation of some of the schemes. I will comment briefly on something that came to my attention in recent weeks in respect of carer's benefit. One of my children has been in Our Lady's Hospital since before Christmas and I have visited the hospital on a daily basis. I met parents from all parts of the country at the hospital who are in a situation similar to mine and who have been obliged to spend considerable periods there.I would like the Minister to examine a particular difficulty in respect of the carer's benefit. If a parent has a child who is at home and ill for an extended period, he or she can apply for carer's leave and carer's benefit. If that child is subsequently hospitalised for a period of up to 13 weeks, the parent can retain the benefit. It appears, however, that if the child's illness commences with a hospital stay, the parents do not qualify for carer's benefit until she returns home. If the hospital stay is short, this does not present a major difficulty. However, I met a number of people from areas throughout the country whose children have been in Our Lady's Hospital for extended periods. An extended period is anything from four, five or six weeks. The hospital stays of the children of some of the parents to whom I refer had reached double figures in terms of weeks.Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin could not survive or continue to operate without the active involvement of parents. Considerable difficulties are imposed on parents from rural areas who are obliged to accompany their children to the hospital and remain there with them. I accept that great improvements have been made in facilities at the hospital but parents from rural areas are obliged to give up work, leave their families and reside in or around Our Lady's Hospital. These people either sleep on mats on the floor beside their children's beds or they sleep in the new wing, the "Ronald McDonald House" as it is called.There appears to be an anomaly in that the parents of children whose illness commences with a hospital stay do not qualify immediately for carer's benefit. If the illness begins at home, they qualify for the benefit and if a subsequent hospital stay lasts up to 13 weeks, they retain it. I ask the Minister to consider the position in respect of parents whose children are kept in hospital for extended periods. The hospital could not survive were it not for the work done by these parents. Young children cannot be left on their own and there are not sufficient staff numbers at the hospital to provide one to one care there. I ask the Minister to examine the position.I wish now to deal with the capital disregards for means tests. There has been a great deal of debate in recent times about those who invested income in SSIAs. As the Minister recognises — we have discussed this matter previously — people who invested modest amounts of money in SSIAs were concerned they would lose some of their benefits by the time their accounts matured. Increasing the disregard from €12,500 to €20,000 will improve the position dramatically. The enhanced disregard applies to all capital, regardless of whether it is held in SSIAs or other accounts. Members of the public should be aware that the disregard does not apply solely to SSIAs. If they have other capital tied up elsewhere, it will be added to what is contained in their SSIAs. Most of those who are on social welfare payments and who have invested only in SSIAs will not lose any of their entitlements. This represents a significant improvement and shows the Minister listened to those who had concerns. People were not too worried when the SSIA scheme first came into place but they have become concerned as the maturation date draws near.I compliment the Minister and the Minister for Finance as regards this year's social welfare budget which has increased by 9%, a figure far in excess of the rate of inflation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	127	What about the 16 cutbacks that were not reversed?
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I propose to share time with Deputy Perry.I congratulate the Minister on the improvements in the social welfare budget. It would be foolish to state that we do not welcome the increases being put in place. If one compares the position now to that which obtained a few years ago, one can see there has been a major improvement. However, one cannot ignore the fact that the cost of living has increased dramatically. I represent a rural constituency and I know the cost of transport, etc., has risen significantly. For example, health boards no longer supply taxi services for people obliged to attend hospitals or whatever and these people must pay for their transport out of their old age pensions. When one takes this into account, one can see that the sum of money available to pensioners is not all that fantastic. The position is even worse for someone who is obliged to pay money out of a disability pension. When one considers the situation of someone who must attend regularly at a psychiatric hospital to avail of support services, one realises that these increases are necessary in order to cover increases in the cost of living.I will comment on two specific issues. The first of these is the carer's allowance. For two years I served as a member of an all-party study group appointed by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and I am extremely annoyed that more action was not taken in respect of the unanimous proposals put forward by that group in respect of carers. I welcome the fact that the respite grant will be made available to all carers. At least that is what the Minister stated. However, he also referred to a specific number, namely, 9,300. I cannot honestly understand how this low figure for the additional number of carers was arrived at. Even when it is added to the existing figure for carers, the final figure will fall a long way short of what any of the carers' organisations have suggested as being the real number of carers.What criteria will apply to those who will be given the €1,000 respite grant? Will the grant be dealt with in the same way as carer's allowance? For example, a small farmer living in a rural area who cares for his aged father or mother or perhaps a disabled brother or sister and who is obliged to spend more than ten hours looking after his cattle is not entitled to carer's allowance. If he gave up the farm and worked for ten hours at a job in Dublin, the time spent travelling back and forward between Monaghan and Dublin would not be taken into account. However, when he travels from one out-farm to another, the time is taken into account. I am familiar with such a case due to come before an appeals officer in the coming weeks.Those who give care to the elderly and who are told they are entitled to a respite grant should get it without too much questioning or red tape. Without them there would be a much greater problem than the one discussed last night in the House for a number of hours, namely, those at home. I want the Minister to take a serious look at the whole issue of those, in rural Ireland especially, who care for the elderly. When the means disregard was first introduced some degree of comment was made by the social welfare inspectors. If it was clear a person was giving full-time care, along with looking after a few cattle, then it was given. Suddenly new criteria were introduced under which the number of minutes and hours spent dealing with each animal had to be accounted for. As a result, people were prevented from getting the carer's allowance. This is serious and puts enormous pressure on people living in isolated areas.I was given an assurance by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, that this would be reviewed. However it is clear from this Bill, the announcements on social welfare in the budget and anything I have seen so far that nothing has been reviewed in this regard.The other area relevant to carers, discussed  ad nauseam, was the issue of widows and widowers. If they are working outside the home and get ill they are entitled to half rate disability. However, if they are looking after loved ones in the home and getting a widow’s or widower’s contributory pension, as most are nowadays, they are not entitled to any carer’s allowance. The Joint Committee of Social and Family Affairs put forward the suggestion that at least the work such people do should be recognised by giving them a half rate pension. I urge the Minister to review that. There was total and absolute unanimity among committee members that this issue should be dealt with, but nothing happened.Farm assist is another issue I want to mention in passing. When the means test was introduced a number of years ago, it was supposed to provide for about 25,000 cases immediately. The actual figure was between 8,000 and 8,500 and there will be less from now on because of the movement in the direction of the rural employment scheme. Again, there are major question marks as people are literally afraid to go to social welfare inspectors because of the way the means test is carried out. Their books are ignored. The mythical idea exists that because someone has so many animals or whatever, the costs are the same as everyone else's, so therefore the person is earning x amount. Every farm is different and should be treated individually. I welcome the changes in the money a person is allowed to have in his or her bank, home or whatever. That is something the former Fine Gael spokesman on social welfare, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and I fought through this House, against the arrogance of the former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. I was pleased it was clear that at least the civil servants who sit behind the barrier in the House, were listening to us at that period and eventually introduced a realistic level of moneys that could be kept in a bank by someone on non-contributory social welfare. It means people are not hiding money under the mattress or leaving it somewhere where it is vulnerable to robbery. I realise this measure relates to investment bonds more than anything else, but it is an improvement that I welcome. I also welcome the measures as regards cross-Border activity, and that people may derive some benefits for working or living in a different state.One cannot take the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill on its own, however. In my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 medical cards have been removed from people in the last seven years. We were promised that 30,000 extra cards would be given nationally. However, the removal of medical cards has significant cost implications for the low paid and those in poor circumstances. We do not just want 200,000 medical cards replaced, as promised. We want those which have already been withdrawn to be replaced as well by changing the means test to a realistic and reasonable level, taking into account cancer sufferers and people with long-term illnesses who are not currently entitled to medical cards as of right.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I thank Deputy Crawford for sharing time. This is an important Bill. Deputy Crawford spoke about carers. The increase in respite grants is welcome, as is the removal of the anomaly whereby a person caring for more than two people did not receive the grant in respect of each care recipient. It was about time that anomaly was removed and it is significant that it has been done.The means disregard for carer's allowance will result in an additional 1,000 new carers qualifying for payments. The number of carers in receipt of carer's allowance will increase from 23,500 in 2004 to 24,500 in 2005. However, it is believed that there are 50,000 full-time carers, which means that some 25,000 of them will get nothing. Given the major issue that is currently being debated and the cost of yesterday's Supreme Court judgment as regards nursing home inmates, and the cost to the State as regards retrospective payments, the invaluable work done by carers who look after the elderly in their own homes for so little is put in context.I hope the Minister will look carefully at the recommendations on giving people assistance to care for their parents and grandparents in their homes by ensuring proper facilities and grants are put in place. It would be a good investment. Regrettably, elderly people were in receipt of very little in the way of grants for essential modifications to their homes. When one sees so many people in long-term care, it is regrettable that the State has been so mean-spirited about helping them as regards essential ground floor modifications, bathroom facilities etc. I know from my experience as a former member of a local authority, that the difficulty presented by the matching funds stipulation prevented councils from implementing such initiatives. Given the Supreme Court judgment, however, I have no doubt that care of the aged is now very much part of the political landscape. As regards subvention, the issue yesterday was contract beds. The issue from now on will demand close scrutiny of the rights to pensions, subventions and maintenance in tandem with payments by family members.Yesterday, the Tánaiste said that given the demographics, care of the aged will be an increasing priority for the foreseeable future, with some 12,000 additional people in this category within the next two years. I appeal to Government to look imaginatively at its care for the aged programme with particular emphasis on people's own homes where much of the work can effectively be done.The issue of medical cards is also significant. The number of people with medical cards continues to drop, despite promises to have the number extended to an extra 200,000 people. The Taoiseach said yesterday that doctor-only medical cards would not be available until April 2005 and that 30,000 people who were supposed to receive the traditional medical card would also have to wait. That is not good enough. There is a great number of people who need medical attention and who just cannot go to the doctor. At least the GP card system is a start and will alleviate the cost of the GP, but we should take prescription costs for the pharmacy into account. Regrettably, there are many people with young children who are caught in the income trap. We are in a two tier economy, where people are working very hard, paying for the education of their families and still just cannot get any assistance from the State. It is quite extraordinary that it is taking so long to issue the 30,000 medical cards.From my experience as a Deputy for Sligo-Leitrim, I know the level of applications that are being sent in and thrown out. There is an audit for medical cards every 18 months and there is an increasing number of people being taken off the list. That is wrong. There is no sense of concern for the position in which some people find themselves. The audit is based on gross income, but there is a huge difference between a gross and a net salary. Regrettably, many of the thresholds for medical entitlements are based on gross income. People who are paying for the education of their family and need two incomes to do so, still do not qualify for real benefits based on their gross salary. There is pressure on many people who genuinely feel the medical card system needs to be examined. Up to 1,000 people in Sligo should have qualified for the traditional medical card, yet those cards have not been issued. If we include the doctor-only medical card, that would mean up to 5,000 cards should be issued in Sligo. I call on the Minister to issue those cards as quickly as possible as there is pressure on people who genuinely need to go to the doctor and who cannot afford to do so.The poverty statistics are quite startling. A recent EU report revealed that Irish women are at greater risk of poverty than their counterparts in any other EU member state. A total of 23% of Irish women are at risk of poverty. The CSO recently published a report which estimated that approximately 120,000 children and over 23,000 lone parent households are living in consistent poverty. To put this into context, these are children who may not have a winter coat and who cannot afford to have a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day. Ireland is among those member states with a greater gap between the rich and poor. This country is undoubtedly a two-tier economy, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Over 50,000 households are on waiting lists for social housing according to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. In the city of Sligo, there are over 500 people on a waiting list for local authority housing. The number is similar for those waiting for housing from the county council. The estimated number of homeless households remains high at 3,773 in 2002, in comparison to 3,743 in 1999. When we had the money during the boom, the homeless were effectively ignored and the position worsened.Another recent study found that the number of children living in housing that is overcrowded, damp, in disrepair and in poor neighbourhoods has more than doubled between 1991 and 2002. As many as 243,000 children in 94,000 households are at risk of experiencing such detrimental living conditions. Children of lone parents are far more likely to experience nearly all of the housing problems cited. One third of lone parent families live in local authority housing compared with just 7% of couples with children. The impact of these issues on child welfare is manifest in their increased risk of psychological and general health and behavioural problems, all of which impact on their education, health and sense of well-being.I am delighted to speak on this very important Bill. The Minister is well aware of the issues and I acknowledge that he has worked on the savage 16 cuts. I am quite happy that he is getting into his brief and I hope he will work on some of the major difficulties facing the welfare society in the country at this time.

While the Opposition has a role to play regarding issues that are still not addressed, I must take the opportunity to welcome the fact that this Bill is here for the purpose of implementing the €874 million social welfare package that was announced in the last budget. When the current Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, came in with a package of €630 million, people were bowled over by the size of the increase at that time. We now have got a 40% increase of €244 million which brings the total spend up to €12.25 billion. When we speak of numbers in this fashion, it becomes a kind of tragedy as we cannot take on-board such an amount of money. If we spoke about thousands or ten of thousands of euro, then it might mean more. However, €12.25 billion is a huge amount of money to spend. The fact that it is being spent on social welfare means the priority of the Government is to try to get the money to those who need it most. Of all Departments, the Department of Social and Family Affairs deals specifically with those who are in difficulty, be it the unemployed, the elderly, the very young or the disabled.I would love to have a position where most social welfare payments for the unemployed were not needed in my constituency. I would particularly like to have a situation where we did not need unemployment assistance. I always speak of the concept of joined-up government and I want to take the opportunity of congratulating FÁS and the different schemes that are running to deal with the unemployment issue in the textile industry. I want to encourage the Minister to talk to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about Donegal and its needs so that the spending level on employment assistance can be reduced and people can be assisted instead in finding new employment. I recognise that a task force met with more than half the Cabinet last week. I trust it will move on to something that will be seen to be useful for the constituency I represent.The doubling of spending since 1997 speaks for itself. It is important to recognise the very positive actions being taken when we consider the sums being spent. In this context, I acknowledge the work of the CWO which, especially in my local area, reacts to the individual rather than to a rule in a book. This is in keeping with the policy the Minister outlined in his speech and it is something which must continue. There is no issue in Donegal. If a person approaches the CWO with a genuine concern, he or she receives a fair hearing.The issue of the exchange rate between the euro, sterling and dollar is difficult to explain to people who do not come from areas in which one frequently uses more than one currency. Exchange rate fluctuations make it appear on paper that people are gaining and losing in terms of the cash they have. However, if a person in a Border area receives a cheque in sterling, he or she may spend it in a shop in the North. To him or her, spending £20 in a shop in the North is the same as spending €20 in a shop in Donegal. Therefore, while the Department considers sterling to be more valuable, the individual does not because if he or she does not exchange it for euro, he or she will not see the cash difference. The exchange rate is one of the most significant issues raised with me. Much the same is true of education grants. If a person receives a grant in Belfast, how well he or she does depends on the exchange rate on the day.I welcome the increases in child benefit as the payment accounts for 66% of child income support provision. In 1994, it constituted less than 30%. Child care is even more topical following the recent controversial article by Kevin Myers in The Irish Times. The Minister alluded to lone parents who support children while trying to get back to education. While it is important to help people to move into the workforce, there is another side to the equation involving the people already in employment who spend significant sums on child care. I am not sure child benefit payment is used to pay for child care in crèches. There should be a tax relief for child care, which is a matter for the Minister for Finance.I would like to think in the context of debate over the last week that people in employment will be considered as well as those trying to access employment. We want to move away from a system which makes it disadvantageous to work. People in employment are still considering that if they did not work they would obtain medical cards and a range of supports. No matter how often we explain that certain supports are not that exciting, the problem is that the Government has made some of them very worthwhile. We are almost the victims of our own success in this area.I will not detail the level of children's allowance payment, but it is significantly greater than the 25p per week rate in the days I first came to the House.A provision of €35 million has been made to enhance supports for carers. The introduction by a previous Minister in the Department, Deputy Dermot Ahern, of the respite grant was significant and its extension is very important. There are many other elements in the legislation which I do not think I will have time to address. Changes in the bereavement grant are important as is the decision to make orphan's payment directly to persons over 18 who do not reside with guardians. It is also important to encourage people to think about their pensions. While none of us thinks he or she will get old, it is necessary to point out that only 43% of women in the State have pensions. People in their 20s are failing to make any pension provision.There is a social dimension to the current state of the contract the Department of Social and Family Affairs has with post offices. I raised the issue a number of years ago when it came up, but the matter seemed to settle. There is a current threat that the contract will be revoked despite the fact the EU decision will have no real influence on whether social welfare payments can be made through the local post office network. The local post office in Carrowmena has been in the hands of the same family for 100 years. They are very proud of it and it is very much part of the fabric of the tiny village of Cloghan. We cannot sit and do nothing for five years while people die off according to the age profile involved. If they die off, it will be in the context of haphazard post office provision.The Minister must talk to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ensure we have a vibrant post office service into the future. As people are paid by transaction, if there are few transactions, they will not receive adequate incomes. Many seem to live on practically nothing. It is important to guarantee a minimum wage to the operators of post offices which do not seem to be viable. We must decide whether a social service is involved and maximise the number of jobs that can be done through a post office. The Government did that in the past and was been able to direct payments to be made.It has been contended that 20 cent or 30 cent is saved per transaction by putting payments through banks, but the recipient pays 30 cent at an automated teller machine to take money out. It is a question of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I make a plea to reverse the decision.The Minister should also talk to the Minister for Transport about the rural transport scheme and continue to consider all-Ireland transport networks.As Deputy Perry said, gross and net salaries are very different and impact on how far one's payments go and on the numbers eligible for medical cards.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I thank Deputy Keaveney for sharing time. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the very important Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005.The legislation is necessary to implement the measures announced in this year's budget. As every Member will recall, the Minister for Finance signalled in his Budget Statement dramatic changes and increases in social welfare payments. As I have said before, many people have benefited from the extraordinary growth which has occurred over the past five years. Increased prosperity is evident across Ireland in the number of new houses and the record level of commercial activity. More people than ever are working and the economic statistics indicate that ours is one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. It is true, however, that not all citizens have benefited to the same extent from economic growth. It is a fundamental aspect of democracy that a state must look after the less well-off. The social welfare system is one of the methods which allows those in need of help for whatever reason to avail of it.The changes the Bill introduces are most welcome and will be of great benefit to those availing of various social welfare benefits. I echo Deputy Haughey's plea last night and ask the Minister to consider ways to simplify the social welfare system. There are many different benefit titles including "disability payment" and "invalidity pension". It is rather confusing and perhaps there might be some method by which it could be simplified in the future.The €10 increase in child benefit for first and second children and the increase of €12 for third and subsequent children means child benefit is now €141.40 per month for each first and second child and €177.30 for each third and subsequent child. Child benefit is generally recognised as one of the best, if not the best, method of helping families. It shows this Government is indeed family friendly.The modern family exists in many different units. The traditional model of two parents married to each other is still enormously prevalent. However, it is important to recognise there are other family manifestations, such as lone parents or couples cohabiting, in which there are children. The State has a duty to cherish all children equally. By paying child benefit, the money can be used by the parent or parents, as the case may be, to ensure the children get all they need.I note, with some interest, the statements by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, with regard to his policy to help reform the lone parent payment. He has obviously brought his reforming zeal with him to this most important Ministry. Many lone parents are caught in the poverty trap and must forgo educational or work opportunities. Rearing a child when two parents are involved can be difficult at the best of times; doing so on one's own is many times more difficult. All parents are aware of how stressful it can be when one's child is sick, for example. How much more difficult must it be when a parent, for whatever reason, is on their own? It is much more difficult not to have a spouse or partner with whom one can discuss issues regarding one's child or to have no one to turn to for help when one's child is ill. Many lone parents make great sacrifices in terms of continuing their education or getting involved in the workplace. With the growth in the economy, many mothers have returned to work. However, in the case of lone parents this is not easily done. As a result, many lone parents are forced to abandon education or the workplace in order to look after their child.For these reasons, I welcome the commitment given by the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to examine the issue. A group which is currently examining these issues will make its report early in the second half of this year. The group includes representatives of six different Departments and the Minister has indicated he will give top priority to its findings. I look forward to the debate and the resulting actions which will follow publication of the findings.Lone parents do not choose to be in their situation. It is important to allow all lone parents the opportunity to progress in education or the workplace if they so choose. They must not be forced back into work or education, but given the choice. In that regard, it is quite startling to discover that more than 50% of lone parents have not progressed beyond primary level education. However, that is a debate to which we will return later.I welcome the increase in the respite care grant, which will come into effect from next June. The grant will increase from €835 to €1,000 per annum, and will be payable in respect of each care recipient. In the past, carers have had little or no recognition for their superb work. It is difficult and places enormous demands both on the carer and immediate family. In many instances, by opting to provide care for their family member, a carer is helping keep somebody out of long-term institutional care which can be of great cost to the State. Following yesterday's Supreme Court judgment, it will probably cost a lot more.The Carers' Association argues the financial saving to the State is considerable, and I agree with this. The argument deals only with the financial side and does not take account of the great benefit to the person who is being cared for in terms of the love, respect and happiness that ensues from being in one's own home. Most, if not all, people wish to be at home, but can only remain there because of the commitment of the carer. As a result of the improvement in respite care grant qualifications, approximately 33,000 people will receive the grant this year.I welcome the Minister's undertaking that he will examine section 6 in more detail on Committee Stage. The linking up of access to the carer's benefit with previous employment is complex, and I look forward to his proposals.The proposal to increase the amount of capital disregard for the purposes of means tested social welfare schemes from €12,600 to €20,000 is most welcome. It will have many positive benefits, not least in regard to the issue of SSIAs, which will start to mature in the near future. The Bill gives effect to the changes not already covered by the Social Welfare Bill of a couple of months ago. It maintains the progressive thrust of this Government and especially the forward thinking of the Minister, Deputy Brennan. I commend the Bill to the House.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005. I stated on a previous occasion that I welcomed the €14 per week increase for recipients of the long-term rates of welfare payments and the €12 increase for pensions. However, this is the very minimum that people could expect to receive, given the finances available to the Minister of Finance at the end of 2004. For example, tax receipts for last year were €1.7 billion above expectations. Many of the increases did not meet the expectations of the various groups working on the ground on a daily basis with vulnerable people.The media would indicate there was a €12 to €14 increase in pensions. I received a telephone call yesterday afternoon from a constituent who receives a pre-retirement allowance and whose wife is on an invalidity pension. He was informed that his increase for the coming year would be 30 cent per week. The Minister should look at that situation, because these people must live in the same environment as the rest of us.We are one of the richest countries in Europe. However, are we an inclusive country? The test of this is how we encompass the most vulnerable in our society. It is a cause of great concern that significant minorities still do not have the basic necessities to live on a daily basis, such as food or clothing. The increase in relative poverty and the widening gap between those on welfare and low incomes and the remainder of our society reflects badly on many of the policies and legislation enacted by this Government in recent years. Almost 800,000 of the population are below 60% of the median income and are experiencing basic deprivation. The increase of €14 is unlikely to drastically change the lifestyle of a person living on €148.80 per week who has no immediate prospect of securing a job or a local authority house. Having listened to the contributions by Government speakers, it seems they are not living in the real world. I am confident that they will get a rude awakening when they knock on doors during the two by-election campaigns in Meath and Kildare North over the coming weeks.The increases provided for in this Bill amount to approximately €2 per day, a sum one might often throw into a collection box as a contribution. Since 1 January 2005, increased rents for local authority houses have impacted on those fortunate enough to be accommodated in this manner. The increases will amount, at least, to €1.60 per week, on top of which people will have to endure an ever-increasing range of stealth taxes, including price rises for fuel, food and ESB charges to name but a few. We have a relatively low-tax economy but our stealth charges are among the highest.This year, for the first time, many older people, welfare recipients and low-income earners have been hit by an additional charge in the form of waste charges imposed by local authority county managers. This charge is unfair and represents a hardship for people in these categories. I have no difficulty with waste charges in context but it is unfair to impose them on people who are unable to pay. The Labour Party believes that a national waiver scheme should be introduced. It is most unfair that people whose waste is collected by a private operator have no waiver facility, while local authorities which retain waste collection in public ownership provide a waiver scheme on grounds of hardship. Such local authority waiver schemes may vary but at least they are available.My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, introduced the Labour Party's Private Members' motion on the national waiver scheme on Tuesday. The motion, however, was voted down by the Government parties last night, which was a disgrace. Deputy Gilmore outlined how such a scheme could be administered through the Department of Social and Family Affairs.In its pre-budget submission, the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament stated:The charges for refuse removal in local authority areas have a serious impact on the disposable income of older people. This arises from the lack of uniformity in waiver systems in the different local authority areas. Where local authorities continue to collect refuse there is a waiver and where it is collected privately there is no waiver.The Senior Citizens' Parliament is calling on the Government to introduce a national waiver system similar to the one which used to operate in Dublin City Council. It operates in my area of Fingal County Council where people who are not liable for income tax receive a waiver. The Minister and his Department should examine such a mechanism. It would be realistic to introduce a scheme to cover the groups of people to which I referred earlier. Alternatively, tax credits could be made available for those working on low incomes. A range of issues could be used to deal with this matter, so I implore the Minister to examine the options. Before the year is out, he should try to introduce a scheme to bring fairness to people in need, particularly the elderly and those on low incomes who have not been able to avail of a waiver for waste collection charges in certain areas.In November 2003, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, introduced the so-called "savage 16" cuts. These individual cuts caused, and continue to cause, widespread consequences for welfare recipients and people at work. One of the cuts discontinued the half-rate unemployment benefit for those in receipt of a widow's or widower's pension, or one-family payments. However, it was fully rescinded by the Minister shortly afterwards following unrelenting opposition pressure in the House and in the media by widows' and lone parents' groups. I must acknowledge that some Fianna Fáil backbenchers also supported us on that point and the Minister then relented.When Deputy Brennan became Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I got the impression, having read the newspapers, that he intended to rescind the remaining 15 cuts. It is worth putting on record the situation following the Minister's review. As regards unemployment benefit, the underlying number of paid contributions from insurable employment increased from 39 to 52. That also applies to disability benefit and health and safety benefit, so there was no change.Unemployment benefit payment was reduced from 390 to 312 days where a person has paid less than 260 PRSI contributions since first entering employment. There was no change in that case either.The weekly earnings threshold to qualify for unemployment benefit was raised from €88.88 to €150. This also applied to disability benefit. To the best of my knowledge, this represented no change.There has been an increase in the period where claims are linked with a previous claim for unemployment benefit. This is important for people who fall ill while working. Previously the period was 13 weeks but it has been increased to 26 weeks. It also applies to disability benefit, so there has been no change.There has been a small change in the next category: the payment of a half-rate, child dependant allowance was discontinued where a claimant's spouse or partner's gross weekly income is over €300. This also applies to disability benefit and health and safety benefit. In this case, the weekly income limit was increased by €50 to €350.There has been no change in the social welfare allowance rent or mortgage supplement. Personal contributions were increased by €1.30 per week. As regards the mortgage supplement, where one partner is in full-time employment, both are excluded from claiming. There is no change in this case but it has been referred to the social partners' working group. It is easy for the Minister to do that but as I have stated on numerous occasions, both to the current Minister and his predecessor, this matter must be re-examined. Given the lack of local authority housing and the fact that the number of applicants for such accommodation has tripled since the Government took office, these difficulties must be tackled. People on low incomes who wish to live together and continue working, may be in private rented accommodation. However, if one of them is working and, even if he or she is only earning the minimum wage, rent supplement will not be provided. This needs to be addressed. I acknowledge the little movement on the other cutbacks. The Minister should conduct a further review of these cutbacks to improve the lot of those affected, particularly those in low paid employment.I refer to the role of carers in society and the manner in which the State has responded. I compliment the Minister on the improvements he has provided for in the legislation, in particular, the increase in the annual respite grant to €1,000 and the amendment to the assessment of capital means for certain assistance payments. I would have substantially increased the number of carers qualifying under the carer's allowance and benefit schemes.Up to relatively recently, the carer's role has been largely defined by tradition, culture and religious factors incorporating concepts of self-sacrifice, duty and acceptance. Thankfully, this attitude has changed and carers are emerging as people who wish to care for their loved ones but who are increasingly angry about the lack of recognition, service and support for their role. Given the number of carers providing such support and the resultant saving to the State, they are still angry that more of them are not being recognised.The entitlement to the respite care grant will be extended to persons providing full-time care. Thousands of carers provide care 24 hours a day and they are not eligible for this grant for a number of reasons. They might have an income or they might be in receipt of a second welfare payment or their spouses might have a pension from a previous employer. However, these carers provide a 24 hour service on a daily basis. Will they be entitled to the respite care grant following the changes to the scheme? If so, how does the Minister propose to advertise this and bring it to their attention that they may fall into this category?The recent article in The Irish Times by Kevin Myers labelling children of lone parents as bastards was utterly offensive, regrettable and inaccurate and it was an attack on children. I totally accept the apology subsequently given by Mr. Myers on this matter, but the presentation and tone of the article took from an issue that must be addressed. I welcome the Minister’s initiative to address this issue, although he has not given many details regarding how he intends to do so. Lone parents must be provided with an opportunity to return to the workforce and improve their educational qualifications. Many of them only have basic first level education. Generally they have one or two children and the issue of providing them with opportunities to better themselves in terms of education and returning to the workforce must be examined. The Minister will have my support and that of my party in analysing this issue. We might not reach a consensus but the issue must be addressed.I have difficulties with the legislation. Considering the budget available, the commitments entered into by the Government prior to the 2002 general election on pensions and child benefit still have not been met. The Minister could have done more on these and other issues. We still have difficulties with the legislation and we will oppose it.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I wish to share time with Deputy Dan Wallace.I welcome the opportunity to discuss social welfare issues, which impact on many people's lives, including lone parents and pensioners. Kevin Myers's article in  The Irish Times did significant damage and it hurt many people, particularly lone parents and their children. Such articles do nobody a service, as they inflame emotions and stigmatise large sectors of our society. However, I acknowledge his apology a number of days later.I welcome the Minister's proposed review of the lone parents issue. Steps have been taken in recent years regarding the retention of the lone parent book and providing lone parents with the opportunity to enter the workplace. However, a fundamental poverty trap remains and this must be analysed in detail. Conclusions must be reached regarding how best to address it. A lone parent is often isolated in private rented accommodation or local authority housing without the support structure normally provided by a family and this has a negative effect on the ability of people to raise families.Local authorities must recognise this and, when housing is allocated, decisions must be reached which do not result in a load of lone parents being placed in one section of an estate with two parent families placed in another section. Nobody benefits from this. Local authorities should ensure housing is allocated to a cross-section of people. They should design mixed schemes so lone parents are allocated housing beside two parent families and elderly people. For example, elderly people could assist them in child minding and provide them with advice and expertise. If the current policy is pursued, many people will not have an opportunity. The Minister has acknowledged this and will address it in the review.Whatever the review throws up, the housing policies of local authorities do not take account of varying demographics. The educational qualifications of many lone parents do not meet the modern day requirement to enter the workplace. This issue must be addressed quickly because not only will the lone parent be consigned to poverty if his or her educational standard is not enhanced, his or her children will also be consigned to poverty.That is evident in our communities at present. I suggest that whatever schemes are put in place, incentives are provided to encourage lone parents to return to education or get involved in training schemes. When people with a low level of education become lone parents, the State should afford them an opportunity to return to education. If incentives are required they should be put in place to ensure that when children are older their parents get an opportunity to return to the workplace. People who have access to education are more likely to be in a position to find work. To date that is an area in which we have failed. Various schemes are in place to get people back to education but we have to take a more positive and proactive approach to the issue.Child care is another matter of concern. I am amazed at how local authorities continually refuse planning permission for small child care facilities in housing estates. I am at a loss as to why they do not grant planning permission to people who want to convert their living rooms or garages to establish child care facilities for four, five or six children. The argument against giving planning permission is that the proposed developments are not in keeping with a residential environment, that they should be elsewhere. I contend that child care facilities should be available in the estates in which people live so that they have easy access to them. People without cars or a great deal of money cannot access child care because child care facilities are not permitted to be built in the areas in which they are most needed. Planning regulations are at fault in the majority of cases.I congratulate the Minister for addressing concerns regarding SSIAs. It is a positive step that has alleviated many concerns of people on social welfare payments who have SSIAs. I welcome the increase in the disregard to €20,000.The Minister is bringing forward a recovery of overpayments provision. Section 21 provides that the approach to recovery, from current or future social welfare payments, of overpaid amounts will be prescribed in regulations. Nobody condones people who abuse or rip-off the social welfare system but where people have received overpayment for one reason or another, there must to be some form of flexibility to take into account the means people have at their disposal. I have seen many cases where the fault for overpayment lay with the Department. The recipients were unaware of what was taking place and assumed they were entitled to the money. When such mistakes are discovered the overpayment is claimed back which has led to significant anxiety and financial hardship on the recipient. I urge the Minister to introduce a flexible system that would take into account people's concerns about their ability to pay.The Supreme Court decision regarding reimbursements for nursing home payments may have significant implications for the public finances. I support any position the Government may take to try and secure moneys from elsewhere, other than the Department of Social and Family Affairs. We have made commitments and we should aim to distribute the fruits of the economy to those who most need it. We should closely examine accessing funding from the national pensions reserve fund on a once-off basis. The fund currently contains €11.5 billion. An extraordinary amount of money may have to be reimbursed to the families of people who were in State nursing homes. It has been acknowledged that a group of people was hard-done-by in the past and wrongfully treated. However, other groups should not be made to suffer as a result.We should try to come up with an arrangement whereby public finance commitments would be honoured, targets for social welfare payments would be met, taxes would be kept low, while at the same time we should try and ensure we meet our commitments in terms of the Supreme Court decision. I raised this point to stimulate discussion on how we can raise the money rather than simply by increasing income tax or cutting back on spending, which would be difficult in view of the commitments, demands and needs that exist in society, especially in regard to social welfare, health and education.I congratulate the Minister on his progress in the Department to date. He has grasped a few nettles and encouraged people into thought-provoking debate. I welcome the review of lone parent supports. While we are making some efforts to address the matter we must ensure we have a cohesive system in place that does not militate against lone parents seeking education, child care or access to the workplace when they so desire.
#DanWallace	unknown-#DanWallace-party	unknown-#DanWallace-dob	unknown-#DanWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I too pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on the initiatives he has taken and the foresight he has shown in terms of the social welfare code. I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.Most financial commentators, when addressing the annual budget, focus primarily on the impact on the economy of the various decisions announced by the Minister. We hear a great deal about the impact of taxation measures on take-home pay, and the effect of changes in reliefs and taxation policies on employers and large organisations. It is important to acknowledge that the decisions taken in recent years in various budgets have allowed our economy develop into one that is the envy of our European neighbours. It is equally important to acknowledge that we are in our current position because of sensible and prudent management of our finances. Those who are less well-off in society are equally affected by the decisions taken on budget day but the same level of focus and attention is not given to the impact of increases and changes in benefits to the lives of those who depend on social welfare. This Bill will give effect to many of these changes.It has been previously acknowledged that our ability to look after the less well-off in society is directly related to the level of growth in the economy. Because of the growth levels achieved in the economy generally, and other Government initiatives, additional funds are now available to cater for this sector of the community. We have a duty to deliver on the expectations that have been created. Real and telling increases in social welfare rates should be provided to help people who are dependant on the State for income.The budget for social welfare at €12 billion is the largest of any Department and it is vital that it is distributed in a manner that creates maximum impact for those in receipt of payments. Many organisations work to alleviate hardship among the less well-off in society and these organisations constantly articulate the needs of their clients and seek ongoing improvements in the rates of payment to ensure that we continue our aim to work towards narrowing the gap between rich and poor in society. The increase in benefits outlined in this Bill, are an acknowledgement of the role played by these organisations.One aspect of the Bill that is especially pleasing is the significant increase in child benefit payments. This benefit is vital because it is a real support for parents and is payable regardless of the status of the parent. It allows many parents to pay the necessary child care costs associated with remaining in the workforce, while for others it ensures they have the additional resources necessary to improve their quality of life. We must continue to improve this benefit in future years. l am glad the Minister shares my view in this regard, as he has indicated to the House.I welcome the fact that, in this his first social welfare Bill, the Minister has affirmed his commitment to carers, a sector of our community that continuously does Trojan work in homes across the country. In homes all over Ireland people are caring for family members, the elderly and people with disabilities in a compassionate way. They are doing so in a way that the State could never hope to match. They need our support for the difficult but worthwhile work which benefits the whole of society. The various provisions in the Bill will provide real assistance to carers through improvements in a variety of different measures. The Minister has also moved to allay the concerns of people with SSIA accounts that their savings might adversely affect their benefits. Under no circumstances should we place any disincentive in the way of people who have shown the foresight to avail of the scheme and build up a nest egg for eventualities. The increase in the means test disregard is a significant measure because it means people can now continue to save and avail of the full maturity value of their SSIA without having any concerns about the impact on their benefits. This measure will provide important peace of mind to such people.The second part of the Bill relates to pensions and the provision of adequate income into retirement for our current workforce. We hear a great deal about the pensions time-bomb and the fact that because of the current demographic profile of our population, we are likely to face a serious strain on our resources in future, with people living longer and the prospect of a smaller workforce having to support a larger retired population. The implications are obvious and I am pleased that the Minister identified this area as a priority in his speech. We need people to save more from an earlier age so that they will be independently wealthy in retirement. The incentives to individuals to save are quite significant with full tax relief available on contributions into the fund. We need an ongoing information campaign to encourage people to avail of these reliefs and build their own funds.The lone parents' allowance has been referred to and I am glad the Minister is examining this whole area. The best thing we can do is give examples to the Minister of how best he can make changes. As I have said so often at meetings of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, it is only when the anomalies in the system are brought to the notice of the Minister and his officials that they change. For example, a lady who is a lone parent with one child contacted me this week informing me that she had been advised by the Department that because she had increased her income from working, her lone parents allowance was being disallowed. She was further advised that if she worked two hours less per week she would retain that benefit. If a person is over the limit, will the Minister consider reducing the amounts by the corresponding increase? For example, if a person earns €20 or €30 more per week, his or her payment should only be reduced by that amount. The cut-off point is a disincentive. The lady to whom I refer is making great strides to provide for her child and yet the system mitigates against her.I have also referred to family income supplement during meetings of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, as Deputy Stanton will recall. The committee was unanimous in its view of the need for the Department to carry out an intensive awareness campaign on the family income supplement. It is an excellent payment for people with low incomes who are working and yet the numbers availing of it are quite small. I appeal to the Minister to give some attention to this matter and intensify the awareness campaign to let people know of their entitlements.This Bill should be acknowledged as one which has as its primary focus the requirement to cater for the needs of those most in need in society. The various measures contained in this Bill will help to alleviate hardship, offer hope and improve quality of life for many people from many different backgrounds. It will do so through the provision of better services and a fairer sharing of the available resources. There is no doubt that these measures will make a significant impact on poverty and will directly benefit the lives of many people. I support the Bill.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The details of the financial changes made across a range of social welfare payments have been well covered by this debate. I note the recognition from all sides that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has taken heed of the dissatisfaction which clearly existed among the electorate and within his party and has attempted to return Fianna Fáil, whatever about its Government partner, to a more socially responsive and caring image. At the very least, this has meant there has been no attempt to repeat some of the more blatant cutbacks witnessed in previous budgets.A number of Deputies referred to the difficulties of navigating through the regulations governing social welfare, and I concur with Deputy Haughey who admitted that it is only when confronted with a particular case that one realises just how complex they can be and how confusing it must be for those whose entitlements depend upon understanding and satisfying various provisions.I have dealt with a number of constituents who have lost out on their entitlements through a failure to understand or because the information was not readily at hand. Last year, I dealt with an elderly woman who had worked all her life abroad and had returned to this country. She was living on a totally inadequate income because she had not accessed the benefits to which she was entitled. In fairness to Department employees, they were extremely helpful and resolved the situation within a matter of hours. However, that situation and many others could be avoided if the system were simplified.The Minister referred to the proportion of Government spending which is devoted to social welfare spending and to the number of people who benefit from the various schemes. However, as my colleague, Deputy Crowe, pointed out, this has not led to any reduction in the gap between rich and poor, which continues to grow. There is a message in this for us to explore adequately the reasons for it.One of the reasons, apart from the level of direct payments, has been the failure to assist people who are dependent on social welfare to escape from poverty. We witnessed a series of cutbacks in the back to work, community and education support schemes, as well as changes that affected access to child care for social welfare dependants participating in such schemes. Those cuts continue to have an effect on people who were forced to give up schemes that held out some promise of their being able to enter full-time work or education.I recognise that the Minister has attempted to undo some of the damage done by introducing changes to the back to education scheme and I urge him to reduce further the required qualifying period. The assumption must be removed that people attempting to enter education are motivated by a desire to avoid work. Surely their acquiring new educational and work skills will be cost effective in the long run in providing them with the requirements to attain work and cease being dependent on social welfare.The same thinking should also be applied to support payments for those re-entering employment. The Minister has introduced changes to the one-parent family support and I urge him to extend it. Again, as with the educational grants, this should be examined not as a means whereby people might get something to which they are not entitled, but as a support mechanism to assist them in their transition to full-time work.Much of the difficulty with such supports is that they often apply to people in part-time or low-paying jobs and thus, whatever social welfare benefits are available, they become an essential part of providing people with an adequate income. That reflects not on the State but on employers who pay inadequate wages. Nonetheless, the State can play its part by increasing the minimum wage to the level proposed by the trade union movement. Sinn Féin concurs with that.There is a range of other issues which the social welfare system can help to address, many of which were highlighted in the recent report of the Tallaght west childhood development initiative which showed that high levels of social welfare dependence and all the income factors that involves are coupled with poor inadequate housing and educational deficiencies leading to anti-social behaviour and crime.Right-wing commentators who rail against creating a dependency culture have a point in that no one should have to spend his or her entire life existing on what is barely a subsistence, which is what social welfare is. The way in which to break that dependency is not for the State to drastically cut such provisions, which I accept is far from the Minister's objective, but for the State to target schemes in a way that will allow people to use State benefits as a stepping stone to work, education and community improvement, which will pay dividends in the long term.This is not the sole province of the social welfare system. It will require input from those responsible for housing, policing, education, job creation and so on. It will also require a real commitment on the part of the State, not merely to maintain people on a low level of subsistence, but to pro-actively set about creating a society in which, apart from those who are obviously unable to support themselves without State support, most people are given the opportunity to fulfil themselves through work.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I agree with Deputy Kelleher that the whole issue of where and how child care can be provided has been over-regulated. It will put out of business the motherly neighbour who provides care for one or two families and who is not providing the service from a cash driven point of view. There is an emphasis on making the child care issue a commercial and clinical entity. I am not sure it is heading in the right direction.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which provides for a number of outstanding measures introduced in the 2005 budget, the consequent changes in the social welfare code, which will come into effect in 2005, and the changes to the Pensions Act 1990. The child benefit increases announced in the budget are provided for in the Bill. These were relatively generous increases of between €10 and €12, which must be acknowledged. However, there is a degree of catching up to be done in regard to child benefit if we are to get back into synch with the lofty aims of An Agreed Programme for Government 2002. This programme undertook to complete the Government's programme of multi-annual child benefit increases, which had already fallen into arrears by the 2002 general election. The manifesto also undertook to ensure there would be no returning to the days of minor and occasional increases. However, with increases of €8 and €6 in respect of the 2003 and 2004 budgets, the arrears have continued to mount. This year's increase should have been doubled if we were to get back on track. Child benefit is vital in assisting parents, particularly mothers, with their household budgeting. It is sad to see the slow rate of progress in regard to something as important as child benefit.Improvements in disability benefit is one aspect of the recent budget which could be termed the most disability orientated budget ever in its provision of multi-annual envelopes of additional expenditure. However, the disability movement is underwhelmed by the improvements in the budget. It is virtually unanimous in its view that it is all too little too late. The disability provisions, which confer conditional rights in regard to services, has only served to compound the position. The State can opt out of providing services if it has not got the finance to do so. When money is tight the weakest suffer. Child care and respite hours will be cut back, which is one of the serious drawbacks when money is tight. It is undoubtedly true that the disabled received a raw deal from successive Governments. They have been patronised and discriminated against, and generally thrown a few crumbs. Nowadays the disability movement is much more militant and organised. There is an open revolt because of what it sees as an utterly inadequate and insulting disability Bill. Any Government that fails to defer to the aims and objectives of the disabled will do so at its peril at the polls.I accept the Minister is well disposed to improving the lot of disabled people. I welcome the proposal in section 8 of the Bill to introduce a means-tested payment of up to €35 per week for persons resident in institutions. Prior to this, most residents in institutions were precluded from receiving the disability allowance, and the Minister's recognition of this is to be commended. It will give them a sense of independence. It will also give them a sense of dignity and power to be able to purchase items they might require, which is welcome. There is no doubt that during the peak years of the Celtic tiger economy only a tiny proportion of benefits percolated down to the weakest and most vulnerable people in society. The emphasis on disability in budget 2005 represents the first effort to set this right and to treat disabled persons with equanimity.Improvements in the respite grants scheme are heralded in section 7 of the Bill. The respite care grant is being increased from €845 to €1,000 in respect of each care recipient. Respite care offers the families of children or adults temporary relief, enabling them to recharge their batteries. Respite care gives families a welcome break from the constant physical and mental strain of caring at home on a full-time basis for children or adults with physical or intellectual disability. These people provide an invaluable service to the State and the service should never be threatened. A grave funding crux has arisen in the north east region of the newly established Health Service Executive, which threatens the future of respite care at St. John of God Services, Drumcar, County Louth.In February 2003, after several years of under-funding, there was a tripartite agreement between the Department of Health and Children, the North Eastern Health Board and St. John of God Services. It was agreed that an additional 94 full-time nursing staff would be required to maintain services, including respite services, at the current basic level. Funding for more than 30 nursing staff was provided with no sign of funding for the additional 64 staff who were regarded under the tripartite agreement as being absolutely necessary to maintain the basic level of services. Respite services at St. John of God's, Drumcar, face imminent closure in the next few days unless the Government rescues the services immediately. The closure of this service would be an absolute tragedy. The St. John of God Order has performed heroically. It has dipped into its own budget to the tune of €1.2 million to try to save the respite services. I have no doubt the Minister will agree that this position is unsustainable for the order, which has reached the end of its tether. The problem is that the weakest will suffer. It is the easiest group to target when resources are scarce. The Government's response to this crisis will be a measure of its commitment to the maintenance of respite services.I call for the immediate implementation of the remainder of the 2003 tripartite agreement to maintain the essential services for disabled persons and their carers.

In his new brief he should seize the opportunity to make a real difference. Some people welcomed the moderate increases in social welfare contributions, which was a pleasant change to the tenor of previous budgets. Given the state of our economy, he now has an opportunity to be radical and to use his Ministry for a process of real social change rather than just a continuation of the current system which, as Deputy Ferris said, provides a mere subsistence. It does not encourage, help or support people to grow and develop. I suggest that he should consider introducing the basic income theory, about which the Green Party has been talking for 20 or 25 years. There are various ways in which it could be introduced. The concept is that such an income strategy would free people from social dependency. It would allow people to work part-time rather than policing them to ensure they are not doing certain things. It would liberate people to express themselves through work in a full employment economy. Also, the concept of basic income contains a fundamental truth in that caring work in our society, which is not paid and does not have a monetary income from the marketplace, is valuable and important and should be recognised and valued.The modest increase in the numbers who might apply for carer's allowance — perhaps 2,000 to 2,500 people — is welcome. However, we must consider a broader perspective as to what caring is and where such allowances might apply. An area the Minister could aim to include is that of parenting. A two year old child is helpless and needs care. While Romulus and Remus may have survived with wolves as parents, a young child cannot. The caring work of parents is important and needs to be supported with various types of supports. For example, a young parent on his or her own or a parent with a child with a disability would need particular support, and a parent taking a break from a career structure and perhaps working part-time would also need support. It must be recognised that such roles are caring roles which benefit society and have a value. As we have individualised the tax system, which works and is just and correct, we must also consider the other side of the coin and individualise the social welfare system. We must recognise that those engaged in such caring are doing important work which is valued.This is the Minister's job and his radical task. The Green Party will set out its proposals in the next year or two, certainly before the general election, to highlight a principle it has set out for the 22 years since the foundation of the party, namely, that of a completely different and radical social welfare system. The Green Party will carry out its task. Will the Minister to do the same and bring the necessary measures into effect? Otherwise, we will have to do so when we are in office, hopefully in two and a half years.With regard to the principles governing how that is pursued, we must give parents the choice as to what is right for their children. Different circumstances arise. For example, some will need to return to the education system, some will decide to stay at home as their role and contribution to society, and community care systems will need to be set up for those for whom it is right to work full-time. They should be supported and helped by the State because this type of contribution has built our economy and society, and helped it to develop in the way it has.If we do not recognise this, in a relatively short period of 20 years when another generation comes through, we will pay the cost. While some will tell the Minister we cannot afford to widen the concept of the carer's allowance, I contend that to be radical we must take the long-term view, which is that we cannot afford not to do it. Otherwise, we will end up with a society in which the social capital is spent.We have a well educated, flexible, competent, English-speaking workforce, as well as other attributes such as low tax. Every employer coming to Ireland, such as Yahoo last week, asks why this is so. Part of the reason is our caring society. However, if we follow only the interests and etiquette of the market, we are in danger of losing that asset and its value. The Minister's job is to set up the radical structures that recognise the various caring roles that exist and provide real support for them.

I will bring a view from Tallaght, if I can. I could not hope to be as entertaining as Deputy Eamon Ryan. I note his panic in regard to the next general election. The election is approximately 800 days away and his prospective coalition partners will not even talk to him about it. I do not know why he should panic at this stage but perhaps that is the nature of politics.I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Brennan. Whatever other colleagues may say, he has always done a tremendous job in Government. Moreover, in his role at the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the past 141 days, he has shown a desire to work with and listen to colleagues. His pronouncements in recent days show that the Minister has an open mind and open heart in regard to the issues of concern. His response and reactions are indicative of his attitude. I do not say this only because we share a constituency boundary but because I am a long-time supporter of the Minister and what he is trying to achieve.I am never afraid to refer to my constituency, Dublin South-West-——

Tallaght is fortunate to have tremendous social welfare services and probably the finest social welfare office in the country. If anyone wishes to challenge this, I am prepared to visit offices in his or her area. A tremendous job is being done in Tallaght and its services are first class. I am always happy to record my appreciation of the Department's efforts and staff in that regard. As a Fianna Fáil backbencher, I am happy to acknowledge that the pressure on social welfare services has decreased in recent years because of the great progress made in Tallaght in regard to employment. However, we must continue to press for improvement.I would not state that every measure in the Bill is correct, although I am glad it deals in a positive way with the issues of child benefit, carer's benefit, the respite care grant scheme and the disability allowance. As a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and secretary of the Fianna Fáil policy group on social and family affairs, I was never afraid to say to the Minister and previous Ministers that we must continue to consider these schemes in a caring way, as we do.I support the points of other speakers in regard to care schemes. When my elderly father was ill for some time, my sister carried on that role and I saw what she did. In my constituency work, I meet many people who make a similar case to me. I am glad the Minister has an open mind on helping carers, which I know he will continue to have.There is great pressure on the Minister in regard to social welfare benefits and services, as will always be the case. Whether the economy is good or bad, we must always look after those in need. I am glad the Minister is considering this area. I am not afraid to say to the Minister that there is much talk in the community in regard to child care issues. The Minister, in his remit as Minister for Social and Family Affairs and his wider remit as a member of the Cabinet, will be aware of the need for us to respond in that regard. I hope he will continue to give this issue the attention it requires.Other issues are related to his Department, including travel passes, an issue I have raised during Dáil and committee business. The Minister knows I have an interest in this area. While my constituency has a very young population, it has an ageing population. Many elderly residents tell me of their need for all-Ireland travel passes, which is an issue close to the Minister's heart. An issue also arises when elderly people travel to other jurisdictions, particularly the UK. They look with envy on the system there. Consideration should be given in this regard.While I do not want to confuse the agenda by raising too many issues with the Minister, as I go about my business in my constituency I hear discussion of free benefits for the elderly, including free television licences. This is welcome but some ask whether they can be helped with the exorbitant costs charged by television provision companies. I do not want to give NTL any more grief than I need to, although I am never afraid to do so. I do not want to go home tonight and find that Sky Television is knocked off. However, the Minister should understand that an issue is involved and that people talk about it.I will talk about the issues raised in recent days regarding lone parents and single parent families. The Minister is on the right track in his approach. People come to my weekly advice clinics with all sorts of problems, principally regarding housing and social welfare. In my 15 years as a public representative and particularly since I became a Dáil Deputy, I have received many social welfare queries. Many young single parents plead with me with regard to how their benefits are dealt with, and the restrictions on them, when they wish to return to work or education. That is an issue in my constituency and probably in all others. There are people in this situation who want to better themselves, get back to work or consider further education. They find that the system is restrictive. If they try to move on and better themselves they are faced with changes in their benefits. This is a particular difficulty for people who have moved out of the family home and are in rented accommodation, drawing rent subsidies and so on.It is not easy to deal with this issue and in fairness to the Minister, he has been quite brave in his recent statements. I applaud his efforts to understand and appreciate the issue, which I know he does. He told us in the Dáil debate, to which I listened carefully, that he has visited other jurisdictions, talked to other Ministers and looked at these issues. They will not be easy to deal with but solutions must be found. We should help people to move on, to better themselves and create a better family atmosphere for themselves. The Minister is on the right track and he will get great support in communities across the country if he pursues these issues and bravely grasps the nettles. In recent days, people have told me they are impressed with how the Minister is making his announcements. They have asked that those families who have already made decisions on handing back their benefits and moving into relationships should not be forgotten or set adrift.Nobody suggests what the Minister is trying to achieve is easy, but he will have strong support in communities across the country if he turns out to be the Minister who finally tackles the problem. I listened to the Minister on the radio recently making the point that he is not merely trying to save resources, which is always a good idea, but he is sincere in attempting to deal with this problem. I wish him well in that regard. I applaud the Minister's efforts regarding this Bill and I support it.
#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I congratulate the Minister on a very good social welfare Bill. It is what we would expect from a caring Galway man.The social welfare budget this year is more than €12 billion, the largest spending allocation of any Department. It means that for every €3 that will be spent by the Government in 2005, €1 will go to social welfare entitlements, benefits and supports. Almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, will benefit from these payments. Two out of every five people in the State receive vital welfare supports in one way or another.I welcome the increase in old age pensions and in all social welfare payments, which have increased considerably. The increase in child benefit from 1 April of €10 per month for the first and second child and an increase of €12 per month for three or more children is very welcome. An estimated 520,000 families with more than a million children will benefit from these increases. In the area of carers, which I feel very strongly about, everyone would like to see the means test abolished. This may be possible in the future. The Minister has done a great deal for carers, especially by increasing the income disregard to €270 for a single person and €540 for a couple. A few years ago, due to a very small income disregard, very few carers qualified. That has now changed. A couple with two children on an income of €30,700 can now qualify for the maximum carer's allowance. Accordingly, many carers can now qualify.I welcome the increase to €1,000 in the respite care grant. This payment will be extended to all carers who provide full-time care and who are not employed for more than ten hours per week or receiving other social welfare benefits. It is estimated that an additional 9,200 full-time carers will receive this respite grant, giving carers some acknowledgment of the great work they are doing. The Oireachtas committee on social and family affairs recommended that widows and widowers who are carers should get half-rate carer's allowance payments on top of their widow's or widower's pension. It felt that widows and widowers who are also carers are getting a bad deal as they do not qualify for carer's allowance because they are not allowed two social welfare payments. I ask the Minister to consider this situation and see what he can do for these carers. It seems unfair, if one has one carer with two children and an income of €30,700 qualifying while next door one could have a widow with two children caring on a widow's pension alone because of not qualifying for the carer's grant.There should be more funding to allow people to be kept in their own homes for as long as possible. Home-based subvention should be paid. This would give people the choice of remaining in their own homes for as long as possible. Currently, subvention is paid only if one enters a nursing home. I have nothing against nursing homes but people should have the choice.I also welcome the capital disregard for the means test. This disregard will be increased from €12,694 to €20,000, an increase of €7,300. This will mean that an old age pensioner with no other income can have capital of €28,000 and qualify for full pension. These figures are doubled in the case of a pensioner couple. This will also mean that pensioners who have SSIA accounts will not be affected either. The whole capital disregard for means test allowance allows people to put aside a sizeable amount of money for their future without affecting their pensions.Though it is not in the Minister's brief, I also welcome the rural social scheme implemented by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. That is a very good scheme that helps farmers on low incomes.Regarding the lone parent allowance, some such parents who go into employment and rise above a certain rate of pay have their allowance cut off completely. This should be done on a sliding scale as it is unfair to cut people off completely when they have just over the income limit allowed.I welcome this social welfare Bill. I always believed a government that looks after its elderly and its less well off people on social welfare is doing a very good job, which would be acknowledged at any election time. I thank the Minister for a job well done.
#DermotFitzpatrickFF	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-party	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-dob	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to the House and I congratulate him on his Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005. It is a clear demonstration of his commitment to addressing the needs of people with disabilities, their carers, children, the elderly, widowed people, the unemployed, lone parents and many others who are disadvantaged, vulnerable or on the margins of society.The Bill continues the Government's substantial year on year increases on social welfare spending, representing an increase of almost 60% in four years and a doubling of the 1997 spend. At more than €12 billion, the budget for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is the largest spending allocation of any Department. It means that for every €3 spent by the Government in 2005, almost €1 will go on social welfare entitlements, benefits and supports. An estimated 970,000 people on average are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments this year. Overall, almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, will benefit. That means that two out of every five people in the State are in one way or another receiving vital welfare supports.Overall, since this Government took office, Ireland has changed dramatically, and the facts speak for themselves. The number of people at work has increased to almost 1.9 million. The rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically, from 10% to 4.3%, the lowest rate in the EU and among the lowest in the world. The number of low paid removed from the tax net has increased, and this year all those on the minimum wage have been taken out. Spending on social welfare has more than doubled, from €5.74 billion in 1997 to an expected €12.25 billion in 2005. Over the past decade, while gross average industrial earnings have increased by 71%, social welfare payments have improved by between 87% and 95% and by even more for larger families. Substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes and services have been implemented. New social welfare benefits such as farm assist, carer's benefit, widowed parent grant and respite care grant have been introduced and enhanced. The social welfare increases of the 2005 budget range from more than 7% to over 10%, while inflation this year is expected to come in at 2.5%.I support the policy of concentrating resources on enhancing the child benefit scheme. Child benefit now accounts for over 66% of child income support, while in 1994 it constituted less than 30%. There are sound reasons for that policy. Child benefit is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. As a near universal payment, child benefit is not taxable, not assessed as means for other secondary benefits and is payable to the primary carer, usually the mother. When account is taken of those aspects of payment, it will be seen that child benefit is a most effective child income support mechanism.I very much welcome the support given to carers who provide a valued and worthwhile service. Everyone in this House and in society generally knows the commitment and sacrifice involved. With more people living longer, carers play a vital role in providing qualify-of-life supports. Another fact also sometimes overlooked is that many of the carers are now becoming old age pensioners themselves. They are caring for very elderly parents; it is not unusual now for people to live into their 90s. They require — and, if in reasonable health, should be entitled to — care at home. I welcome the Government's support in that matter.Regarding old age contributory pensions, I raise the matter of women who had to leave paid insured employment on their marriage. Many of those women now find themselves short of the necessary average yearly contributions to qualify for an old age pension in their own right. Will the Minister examine the situation in which those people find themselves with a view to giving them a pro rata pension commensurate with the stamps that they paid or the social welfare payments that they made when in insured employment?It would be remiss of me not to thank the staff of the Department, who carry out their duties diligently and with great good humour and courtesy, something that I have found throughout my political career.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I am glad to speak on this Bill, which is a little like a curate's egg, having both good and bad parts. There are many good things in it. The changes to the carer's allowance and carer's benefit are very welcome. The removal of the situation where a person is caring for two people but cannot receive the grant in respect of both care recipients is also extremely welcome.There are many good things in this regard but the difficulty is that the benefit is still means-tested. Often carers are older people looking after another older person, for example, their life partner. There can be situations where carers look after people in great need of care and the carers themselves are often those who seem to lose out compared with where they would be if they were not doing that job, which the State could in no way take over. It is a mark of the strong campaign by the groups Caring for Carers and the Carers Association that there have been such changes, and I welcome what the Minister has done in that regard. I hope that it will continue.If the means test situation had been removed, a person caring for someone could be assured of the allowance. The other anomaly, which we see every day, is that people who get one social welfare allowance cannot receive another. That is a major problem that I see all the time. People care for older people at home where, without their help, the people in question would certainly be in institutions.Sometimes we must ask ourselves the stage that we have reached as a society. It seems to me that we are sometimes so bogged down in systems that we may forget what they are really about. Someone involved with people, as anyone in a caring profession would be, must see at first hand the real problems that exist. It is something I believe everyone strives for, namely, to have a system that best suits the needs of the people. Otherwise, what is the point of it? Often the system just seems to take over and decides what allowances or resources will be given to a person, whereas a more needs and rights-based assessment system is what everyone aspires to move towards. As a society, we have neglected people who may not have had the power base or voice they should have had. I refer in particular to those with disabilities or special needs as well as to the older population.Everyone knows that our population is getting older, something that has happened elsewhere in Europe. I suppose that we exported many of our older people who are now in England and elsewhere. They are not drawing down the pensions they would have had they remained in this country. We have got away on the cheap. It is obvious that our pension payout is low by European standards. We should be aware that a debt is owed to our older people at home and abroad. Perhaps that should make us realise that, particularly given the Supreme Court decision yesterday, older people have been treated very badly. We owe them a debt that must be paid.It is time for the Government to take a fresh look on a cross-departmental basis at how we support older people. Much lip-service has been paid to supporting them in the community to stay in their own home, but the translation of resources has meant that people have been unable to do that. As a general practitioner, I am only too well aware of the sad, silent migration of older people to institutions. Anything that we can do to reverse the situation must certainly be done, but that will require changes and a commitment to resources.The sum that will be paid out owing to the Supreme Court decision is between €500 million and €2 billion. That is a great deal of money. If even a fraction had been provided for older people's services, circumstances would be different. The same effort put by the Government parties into ensuring that there is no opportunity for older people to get their just rewards and claim back the money stolen from them should be put into legislation to ensure that they might remain in their own communities. After all, we are all getting older and we will prefer not to leave our areas and, instead, remain in our communities. If we could ensure that the same effort shown by the Government in introducing the Health (Amendment) Bill 2004 were put into rights-based legislation for older people, imagine what a wonderful society we would have. Those are not impossible tasks.On the question of home helps, in the past people had great difficulty getting a sufficient number of home help hours. It would have been a cost effective measure to ensure people had a sufficient number of hours because it would have allowed elderly relatives to remain in their own homes and in the community. There has been a difficulty in that regard, however, and whether that difficulty lies with the health boards or the Department is a moot point. The bottom line is that resources have not been available from Government. Trying to secure an adequate number of home help hours is something I and other public representatives have been engaged in on an ongoing basis, and also the provision of aids and appliances. That is an area on which we have been very remiss in terms of supporting older people in their own communities.A sea change is required in this area and one sure way of achieving that is to ensure we put in place some type of rights based legislation. I call on the Government to address the situation with the same vigour it addressed the problem of trying to prevent the pay-back of the money owed to our older people.People in the community have the facilities and the potential to do much important work but our system appears to favour people who want to make money out of the system. They are profit driven and non-community people. Why do our laws appear to favour those who build profit driven, non-community nursing homes rather than allow communities do that? There is great potential in communities, and awareness of the needs of older people, to engage in such projects on a non-profit making basis. The odds are stacked against communities engaging in projects to support older people in their own communities, and that should change.The same applies to people looking for housing. I meet many people in my clinic who are looking for basic accommodation which is not available to them. If there is even a whisper of houses being allocated in, say, some new development, one spends days meeting people and making representations on behalf of one's constituents. They all have basic but important needs and it is difficult to meet those people and know that no matter what happens, they will not be looked after. Some of them have been on waiting lists for a long time. It is time we examined that problem as a society.There is a difficulty in acquiring land yet land is acquired for various private enterprises and so on. There are many voluntary housing associations available to build houses but there is a difficulty in getting the land. Funds are available under the capital assistance scheme where housing associations can get money but there is much bureaucracy involved in that. Also, the money being allocated is not sufficient to allow the targeted numbers to be reached. There is a major problem in that regard.There are many measures the Government could take. This Bill is a step forward but it is insufficient. Our carers need to be supported. It is a question of being penny wise and pound foolish. The State could not possibly do the job being done by carers. The Minister has gone a long way in the Bill but he could go much further.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I thank all the Deputies who spoke on the Bill. I listened to every contribution and took careful note of the themes, ideas and concerns put forward by Deputies. It was a very constructive debate and I thank each and every Deputy who took the trouble to contribute to it. It was the type of debate I hope we can have on many occasions so that we can steer the policy forward.For the first time this Bill is called the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill. I did that deliberately to highlight the fact that as much as one third of the Bill deals with pensions. It is important that we put the issue of pensions to the fore in so far as we can, and this Bill does that by putting in place the IORPs directive and various regulations in that regard. I thank everyone who worked on the Bill, including my own officials who are here, the Department, the parliamentary counsel and everybody else involved. It takes an army of people to produce legislation as complex and as targeted as this Bill. Our thanks are due to all of them.A number of themes came up over the past two days in our discussions on the Bill. It is important to remind ourselves as a nation — many Deputies used this figure in the past two days — that one third of all Government expenditure now goes on the area of social welfare. That is a substantial commitment by the taxpayer to meet our social obligations, be it to the young, the elderly or those at working age. That comes to €12.2 billion this year and is double the amount available to the State in 1997. This year, €1 billion extra over 2004 will be spent on the area of social welfare. That includes the budget figure and the natural increase in the Estimates figure. We are talking about an extra €1 billion in 2005 over 2004.Deputies should remember also that the €14 weekly increase in the lower rate of welfare this year is the highest increase ever provided and it brings the lowest rate up to €148.80, which is an increase of more than 10%. That represents a very substantial step towards the Government's target of bringing these payments to €150 per week in 2002 terms by 2007. We are determined to meet those targets.Everybody points out that the best road out of poverty is employment and that Ireland has achieved the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, which is a major factor in increasing incomes and removing people from the risk of poverty and social exclusion, and strong economic growth is the best policy instrument to tackle poverty. Having said that, I am a firm believer in targeting the resources we have and targeting the action at those people who are most vulnerable and on the margins. That is what the taxpayer would expect us to do with the funds made available, which are now very substantial and amount to one third of all Government spending.The causes of poverty are many and complex. Deputies will be well aware of the complexity of this area and tackling it is part of a national action plan against poverty, which includes a range of actions on employment, social welfare, education, health, housing, disability, equality and many other areas, including taxation in terms of the so-called working poor. I said many times and I say again that tackling poverty must be done in a co-ordinated way with perhaps up to half a dozen Departments being directly involved. It is incumbent on those Departments, therefore, to work together and to have a joined up strategy under the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion so that we can eradicate poverty from our midst.Child poverty was raised in the debate also. I pointed out that child benefit is the main instrument we use in this regard. It is also worth pointing out that between 2001 and 2005 total increases in child benefit were in the order of 65%, which is significant. Successive Governments have favoured child benefit over child dependant allowance because that form of support for children is neutral as between families in receipt of social welfare payments and those where the parents are in employment. There is no disincentive to employment built into child benefit because it is paid irrespective of whether one is employed or unemployed.In 1994 child benefit represented 29% of the total child income support payments for a four child family receiving a social welfare payment. It now represents 66% of such support payment. It will reach 70% when the final phase of the current child benefit strategy is completed. A person would, therefore, only lose 30% of his or her child income support when he or she moves from a welfare payment to employment or in the case of single parents, when he or she moves into a long-term relationship or a better job. Successive Governments have been of the opinion that it is better to pay child benefit than child dependant allowance.In line with the commitments in Sustaining Progress under the heading child poverty initiative, Deputies will be aware that a study is being carried out by NESC on amalgamating child dependant allowances with the family income supplement. The idea is that FIS and, in certain respects, child benefit would be pulled together to provide a unified supplementary child benefit focused on low income families. This would again be a neutral payment as between families where the parents are in employment and those where they are in receipt of social welfare.The figure of 66,000 has been referred to on numerous occasions during the debate in respect of child poverty. I am working on trying to put in place a unified supplementary scheme which would specifically target those 66,000 or so children — there is some debate about the actual number. One of the ways to do this would almost certainly be to run with the NESC's proposals in this regard in respect of a second tier. I look forward to obtaining the result of the study as soon as possible. If we proceed as outlined, we would be able to channel extra resources to low income families without creating a disincentive to employment. It is not fair to the people involved to have payments which act as a disincentive to employment. Everyone in this House agrees that employment, if available and chosen by a person, offers the best way out of deprivation. It is incumbent, therefore, on the House and the Government not to perpetuate structures that act as a disincentive to employment or to returning to education.I make a commitment to the House — the Minister for Finance has confirmed this — that the child benefit package will be completed in next year's budgetary process. A number of Members pointed out that we have reached 96% of our commitment in this regard. This will be brought up to 100% in the next budget.Much has been said about lone parents. I do not wish to revisit all the points made but it is generally accepted that one of the most effective routes out of poverty for vulnerable people in this category is through paid employment and education. It is incumbent on us to design systems that encourage them to take up employment or enter education. I spoke about that matter in public recently. It is worth reminding lone parents who exceed the upper income limit when applying for one-parent family payment that they may qualify for family income supplement. The latter scheme is designed to provide income support for employees on low earnings who have children. It helps make work pay for such employees.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I am aware the Deputy wishes to ask a range of questions in respect of such disregards and I will deal with them on Committee Stage.It may be of assistance to the Deputy to know that one-parent family payment recipients may also benefit from the budget improvement in the assessment of capital for means purposes. This significantly increases the capital disregard from €12,700 to €20,000. In respect of the disregard of €146 per week, earnings above this limit are assessed at 50% up to a maximum of €293 per week. This depends on whether one is in receipt of the minimum or maximum level of lone parent's allowance. Deputy Penrose is strongly of the view that increasing substantially that disregard is the best way to encourage lone parents to return to employment. We will certainly examine that matter. One must try to strike a balance in order that the Department's funds are targeted. However, Deputy Penrose made an interesting point and I will consider it.A number of other points were made in respect of lone parents and I have taken these on board. I am heartened by the response of the Dáil to the comments I made recently in this regard. A sane, sensible, calm and rational debate is required in respect of this matter. Nobody is threatening the income of lone parents. However, I am seeking to ensure that they have a better quality of life, better choices and more options. We can ill afford to have 60,000 of 80,000 lone parents who might be available for work not availing of the choice to do so, particularly at a time when we are seeking workers to come here from other parts of the world. It is too big a resource to leave untapped, particularly if these people wish to be part of the workforce. It must be a matter of choice but we must remove the obstacles to their entering the workforce.

It will be available in the middle of this year and we will then see how we can use it to move matters forward. I am interested in progressing matters as fast as possible.A number of Deputies referred to the back to education allowance. I changed the qualifying criteria from 15 months to 12 months. I have been asked to decrease it further to nine months and, as previously stated, we will continue to examine that matter. I selected the period of 12 months because it coincides with the definition of long-term unemployment commencing at 12 months. There have been some improvements in this area.Deputy Seán Ryan took me to task over not reversing all the so-called 16 cutbacks. We reversed five or six of them, we amended four or five to a substantial degree and I am continuing to examine the remainder to see what action might be taken. I will complete that process as soon as possible. We made substantial changes in the areas of rent supplement, crèche supplement and diet supplement schemes. For example, an additional €2 million was invested in the diet supplement scheme in the recent budget. However, I have asked the various institutes that are expert in this area to carry out a study on what constitutes a proper or normal healthy diet. It is incumbent on us to try to keep pace with best practice in this area.I signed regulations at the end of January which comprehensively deal with a range of issues relating to the supplementary welfare allowance rent scheme. I have discontinued the six-month rule. I have also set out the circumstances in which rent supplements will be payable to those in rented accommodation who can no longer afford to meet their rents. The six months qualifying period has been removed. It remains incumbent on people, however, to demonstrate that they are in need of rent supplement. A demonstration of the need for housing will be supported.These regulations provide the Health Service Executive with the flexibility to provide rent supplements in cases of exceptional need or circumstance. The provision covers instances such as, for example, domestic violence which Deputies raised with me in an earlier debate. I also remind Members of the respite care grant.I again thank everyone who contributed to the debate. I and my officials have taken careful note of all of the points made and we will do our best to respond to them, in due course.

My view on this Criminal Justice Bill is that the Minister should withdraw it at this stage. Essentially, the Minister has attempted to circumvent the legislative process. He is not doing so because of his speech as Gaeilge, but rather because of his new interpretation of 11 September 2001. The Minister announced in his speech that he has major plans to amend heavily the Bill as initiated. I went through his speech and I found he had nine bullet points that were included in the Bill along with a further 11 bullet points that are currently only in his mind. Yet we are supposed to debate these issues today, despite the fact that they are not included in the Bill. Quite frankly, that is an abuse of the legislative process.

It is farcical to conduct a Second Stage debate in the Dáil on this Bill when the Minister knows full well that the Bill that eventually emerges will, in effect, be a new Bill. I can only debate on what is before the House. I generally support the thrust of the Bill as published. However, I cannot give the Minister a blank cheque on those issues which are only in his mind at the moment. Only half the picture is before us. Apart from the abuse of the legislative process, this represents the fruits of the Minister's poor judgment. When he issued the Bill last July, he pre-empted the findings of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which was published ten days later. That report dealt with one of the issues that the Minister covers in his speech, which is the question of the criminalisation of gang membership.I am in favour of measures which will enable a more effective fight against crime. I have always operated on the basic principle of salus populi supremus est lex. We must protect the safety of the people. In conferring additional and wide-ranging powers, we must ensure at all times that a balance is struck between what is required and what does not unjustifiably encroach on a person’s constitutional rights. In this context, I am referring to some of the major issues that are included in the present part of the Bill before the House.Let us examine the proposal in section 5 which will allow a senior garda to issue a search warrant in "circumstances of urgency". A mechanism to issue without judicial supervision a warrant to search a person's home raises serious questions involving the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. I do not say I am totally opposed to the provision but we must consider carefully what we are doing.Similar questions arise about the taking of bodily samples by force and the extension of periods of detention without a requirement to bring a person before a judicial authority. We must carefully thread our way before we put such powers on the Statute Book. We must first ensure as far as possible that proper safeguards are in place.As a countryman, I turn next to a matter which the Minister as a townie might not fully appreciate. Section 30 deals with the storage of firearms. A major reaction has been prompted in rural areas by the fact that the matter is being addressed in the context of a criminal justice Bill. Someone from within the Pale, like the Minister, may say the reaction is irrational.

I do not for a moment suggest an ordinary, decent, licensed gun holder would in any way countenance the incident to which the Minister refers. I record bluntly that I absolutely condemn it.I suggest strongly that the Minister fails to realise in section 30 that ordinary, decent, licensed gun holders are not the problem. The rise in the incidence of the discharging of firearms revealed by Garda statistics is in no way attributable to licensed gun holders. Such people have a long record of responsibility and they take the storage of their weapons seriously. While I accept the need to set standards for the storage of weapons, we must consider the legislative context. Provisions in this area go back to the 1925 Act, which I agree is in need of major reform. The Minister himself touched on some of these issues in his speech, but there are others, including the storage of tourists' guns. I have seen tourists come to my area with guns in the boots of their cars. While we are providing in a criminal justice Bill for the security of the firearms of decent, law-abiding citizens, we do not seem to have any provision for tourists' guns. This is just one example. There are also the questions of the application procedure and the medical history of an applicant, an issue which arose before the Abbeylara tribunal. I want to see a separate firearms Bill. There is more than adequate reason to provide one to update and reform existing provisions.There are three principal issues arising from the Bill's content. While I see no great problem with section 4, the provisions of which relate to the preservation of crime scenes, perhaps the Minister will explain why it is necessary. What is it about the proposed approach in section 4 that distinguishes it from existing practice? I have no problem apart from a degree of curiosity about why the matter is being dealt with here.As I said, section 5 creates issues we must consider carefully. It permits superintendents and higher ranking officers to issue search warrants in circumstances of urgency. The provision raises three issues. The premises to which search warrants apply are mainly houses and businesses. A person's home enjoys special status under the Constitution on the basis that a person's home is considered his or her castle. Article 45 provides that the dwelling of every person is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law. While I appreciate that we are providing for such law, we have traditionally ensured that where a person's home must be invaded and searched, a warrant must be issued by judicial authority.We must also ask what will constitute circumstances of urgency. It is a crucial question. Historically, judges have shown themselves to be available in emergencies when required. Who will decide when circumstances of urgency may be deemed to have arisen? Will there be an objective view? Nothing is set out in the Bill to prescribe what shall constitute an emergency. Who will come to a judgment on the matter? While he touched on it in his speech, the Minister has not dealt with the Dylan Creaven case and the practical problems which have arisen for gardaí in obtaining warrants due to the restrictive decision of the Supreme Court. If my interpretation is correct, gardaí must approach the District Court judge assigned to the district in which a warrant is being issued. That particular judge may not be available.I would like to see the matter examined in more detail and the question asked whether we should provide for some form of judicial supervision. Perhaps we could involve the 7,000 peace commissioners throughout the country who have worked over the years without recognition or reward. Could we use modern technology to facilitate judicial intervention? Perhaps a requirement could be introduced whereby a superintendent who feels he has to move quickly or as a matter of urgency at 1 a.m. must send an e-mail or fax to a judge which could be followed up in the morning. I have been told by a Garda superintendent that such circumstances can arise. I want to see avenues explored to establish whether we can retain in some fashion judicial supervision of the issue of warrants.The extension of the power of gardaí to detain a person without charge must be finely balanced. The period of detention is being increased from 12 to 24 hours. I am aware from my discussions with gardaí that they feel on occasion they do not have enough time to question individuals. While they have a job to do, we must be mindful that we are interfering with the right of the individual to be at liberty and, in a way, with the presumption of innocence. We must be very careful. A balance must be struck to ensure the circumstances in which people are detained without charge remain limited.The power to obtain by force swabs from parts of the body must also be examined. I was struck by the observations of the Human Rights Commission on the matter. The commission has a job to do and while it leans over backwards to talk about individual rights, it is a necessary body which we are fortunate to have. The commission is in a position to point out that there is another side to the coin and an alternative consideration to the need of those who want to ensure that every possible power is available to track down criminals and bring them to justice.While, in general, the Human Rights Commission urges us to proceed cautiously with regard to these measures, it also clearly indicates that if such measures are necessary, they should be surrounded by major safeguards. That is the main point I take from the commission's observations. It states that gardaí should not proceed with non-intimate bodily samples taken by force unless they can justify it and that it must relate to the seriousness of the circumstances and the degree of the suspect's alleged participation, as well as the age, physical and mental health and background of the person involved. There could be a difference if one was talking about a grandmother as opposed to a young man in his twenties. Taking these two extreme cases into account, different views might arise about the appropriateness of the measures proposed.The Human Rights Commission also suggests safeguards in terms of how such samples should be taken. It raises the question of reasonable privacy and who should and should not be present. This could particularly apply with regard to a child or young person who could be accompanied by a guardian or parent. It also mentions the number of gardaí who should be present and whether it might be useful to record the process on video. It raises the issue of having an interpreter present when dealing with somebody not fully conversant or able to deal with matters as Béarla nó as Gaeilge. We can tease out these issues, but it is no harm to put down markers for matters about which we need to be careful.Returning to the issue of firearms legislation, I will press the Minister with regard to licensed gun-holders here, of which there are approximately 200,000. These generally come from a section of the population who would probably have been referred to as yeoman stock or tenant farmers in old British times. They have a very good record with regard to crime. There are issues in terms of facilities and training and how best to train members of the family. It has been suggested that there should be provision for training facilities so that they would be able to handle their guns properly.If there is a refusal to grant a licence, should the person know the grounds for the refusal? There are problems relating to this, because sometimes the refusal could be based on soft intelligence. It might not be in the best interests of security to make such a disclosure. Not everybody applying for such a licence would fit into the category I described.Should there be a time limit during which the application is considered? Should medical history be a factor? There is also a question regarding proper facilities for storage of guns. There are problems in section 30, which is a bit ambiguous. It refers to "secure accommodation". Are we speaking of a secure house or a secure, properly installed gun safe within the house? The phraseology of section 30 is itself ambiguous.Tourists are not required to safely store their guns. Regarding the question of an appeal, it seems wrong in this day and age that there is no right of appeal if somebody is refused a gun licence. There is a certain inconsistency in the present administration of the system. That is understandable because every superintendent currently operates in isolation.This all leads to my main point regarding the firearms issue and section 30. We should have separate legislation covering the issue in the Bill and all these other issues, some of which were touched on by the Minister in his speech. He should take the issue off the table in his closing speech. On behalf of the Opposition, I spoke to many of these people and am quite prepared to put forward views as to how we should have a modern, reformed up to date firearms Bill to cover these and other related issues.There were bullet points in the Minister's speech relating to his innermost thoughts about what should be added to the Bill. There was a greater number of these than bullet points relating to what is in the Bill. I can only touch on them very briefly, because it is pretty outrageous that we are here in the national Parliament debating a Criminal Justice Bill relating to quite serious issues that may or may not be in the Bill by the time it leaves the House and all we have is a one-liner which constitutes the Minister's thoughts on a particular issue.The first point refers to the Minister considering a provision to deal with participation in organised criminal gangs. At face value, this is something we should consider. We considered it in the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, and it gave rise to much debate. I am not sure what is in the Minister's mind. I am trying to read between the words and thoughts, not the lines. Is he suggesting we should criminalise membership of a criminal gang? The committee considered that issue for quite a long time. It looked at the situation in Canada where there are precedents for such legislation. We also received submissions from various bodies, including the Bar Council, which pointed to a variety of difficulties associated with the matter. The Director of Public Prosecutions set out the technical difficulties with regard to any such offence.Lo and behold, rereading the report I find that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, drew the committee's attention to the difficulties presented by any attempt to outlaw membership a criminal gang. If the Minister has a formula to deal with the issue, despite his reservations at that time, Parliament is entitled to see it in order to debate the matter. I leave the door open. I see a huge problem, in practical terms, of proving what is a gang. It might be a group of people with no formalised rules and with no continuing existence, even if one considers the current Provisional IRA which has been around for a while, since 1969. There are things one can point to with——

It is an unlawful organisation, but it has been around for a while, approximately 36 years, even though it claims a longer heritage. How does one deal with a gang that came together a year or two ago? How would one prove membership of a group with no formal association, no meetings and no minutes?Both I and my colleagues in opposition are quite open to trying to get provisions on the Statute Book to help us in the fight against crime. At the very minimum, when we are debating a Criminal Justice Bill, we need to have a little more than the Minister's thoughts expressed in a one-liner in his speech. The issue needs to be teased out and debated fully before we can give it our approval or propose amendments to improve the legislation. Recently, two Government amendments were tabled on Report Stage of the Proceeds of Crime Bill. In principle, I agreed with both amendments but I had no opportunity of teasing them out. That is not the way to deal with legislation.In the time remaining, I will have to deal with another ten points concerning the Minister's thoughts on what might be included in the Bill. In general, I am prepared to look constructively at a provision to strengthen sentencing for drug trafficking and firearms offences. However, those matters take us into the major issue of mandatory sentencing and its possible interference in judicial independence. It also has practical implications given the possible reluctance of the Judiciary to impose such mandatory sentences.

There can be a downside to them in practical terms. If one looks at their impact in other countries, I do not believe there is any proof available that they have led to a reduction in crime. I am open to discussing the issue but it would require detailed debate, while I only have a one-line remark in the Minister's speech. There is nothing on this matter in the Bill.I would certainly be in favour of introducing an offence of supplying drugs to prisoners if I knew exactly what the Minister had in mind. I strongly proposed electronic tagging but the issues remain as to how it will be done and the safeguards that might be necessary. We need to see the detailed provisions on that subject.The Minister's speech also referred to new provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour but all I know about this proposal is what appeared in the Minister's usual media outlets where he made some references to the possibility of introducing anti-social behaviour orders. We cannot debate such an issue merely on the basis of a single line in the Minister's speech. The question of anti-social behaviour is coming increasingly to the forefront due to such problems in our society.I wish I had much more time to debate these issues. I would like to see exactly what the Minister has in mind as regards this criminal justice legislation but he had not afforded us the opportunity of having a full debate on it.

Some 22 pages in 45 minutes, as Gaeilge, was certainly over and above the call of duty.A Bill that is likely to contain amendments which will be in excess of the substance of the original text is not the way to do business. The Minister has a penchant for introducing a Bill and then producing a range of ancillary and miscellaneous provisions, some of which are related while others are not. In that way, the initial Bill becomes something of a dumping ground for various other provisions that may enter the Minister's mind from time to time while the Bill is before the House.I have considerable problems with this legislation although it contains necessary aspects, such as preserving the scene of the crime. I always thought that provision was part of the relevant legislation but presumably gardaí did not have any right to block roads at crime scenes in the past. We are only regularising this matter now but it is a welcome step. It should have been done long ago.The legislation contains severe measures which will have fundamental and far-reaching implications in many respects, not least in the area of civil liberties.More than ten years after the IRA ceasefire, the Government remains of opinion — so far, the Dáil has agreed with the Government on this matter — that ordinary jury courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order.What used to be special measures to deal with emergencies are now part of our ordinary law. For example, it used be possible to argue that, except in exceptional circumstances authorised by the Offences Against the State Act, gardaí have no power in law to arrest a person for interrogation purposes, that Irish law did not recognise the concept of holding a person for questioning and that the only purpose of an arrest was to ensure the attendance of an accused before a court in answer to a charge.However, a process of gradual statutory encroachment means that arrest, detention and questioning have become routine in the investigation of all but the most minor crimes. The power to question people suspected of serious crimes is not of itself objectionable but what must give rise to caution are the circumstances in which it takes place. Questioning in custody is both secret and compulsory. These two factors go to create an environment in which the suspect can become the subject of oppression and be induced to make a statement. At the time of arrest, the Garda interest changes from one of investigation to one of accusation, and the person in custody becomes the adversary of the Garda Síochána. Custody creates an imbalance between those adversarial parties. Every person who has been exposed to the administration of justice in our criminal courts knows how often confessions made by an accused are introduced as evidence and they are often the sole evidence. Everyone familiar with our criminal courts knows how often the accused will deny the crime and reject his confession and how often such confessions constitute the entirety of the State's case against accused persons.Even leaving to one side the occasions when police have been suspected of subjecting those in their custody to violence, many suspects find detention in police custody so intimidating and overwhelming that statements made in such conditions of confusion and disorientation are often unreliable. This is of concern in the case of the young, the less privileged, the least educated members of society and those least integrated into society. One of the ironies is that hardened criminals are much more used to coping with police custody than innocent, young or poor people and they are much less likely to make self-incriminating statements while in a Garda station than somebody young and disoriented.I will outline a number of examples in this regard. The following passage is in appendix K to the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the Kerry babies case:Ned, Mike, and I left our house at 3.50 a.m. . . . we drove through Tralee, on through Dingle town for about six miles and we stopped at a place where the road runs beside the sea, and Ned who was driving got out and opened the boot of the car and took out the bag containing the baby and threw it into the sea. It was about 5.30 a.m. when Ned threw the bag into the sea. You could see the water from the road where we were parked and when the bag was thrown in, it sank and resurfaced and floated on the water.This dramatic passage was taken from a statement made to the Garda by Kathleen Hayes, the sister of Joanne Hayes but it is a description of a journey she never made and a series of events that never took place. We still do not know why that statement was made.I refer to the attitude of Judge Kevin Lynch to the Garda evidence. He stated: "They are not barefaced lies on the part of the Gardaí . . . but they are an exaggeration over and above the true position, or a gilding of the lily, or wishful thinking elevated to the status of hard fact."A more recent example is the case of Dean Lyons, a young heroin addict from Dublin who was accused of the brutal murder of two patients in Grangegorman in March 1997. Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan were murdered, stabbed and mutilated at their home in the grounds of the psychiatric hospital in my constituency. Four months after the murders, Dean Lyons was living homeless in the north inner city when he was arrested for questioning. He was taken to the Bridewell Garda station where he was at first held in cells and then placed in a video and tape-recording suite.Two detective gardaí began questioning him at 2.27 p.m. Mr. Lyons had been without heroin since the previous day. The transcript of this taped interview shows him to be confused and incoherent. We now know that he suffered from learning difficulties at school, feared authority figures and had a habit of confessing to things he had not done. He readily admitted to every charge put to him during the interview. His mother and father, who were allowed to visit him, said he appeared completely disoriented and was swaying and slurring his words when they met him. He was questioned again after they left. As a result he made another written statement and was then charged with the murders of SylviaShields and Mary Callinan. However, when this statement was made, there was no video or audio-taping.The statement contains a chronologically correct narrative about the murders. It also contains accurate descriptions of the interior of the house and the actions of the murderer inside. The media had not published such detailed information at the time of the murders. It was known only to the murderer and to the gardaí. The written statement is in clear, mostly grammatically correct English. Dean Lyons had left school with partial reading and writing skills and he had a limited vocabulary. On the basis of his confession, he was charged with the murders.Three weeks later, a young married couple, Catherine and Carl Doyle, were stabbed to death at their home in Roscommon. An English-born man, Mark Nash, had been visiting them with his girlfriend, Catherine Doyle's sister. He had lived in north Dublin for the previous two years. Following the Roscommon murders, Mr. Nash took off across the fields towards Galway but was caught by gardaí within 24 hours. He admitted to the Grangegorman murders when arrested but the gardaí did not have a clue what he talking about.It transpired that two men confessed to the same murders, one who could not have committed them and the other who has never been charged. We still do not know what happened or whether the person who confessed to the murders, and who is currently in prison, will ever be charged.The chairman of the Garda Complaints Board, Gordon Holmes, has said that public confidence in the Garda is at, or near, an all time low. While the majority of gardaí were "first class", the public perception is that officers who behave less than honourably are not being adequately investigated and punished. I refer to another voice from the coalface, retired Circuit Court judge, Anthony Murphy, who presided over criminal trials in Cork city and county for many years. He told RTE's "Prime Time": "There have been occasions when the guards have committed perjury in my court". He added he had heard confessions, which were:couched in Templemore phraseology ... I had a simple rule about it. If there was a confession and nothing else, the man [the accused] walked.I do not need to refer the Minister to the abuses identified by the Morris tribunal.The reality is that gardaí will arrest a person because they already believe that person is guilty of committing a crime. They will then question that person in custody to secure a confession that confirms those suspicions and this approach will inevitably impact on the evidence the gardaí may later give in court. The result of this approach, coupled with the political pressure on them to obtain convictions, has sometimes produced miscarriages of justice. Judges will not prevent these miscarriages from happening. That is because no law prohibits interrogation during detention. Interrogation is facilitated by the current rules and it is about to be made even easier.The explanatory memorandum casually describes the legislation as proposing "a number of amendments to the Criminal Justice law, particularly in the area of criminal initiatives which will generally improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the criminal justice system". With this introduction, the Minister proposes the most far-reaching changes in the criminal law in more than 20 years when the principle of detention for the purpose of questioning was first established.The Criminal Justice Act of 1984 provided for increased powers of detention consisting of an initial six hours with provision for a further period of six hours solely for the purpose of questioning. This was a radical departure from the common law position of arrest and subsequent questioning. Detention for the purpose of questioning was perceived at the time as a trawling exercise, which was a major infringement of civil liberties. However, the legislation proposes to double the period of detention to 24 hours, which is the same as that provided under the Offences against the State Act 1939.Last year when we debated the renewal of the Offences Against the State (Amendment ) Act 1998, which granted further powers of detention to the Garda in the wake of the Omagh bombing, it transpired that the vast majority of suspects arrested were held for only 12 hours and virtually everybody was released within 24 hours. A period of detention of seven days was provided for in 1976 but it was abolished in 1997. It is wrong to equate the period of detention of terrorist suspects with that of ordinary suspects and to imbed it in criminal law.Under the Good Friday Agreement, Ireland committed itself to a review with a view to dismantling emergency powers and legislation. The Human Rights Commission has gone to great lengths in its peroration on this proposal to explain why the Minister should think more than twice about the introduction of the Bill. I will not go into the details of it, as the Minister has the report. It is absolutely essential that if we are to go down this road, about which I have great reservations, that video and audio recording would be mandatory for all questioning in Garda stations.The extra detention powers granted to the Garda in the 1984 legislation were to be safeguarded against abuse by the introduction of the new garda complaints measures which were eventually introduced in 1987 and proved such a disaster. That was the quid pro quo.The further quid pro quo at the time was the even more elusive proposal to have video and audio recording of suspects being interviewed while detained in Garda stations. This proposal came about because the activities of the “heavy gang” had brought the Garda Síochána into disrepute in the mid 1970s. A committee was set up under Judge Barra O’Briain in 1977 to establish measures of best practice by the Garda in dealing with and in questioning suspects.In 1979 the O'Briain report recommended that the questioning of suspects in custody should be audio and video recorded, and that the necessary equipment should be installed in Garda stations. Progress in implementing the recommendations has been scandalously slow. A quarter of a century after the report was published the scheme for audio and video recording of Garda interviews exists only on a pilot basis. This must be the longest period of a pilot scheme anywhere in the world.Many Garda stations now have the facilities installed, thanks to the Minister. It is time for firm action, for the termination of the pilot scheme and to make mandatory recording of all interviews an integral part of the provisions of this legislation. I will table amendments on this important matter on Committee Stage. I hope the Minister will be open to them.It must be emphasised that mandatory recording of Garda interviews would be as much a protection for gardaí as for suspects, in terms of the possibility of false complaints. Statistics point to a significant number of frivolous and vexatious complaints.The move in regard to search warrants is a more sinister and more fundamental provision whereby gardaí would be permitted to grant search warrants to themselves. We have seen how perversely the existing Garda complaints mechanism has operated under the principle of allowing the gardaí to investigate complaints of wrongdoing against gardaí, so much so that the Minister considers it is his prize proposal in the new Garda Síochána Bill 2004 to repeal that complaints mechanism and replace it with an independent ombudsman commission to restore public confidence in the authorities' ability to ensure Garda accountability. We are being foolish in the extreme if we reactivate the same discredited approach in this Bill that we are abolishing in its sister Bill. It is only a matter of time before a future Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be back in this House to repeal that provision.A new dispensation in the Bill would allow the Garda to decide to enter and search our homes and property, search us and seize "anything found at that place or anything found in the possession of a person present at that place at the time of the search, that that member reasonably believes to be evidence of or relating to the commission of an arrestable offence". It makes a mockery of the whole concept of a search warrant. A District Court or a justice of the peace are third parties to whom gardaí currently have to argue the case. We should look at other democracies throughout the world, in particular the United States, at the manner in which police officers are questioned on the matter.I have concerns about how we operate the current procedure. It is patently obvious that there are abuses in the way search warrants are issued at present. I do not refer to the Judge Curtin affair, rather I refer to the reply I received on 10 June 2004 to a question to the Garda Commissioner in regard to search warrants. In his reply he stated that for 2002, the Garda Síochána sought approximately 4,145 warrants and approximately 4,132 warrants were granted. That is an incredible 99.7% success rate. The Garda Síochána must have wonderful powers of persuasion if they can persuade so many judges to grant them search warrants. It suggests that the process has pretty much become a formality. It is high time the matter was addressed but the way to address it is not to give the Garda the authority to grant themselves search warrants.The reaction of the HRC to this proposal was quite hostile. It stated that the powers of detention without safeguards and the untrammelled powers of search and arrest were stark reminders of 19th century agrarian legislation. The Lord Lieutenant sought to repress agrarian discontent with the heavy hand of the law and the police. At the same time some appeasement and relief was granted through a Land Act. The present twin-track approach of the Minister with the Criminal Justice Bill and the Garda Síochána Bill is a modern version of the 19th century repression and appeasement approach. No doubt the Minister and his Progressive Democrats Party wistfully hanker after the simple, patriarchal measures of the gentry and the empire. However, we are living in changed times in the 21st century.

It is time we faced up to our status as a free, sovereign, democratic State and stopped behaving as a nation under siege from within and without. It is less, not more repressive legislation we need. It is time to dismantle the extensive scaffold of emergency and unusual powers with which we have tainted our democracy for so long and to put in their place a normal criminal and police code more befitting our modern republic. Such repressive measures would include the provision to have a 24-hour detention period and the proposed unilateral search warrant mechanism.With the development of criminal forensic science, DNA can be used to identify suspects and has been a great asset in the fight against crime. However, one's DNA is also highly personal and it is widely acknowledged that collection and retention of DNA is open to abuse. The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 provides for the collection of DNA samples only in extreme circumstances and with the suspect's consent because of the intimate nature of the collection. The Bill proposes the removal of the existing stringent requirements for the collection of samples. It redefines the mouth and head as non-intimate parts of the body for the collection — forcibly if necessary — of samples and provides for increased penalties for obstructing an officer from taking such samples.Apart from a possible invasion of privacy, the period that the State may retain one's DNA before destroying it has increased from six months to 12 months, notwithstanding the fact that the suspect has neither been charged with nor convicted of any offence.A more limited retention period is required as DNA samples, like fingerprint samples, can be used to falsely incriminate a person by, for example, the placing of a sample at a crime scene. Furthermore, the redefinition of the taking of DNA samples as non-intrusive could lead to invasion of personal body space where the person is reluctant to comply.It is worth noting the Human Rights Commission's view on this matter. It is deeply concerned at the possible abuses inherent in the reclassification of samples and the authorisation of the use of force. Big brother is beginning to crowd the space once more.As is his wont, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a penchant for grafting on amendments and miscellaneous sections to his original legislative offering which tend to become as significant as the original. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 is no exception.Section 29 is an extraordinary provision. It allows a garda only on his or her reasonable and subjective opinion that a person is committing an arrestable public order offence to fine that person on the spot or by post by means of a fixed charge notice. Failure to pay this fine will lead to a 50% increase in the amount of the fine after 28 days. Failure to pay the fine within two months will lead to prosecution and the defendant will be liable to a further fine of €1,500. The Minister has stated that this measure is aimed at public order offences connected with unruly behaviour and binge drinking. However, this type of broad measure has been used in the past to criminalise dissent and to discourage legitimate forms of public protest.Again, it is a radical departure from the norm. Article 34 of the Constitution guarantees that justice will be administered in a court of law. However, this is not a court of law; it is another big brother. If the garda forms the opinion that an offence has been committed, he or she immediately becomes judge, jury and executioner. The suspect has no right to due process as there is no due process. If he or she fails to pay the automatic fine within the specified time, the offence is metamorphosed into a criminal offence attracting a summary conviction and €1,500. This is a catch-22 — a distortion of justice — and it provides enormous scope for abuse.

It is my entitlement to say a few words. The provision in section 29 is a devilishly clever abuse of the system, which will no doubt accumulate great wealth and riches for the Exchequer.One of the more bizarre and unusual of the miscellaneous provisions in the Bill is in section 30, which relates to the secure accommodation of firearms. This is before we even have sight of the extra chunk of amendments which are to be made to the Bill. The section provides that a new requirement for obtaining a firearms certificate is to have available a secure place for the accommodation of the firearm. While this is an eminently suitable provision it is totally misplaced in a Criminal Justice Bill, which I hope the Minister will explain to the House on Committee Stage.All the other conditions for securing a firearms certificate are contained in the Firearms Act 1925. Any right-minded person would amend the Firearms Act, but not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who must be provocative and different. He has incensed the National Association of Regional Game Councils and they are outraged at the proposal to bring them and their sporting activities within the ambit of criminal law. Approximately 200,000 members of these organisations are roaming the countryside.The discharge of firearms with fatal results has been a major feature in criminality in today's Ireland. However, it is illicit weaponry bought on the Internet, as indicated by Superintendent Roche in Blanchardstown——

Weaponry is obtained on the Internet and is imported from the Continent in drug consignments, of which the Minister is well aware. It is also traded by Northern Ireland's more or less redundant paramilitaries from both sides, loyalist and republican, who are also bringing some of their weaponry into this State and becoming involved in illegal activities, about which the Minister knows and articulates his position strongly. There are many dissidents at large.The Minister needs to take urgent measures to put these illegal weapons out of circulation. However, he will not do so by bringing legitimate gun owners, who hold firearms exclusively for sporting purposes, within the domain of this criminal and draconian Bill. Rather, it should be placed within the remit of the Firearms Act 1925 so that the law will not criminalise anyone.The Minister has produced a radical and fundamental Bill. It is one of the most important, along with the Garda Síochána Bill, to have appeared before this House in many decades. I look forward to debating the Bill on Committee Stage. I applaud the Minister's approach to many areas of the Garda Síochána Bill but I will remain critical of many of the measures contained in this Bill unless he is prepared to provide considerable safeguards.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I welcome the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill because it is particularly important in view of the issues of crime and justice in society. I strongly support the urgent need to change provisions in respect of policing and justice issues and to deal with crime and its causes. We must bring improvements to our legislation and I welcome any positive developments to that end. However, this change must also be mixed with common sense and respect for human rights. This is why I have concerns about sections of the Bill.When one considers the words "criminal" and "justice", it is essential we remind ourselves that we are dealing with anti-social behaviour and the drugs crisis as well as the use of firearms and other criminal matters. It is important that we deal with these issues in a professional and objective manner. My concerns about the Bill include, for example, the issue of the period of detention being increased from 12 to 24 hours.I also have major concerns about the use of electronic tagging because I believe it is a step in the wrong direction. People should not be fixed with tags to sit in their house and do nothing about a crime for which they are responsible. Instead, serious community service orders should be imposed to deal with these issues, a view the public broadly supports since it is an effort to repay society for damage done to it. A number of projects of this nature have been initiated in Northern Ireland and elsewhere and have proven effective in dealing with petty crime in particular. There is nothing wrong with people repaying their debt to society and making up for their crimes by helping the community in some way. This work could help a project in the person's own community, whether it involves dealing with disadvantaged pupils or people with disabilities. These are important parts of the justice system which could be made more effective. Furthermore, from a financial point of view, it could also save a great deal of taxpayers' money.When one is dealing with crime and justice issues it is essential that we are constantly vigilant about human rights issues. There is no contradiction in this position. People who raise human rights issues in this society and the broader political world are often dismissed by sections of the media as being soft-left liberals. However, if the core values of human rights are not enshrined in legislation, no favours are being done for the broader society. I appeal to the Government to listen to the voices of those who have a genuine respect for human rights. I do not want to see legislation passed that includes elements which might be associated with a South American right wing junta. Having visited parts of South America, I know how abuses of human rights have occurred and have made the situation in particular countries much worse. I am aware of this from discussions with members of the Red Cross and other international bodies.When one examines the details of the Criminal Justice Bill, one can see that it proposes a number of amendments to the criminal law, particularly in the area of criminal investigations, which will enhance Garda powers in tackling crime. It will generally improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system. The Bill takes into account the recommendations of the expert group appointed to consider changes in the criminal law as recommended in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. Some excellent ideas came from the expert group. I welcome its interest in the whole idea of efficiency and effectiveness, because these are the key words in the legislation. The biggest complaint I receive from constituents on the north side of Dublin is about the efficiency and management of the gardaí. There is much respect for gardaí on the beat and there is much respect on the north side of Dublin for members of the drug squad, for example. Over the past couple of years, millions of euro worth of drugs was confiscated in the Coolock and Dublin North-Central areas of my constituency. I commend the gardaí involved in these activities because they also played a major role in saving lives and getting many firearms off the streets in the north side of Dublin. However, this does not mean we cannot deal with issues. While one should focus on examples of good practice, it is also essential to highlight weak practice and bad management.Section 4(1) of the legislation proposes that where a member of the Garda Síochána is in a public place, or any other place under a power of entry authorised by law or to which or in which he or she was expressly or impliedly invited or permitted to be, he or she may, pending the giving of a direction under subsection (3), take such steps as he or she reasonably considers necessary to preserve any evidence of, or relating to, the commission of the offence. The steps which may be taken are specified in subsection (4). I refer to this section in light of a particular case I was asked to raise with the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am referring to the death of a man in Birr, County Offaly. I will not name the person out of respect for the family. The family is very concerned about the way that case was handled. They feel the job was not carried out professionally. The scene was not preserved properly and they feel there are serious questions regarding the death of this man. The family believes their brother was murdered and this situation must be cleared up. The State pathologist’s report stated that the post mortem examination of the body showed an injury to the back of the head which was bleeding. The injury was a laceration, a skin split due to blunt force trauma. Such an injury can be caused by a blow to the head but it is probably more commonly due to a fall and would be consistent with the head striking a projecting surface, for example, the corner of an item of furniture. The family is convinced that not sufficient research and investigation was carried out in the case. I raise the case because it is proper that victims and families are listened to when people’s deaths are investigated.On the broader issue of crime and justice, we must deal with children who are involved in crime. The reality is that 65,000 children are living in severe poverty. Within that figure, 200 to 300 children living in violent and dysfunctional families are at risk and need our help. We will not do these children any service if we do not try to intervene and do something for them at an early age. I am talking about pre-school age and primary school level, particularly junior infants, senior infants and first class. There must be intervention at an early age, otherwise we will lose these children forever. This is a major issue which is not taken very seriously in the broader criminal justice area. We should listen to people on the ground, particularly primary school teachers, who are sending out the message throughout the different parts of the city and the State that there are children at risk who need our help. This would not just help these children, it would save taxpayers money in the future because many of these children will otherwise end up in Mountjoy.This should be examined. I appeal to the Minister to listen carefully to this message. I also appeal to the Minister for Education and Science to listen to the people who work on the front line dealing with some very sad and difficult cases. There should be some sort of an allowance to retain quality teachers in schools in disadvantaged areas. The biggest complaint I receive from people on the ground is that we are losing many quality people. We should consider rewarding people who are creative and who are committed to the education of children in schools in disadvantaged areas because they have a very valuable role to play in society.Section 23 provides that a member of the Garda Síochána who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person who is not less than 18 years is committing or has committed an offence under section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, that is, disorderly conduct in a public place, may serve on the person personally or by post a fixed charge notice. Section 23 raises the issue of anti-social behaviour. This is a regular complaint at clinics and public advice centres of all public representatives.I welcome the debate on crime and justice. I hope there is a debate on the broader issue and that we will tackle the causes of crime. I hope we will deal with anti-social behaviour, the drugs crisis and the lack of help for children at risk.

I am not convinced that as the divisions in Irish society increase, concerns about the performance of the gardaí increase and as concerns mount regarding the treatment of persons in custody that we should be giving the gardaí additional powers. I am not sure we should use high-tech measures such as electronic tagging because I am not convinced the international research indicates it is a worthwhile move for Ireland. We should ensure instead that the gardaí have sufficient manpower to do the job they are trained to do. I am aware the Minister has made a commitment to increase the number of gardaí. While it is impossible to snap one's fingers and increase the number of gardaí overnight, I had hoped that more resources would have been put into ramping up the amount of recruitment to the Garda so that we can get more gardaí on the streets. We should allow the gardaí to function in the way they would wish. Instead of running from one crime scene to another, they should be given the time to walk the beat, talk with people in the community and engage with the citizens they serve. Instead it appears we are providing a significant increase in the powers of detention and Garda control over those whom they wish to investigate. We are concerned about the increase in detention periods, the right to take body samples without permission, electronic tagging and the requirements on firearms.We are still waiting for the Minister to make a valid case for an increase in the detention period from 12 to 24 hours. Also, the increase of detention periods applies to all arrestable offences, which is too broad. For example, offences such as the destruction of property and rape will have the same detention period. A more focused approach would be better than providing such a broad measure to the Garda Síochána. Increasing the detention period may lead to an abuse of the offender's rights in the context of pressure to sign a statement.We urge the Minister to ensure that a person can have a lawyer with them during questioning. At present, a person has the right to access a lawyer but does not have a right to have a lawyer present during questioning. This significant increase — a doubling — of the detention period puts more psychological pressure on an individual being held in custody. We must ensure somebody is present to assist them in this period.The Bill should include detailed regulations for the taking of samples. Moreover, the Minister should take account of the recommendations of the Human Rights Commission in regard to the Bill. The commission rightly pointed out that this is an invasive procedure which can be used as a means of humiliation. The spectre of Saddam Hussein being examined following capture by American forces in Iraq shows how one can be humiliated by the taking of samples or intimate handling while in custody. Regulations must be in place before we proceed with this broad permission to take samples. Examples from abroad support this. The Human Rights Commission referred to the specific safeguards in place in Australia to protect the rights of the individual while taking body samples.It is interesting to consider international experience of electronic tagging. The evidence suggests that utilising the services of a probation officer is as useful as electronic tagging. The rate of recidivism does not decrease if electronic tagging is used. I worry about the loss of contact with the individual in that tagging is more a futuristic surveillance operation than an engagement with the individual in custody. The lesson in regard to Irish criminality of the past ten years is that we must address the root causes of crime in society and the fact that many of those in custody come from a very small cohort of the population. I am not convinced using high-tech measures to monitor this group while they are out of custody is the way forward. We should first address the reasons for their criminality.A properly resourced probation service would be able to do its job more effectively, particularly in the area of overseeing community service orders. I urge the Minister to take on board the concerns of non-governmental organisations and the advice of the Canadian Government which stated in regard to a report on electronic monitoring that one of its most telling findings was that the recidivism rate for the electronic monitoring of offenders was not different from the rate of probationers after controlling for offender risk. The lack of difference questions the cost-saving value of electronic monitoring.I worry about the diminished human contact with the individual. This will increase——

Introducing electronic tagging at this stage would run the risk of creating greater divisions in society.With regard to the requirements for firearms certificates, I take the point the game councils make, namely, that they are being tarred with the same brush by being sluiced into the Bill. While the Minister may have valid reasons for incorporating this matter into the Bill, I hope he would at least engage in dialogue with the game councils to alleviate their concerns. I assume the Minister is trying to ensure that any firearms in the public domain are kept under lock and key and that children in particular are not put at risk or able to access firearms as easily as they might be at present. If this is the case, I welcome the measure but it would be useful to have some inkling of the further regulations the Minister might introduce in this area. The Minister's legislative record shows that he introduces much detail on Committee Stage and more detail in regulations. It would be no harm to get a flavour of what will come down the line prior to looking for permission from the House to approve it.It is a mixed Bill. It is hard to see through the detail to its inception or to ascertain exactly what knock-on effect the Bill will have. However, I am deeply concerned at giving the Garda Síochána increased powers of detention at a time when the public seek more gardaí on the streets rather than the locking up for longer periods of those taken into custody.

Séard a dhéanann an Bille ná cumhachtaí gabhála an Gharda a leathnú. Cuirtear lena gcumhachtaí samplaí corpach a thógaint gan toil an duine. Leathnaítear na cumhachtaí i dtaobh eisiúint barántais cuardaigh. Níl seo ach céim amháin ó chuardach gan barántas a fhógairt.Níl sa Bhille seo ach ceann eile de sraith reachtaíochta draganta ón bPáirtí Daonlathach ó tháinig a bhaill i réim sa Rialtas seo. Nach ait é go bhfuil an tAire diúltach i leith idirghabháil Stáit in aon ghné eile de shaol pearsanta ach nach bhfuil fadhb ar bith aige cur le cumhachtaí ionraitheach an Stáit trí cur le cumhachtaí an Gharda Síochána go leanúnach. Mar aon lena pholasaithe uilig, ní shíleann sé gur gá dó fianaise ar bith a léiriú go bhfuil gá leis na cumhachtaí breise nó go gcuirfidh siad le héifeacht an fhórsa póilínteacht.

Féach cheana féin an tseachtain seo conas mar a sheas tuairim an Aturnae Ginearálta i leith reachtaíochta ar ardaíodh ceisteanna bunreachtúla faoi. De thairbhe an dabht sin bheith ardaithe, ní amháin gur léirigh an Coimisiún um Chearta an Duine na gnéithe a bhí ag déanamh tinnis dó sa mBille seo ach is léir gur dhiúltaigh sé an Bille ina iomlán.Ach tá an tAire tar éis neamhaird a dhéanamh ar na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh sé. Is léiriú é seo ar mheon an Taoisigh nuair is féidir leis an Aire neamhaird a dhéanamh go leanúnach ar an Choimisiún um Chearta an Duine, gur féidir leis neamhionannais sóisialta a chraobhscaoileadh agus fós go ligtear dó a aireacht agus a chúram a choimeád.Tacaím agus tacaíonn Sinn Féin le beartanna atá crua i gcoinne coiriúlachta, ach tá imní ró-mhór orainn faoi mholtaí an Aire chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don mBille áirithe seo. Mar shampla, i roinn 5(20) den mBille, tugtar cead do Cheannfort an Gharda Síochána barántas cuardaigh a eisiúint as a dheoin féin seachas ar iarratas chuig breitheamh na Cúirte Dúiche. Séard is brí leis seo ná gur féidir le gardaí ionradh ar áitreabh de réir a dtola fad is a thugann an ceannfort cead dóibh. D'éiligh an Choimisiún um Chearta an Duine gur gá an smacht breithiúnach a choimeád ar eisiúint barántais cuardaigh mar gur cur isteach suntasach é seo ar cheart do shaol priobháideach atá cosanta ag Alt 40.5 den Bhunreacht 1937 agus cosanta ag dlíthe ceartanna daonna idirnáisiúnta, ina measc Alt 8 agus Alt 1 de Phrotocól 1 den Choinbhinsean Eorpach ar Chearta Daonna agus Alt 17 den International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Cheistigh an coimisiún chomh maith an raibh gá leis na forálacha atá molta ag an Aire mar go bhfuil cheana féin fáil ar bhreithimh na Cúirte Dúiche de lá is d'oíche chun déileáil le hiarratais chun barántais cuardaigh a mheas. Deir an Coimisiún um Chearta an Duine nach bhfuil an cás déanta ag an Rialtas agus measaim féin nach bhfuil sé déanta ag an Aire sa gcás seo.Ligeann roinn 8 leathnú ar an am coinneála suas go 24 uair a chloig chun iad siúd atá faoi ghlas a cheistiú faoi ghnáth coireanna. Arís, tugann an Coimisiún um Chearta an Duine an argóint go mbeidh an Stát ag cloí ar a dhualgais faoin Choinbhinsean Eorpach ar Chearta Daonna agus an ICCPR leis an moladh seo. Cuireann Alt 40.4 den Bhunreacht, Alt 5 de Coinbhinsean Eorpach ar Chearta Daonna agus Alt 9 de ICCPR iachall ar an Stát siúd atá gafa ar aon chúis coiriúil a thógaint os comhair udarás breithiúnach gan mhoill. Tá an coimisiún faoin dtuairim gur leor an tréimhse 12 uair a chloig faoi choinneál atá ann faoi láthair ar mhaithe le fiosrúchán ceart agus comhair, agus nach bhfuil an cás leagtha amach ag an Aire cén fáth gur gá an chumhacht seo a leathnú.Faoi roinn 13 ligfear samplaí corpartha áirithe — swab béil agus eile — a thógaint gan chead agus ligfear do na húdaráis na samplaí sin a choimeád go ceann bliana fiú muna bhfuil an duine cúisithe as aon choir. D'ardaigh an coimisiún roinnt gnéithe atá ag déanamh buairt dó faoin moladh seo. Dá réir, níl go leor cosaintí ann agus mar atá sé dreachtaithe faoi láthair ní dhéanann an Bille seo coimheá idir leas an phobail ó thaobh faisnéise a fháil agus idir cheart an duine le meas ar a iomláine fisiciúil agus a shaol priobháideach agus go bhfuil tar éis teipe go hiomlán ar an Aire a chruthú go bhfuil sé riachtanach no cionmhar chun coireanna a chosc.Cé go ligeann an reachtaíocht seo don Aire rialacha a leagann amach i leith tógaint samplaí corpartha ar an mbonn atá molta ag an choimisiún, bheadh sé níos fearr dá mbeadh a leithéid de chosaint scríofa sa bhun reachtaíocht agus nach mbeadh sé fágtha ar dhiscréid an Aire nó athrú Airí gan maoirseacht reachtúil.Tógaim an deis seo chun glacadh leis agus failtiú roimh na buntáistí móra d'fhiosrúchán agus cúisiú coireanna a fhéadfaidh theacht as DNA. Aontaím leis an Chomhairle Éireannach do Chearta Sibhialta, an ICCL, gur gá d'aon chóras atá ag bailiú eolais DNA le choimeád bheith riaraithe le caighdeán cosanta priobháideachas docht agus gur gá chinntiú nach ndéanfaidh aon inference a ghlacadh faoi chiontacht nó nach dtagann sé salach ar an cheart do triail chóir an duine agus go mbeidh seo leagtha amach igceart.Aontaím chomh maith gur cóir go mbeadh fáil ar an bhunachar seo má tá sé ann ar mhaithe le cruthú nach bhfuil aon duine ciontach chomh maith le daoine a bheith ciontach agus go mbeadh cóir soiléir leagtha amach i leith siúd a úsáideann a leithéid de bhunachar d'aon ghníomh seachas d'fhiosrúchán coiriúil. Molaim don Aire agus Teachtaí eile an Tí seo díriú ar an tuairisc speisialta an ICCL ar an cheist seo. D'fhoilsigh sé "The Human Rights Compatibility of the Establishment of a DNA Database" i mí Dheireadh Fomhair 2003 agus tá roinnt céisteanna móra spéisiúla ansin.Maidir leis an cheist faoi ligint de ráitéisí a dhéanamh roimh chás cúirte agus atá salach ar ráitéisí ina dhiadh sin mar chuid den fianaise, mar a ligfear faoi fhoralácha Chuid 3 go bhfuil roinnt fadhbanna anseo. Seo gné a dhírigh an Comhchoiste um Dhlí agus Ceart, Comhionannas, Cosaint agus Cearta Bán sa Teach seo isteach uirthi agus phlé sé go dian í. Chaith an coiste a lán ama ag cíoradh na ceiste seo agus tar éis teip chás dunmharú i Luimneach. Is trua gur léiriú seo ar sotal an Aire gur fhoilsigh sé an Bille seo sula raibh muid críochnaithe sa choiste sin ag plé sin agus nár fhan sé ar mholtaí an choiste — fiú nuair a bhí a lán Teachtaí Rialtais gafa leis an díospóireacht sin.Tá imní mhór ar Choimisiún um Chearta an Duine agus an ICCL. Dúirt siad nach bhfuil na cumhachtaí atá acu úsáidaithe ina n-iomlán ag na gardaí agus ag an chóras dhlí agus gur theip an tAire a léiriú go bhfuil fadhb suntasach, dáiríre agus leanúnach ann agus gur gá an dlí a athrú sula dhéanfar na bunchéimeanna eile maidir le cosaint bhreise finnéithe a thógáil ar dtús. Rinneadh a leithéid de moltaí ag an choiste anuraidh agus is trua nár tógadh na céimeanna sin sular thosaigh muid ag athrú an dlí.Níl gá ann le níos mó cumhachtaí do na gardaí. Is é atá uainn na dáileadh níos éifeachtaí agus níos straitéisí ar na hacmhainní atá ag na gardaí faoi láthair mar aon le leasú ar an Gharda Síochána chun a chinntiú go mbeadh an fórsa níos freagraí do cheantair agus na daoine ina bhfuil sé ina measc. Tá roinnt de sin sa mBille Garda Síochána agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé níos freagraí i ndiaidh leasuithe agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire sásta leasuithe a ghlacadh ag Céim an Choiste agus gur féidir linn an Bille a fheabhsú. Faoí láthair ní thugaim tacaíocht dó.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The Minister made the point that for a lot of the time, this is about striking a balance to ensure fairness to the suspect but also to ensure that this does not go overly in favour of the accused. That is a common debate which takes place and we are always concerned to strike the right balance, which is delicate.I will comment on Part 3 of the Bill but, in passing, I am glad to see that the Garda Síochána Bill is taking shape in the context of full consultation. Many elements of the Bill have attracted a lot of support from the Opposition and on that basis, the powers conferred by Part 2 of the Bill are timely. I would not be concerned about them and would be pleased to see the powers of the Ombudsman commission going hand in hand with increased powers for the Garda.However, Part 3 gives me some cause for concern. The Minister makes the point that this comes from a Canadian Supreme Court decision and as such is part of Canadian common law. It makes me wonder why it is never before the Irish Supreme Court or why, for example, a similar case was not taken after the Keane trial, perhaps by the DPP, to see if there were a possibility that the Supreme Court might admit pre-trial statements. It is worth making that distinction. We are putting it into law by statute, and it is always welcome that the Legislature takes the bull by the horns rather than waiting for the Judiciary to do its job for it. However, the question must be asked why it has never come through the Irish common law system. That is the basis of my concerns. The Irish courts, while identifying what Mr. Justice Carney lamented as collective amnesia, have never seen the need to make such amendments.The legislation came about as a result of the collapse of that trial. That happened on 30 October 2003, and it concerns me that the Minister declared that he would introduce this legislation only four days later. Given that the rules of evidence have developed over a century, that we should decide after four days' deliberation to turn some basic rules on their head is worrying. In 1980, the Law Reform Commission conducted a detailed analysis of the area and recommended extremely strongly against the types of reforms considered here. There is a danger of changing law quickly in reaction to public disquiet for political reasons. It is not good to be patriarchal and tell people what is best for them. At the same time, one must also caution against laws that are dreamt up or decided within such a short time of a public outcry or the identification of a problem. We can see that in the health legislation passed by the Dáil before Christmas. When one is too quick in one's response, one can cause problems.I will give an example of what I see as a problem in these provisions. If someone makes a statement in a Garda station and then goes to court and resiles from it or says nothing — there are certain categories where that can happen — it gives a witness an opportunity to stitch up a defendant. There is a possibility of a double bluff. We are trying to deal with people who are ruthless and prepared to intimidate witnesses. Equally, I would imagine that if I wanted to stitch up an accused, I could make a statement in the Garda station knowing that I would not be cross-examined on it. I would then go to court and resile from it or say nothing whatsoever on it. There is a very strong chance under the new legislation that the trial judge would admit that statement and that the witness would know that he or she would not be cross-examined. That is a very serious concern, and I hope that the Minister will address it.I know that there is a whole raft of safety measures to ensure that the statement is reliable and given under oath. Fundamentally, however, the accused is not there, and there is no cross-examination. There is a whole new category of evidence being introduced into Irish trials that we have not had before, and we should not take such a step lightly. Nothing much has changed. Criminals have not become more ruthless. The gardaí are not less able to protect witnesses. For example, the Criminal Justice Act 1999 allowed evidence to be given by deposition, on oath, in the presence of the accused or by television link. Stronger sentencing powers were granted to courts regarding offences of intimidation. We have seen improvements in the court system and how the Courts Service conducts trials. We have seen improvements in bringing the High Court to Limerick in the case of the problems there to avoid intimidation.Those changes must be bedded down. We must see if there is another example of the problems that emerged at the Keane trial. We should not change our law of evidence and the basic rule against hearsay on the basis of one case. Would the statements from which witnesses in the Keane trial resiled be admissible under this legislation if that trial were held after this legislation becomes law? I am not sure since most of the statements from which people shrank back were caution statements and not under oath. I am not a criminal lawyer and am not sure whether there may be a distinction between the two. However, the new legislation requires that the evidence must have been given under oath. As far as I know, the Keane trial statements were caution statements and therefore would not have qualified for admittance. That must be examined.We must also consider the danger of evidence given in the Garda station or, as the Minister said in his speech, statements given to the Revenue Commissioners. Very often people have axes to grind. We are talking about the heat of the moment, and people sometimes want to change their minds about that sort of evidence because whatever grievance they had at the time of giving evidence has disappeared. They go into court and make what they say is a true and honest statement, but that can be overlooked by the trial judge. That is also dangerous, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider that and decide whether it is appropriate.The basic common law system in Ireland, where a witness turns hostile, allows counsel to bring him or her back to the proof. Alternatively, counsel can attempt to discredit the witness by cross-examination, pointing to his or her inconsistencies. Ultimately, however, that evidence is no longer acceptable. The pre-trial witness statements are never admitted. Cross-examination is the great power of our adversarial system. It has been relied on by the criminal justice system for centuries, and I see serious danger in permitting this legislation on to the Statute Book. The rule against hearsay prevents the situation where one is at one remove from a court, in a Garda station, and not in the presence of the accused. If the Criminal Justice Act 1999 required the presence of an accused and a sworn statement, those requirements should also be here. We do not have such a major problem that it requires draconian measures at this stage.We should take great care in deciding whether this change is appropriate for the reasons that I have pointed out. A much longer gestation period should be allowed before we commit ourselves to making fundamental changes to the rules of evidence. The Minister might have considered submitting this proposal to the Law Reform Commission for its consideration; that is the more common route. I am not sure what the attitude of the Human Rights Commission is to all this, how it fits in with the principles of natural justice and audi alterem partem, whereby one is entitled to have one’s statement cross-examined, or whether it is constitutional. These are concerns I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to consider.

Accordingly, I was very pleased when the documentation was completed, allowing the next stage of the procurement process to get under way.The project is being managed by the Office of Public Works under the direction of a steering group chaired by my Department and is being conducted with full regard to, and in accordance with, EU and national procurement rules and regulations, including the Department of Finance's interim guidelines for the provision of infrastructure and capital investments through public private partnerships. While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of the procurement process under way, I am informed that the NCC project team, headed by the Office of Public Works, is currently engaged in a process of consultation with the tenderers, intended, inter alia, to enable the OPW to provide clarification to and, where appropriate, to take account of issues raised by, tenderers, thereby helping to ensure the quality and robustness of the tenders to be submitted.Allowing sufficient time for engagement with the tenderers, it is hoped that a provisional preferred tenderer will be selected by mid-year, with the award of the contract, subject to Government approval, following later.The provision of a national conference centre is a necessary precursor to expanding a business tourism sector currently worth €250 million a year to the country. As such, it remains my personal priority, and that of the Government, to have this project brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible date.

I stated also, and the Minister referred to it, that international business tourism is now worth approximately €40 billion and this country gets approximately 1% of that business. Approximately 4,000 conferences take place throughout Europe, only 1% of which are held here. I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to speed up this process.As regards the bidders, will the Minister confirm that one of the bidders withdrew from the competition and that at this stage there are only two tenderers?

On a related issue, business tourists who visit other countries in Europe can reclaim VAT. As we will shortly debate the Finance Bill, I ask the Minister to make personal representations to the Minister for Finance to allow business tourists who come here for conferences and so on reclaim VAT. These two issues are connected — a conference centre and the reclaiming of VAT by business tourists to encourage more business tourism in the country.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	210	International film production is now very big business. A Review of Film Production in Ireland, published recently by the audiovisual federation of IBEC, shows that in 2003, total funding for 179 productions in Ireland, comprising feature films and major TV dramas, independent TV production and animation, came to €320.2 million. The United States was the largest source of non-Irish funding contributing €145.8 million, or 46% of total funding.During my recent visit to the United States, I visited all the major studios and made the case for Ireland as a location for film-making. I am aware that there are competitive pressures coming to bear on the effort to attract international film productions, particularly from economies where wage rates and other costs are far lower than in Ireland. However, we also have advantages, such as our use of the English language, our historical links, particularly with the United States, the very high skill and experience levels of our film professionals, our relatively low level of bureaucracy and the variety of locations available within quite short distances of one another. The Government has done its part in that film producers now have certainty as the section 481 scheme has been extended to 2008, with the amount that can be raised increasing substantially from €10.48 million to €15 million with effect from 1 January 2005.In short, I believe we have a great deal to offer to international producers, but it is critical that this is effectively communicated, that personal and organisational relationships are developed that will allow us to best understand how international producers make decisions on location and that we respond most effectively to their needs. Our strengths may not always be immediately evident to someone looking at Ireland from outside as a possible location, but these strengths are very significant and must be properly explained. It is for that reason I suggested, when I was in the US, that it would be useful to appoint a person who would be based in Los Angeles, at the centre of global film production, to make sure that the case for Ireland is made in the best possible way.I have asked my officials to explore this in conjunction with the Irish Film Board, following which I will determine how best to take this initiative forward.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I welcome the first visit of the Minister to America. I have asked questions about this matter on a number of occasions in the House, and it was a positive move to make. The appointment of a film ambassador would further underpin the value of our film industry. To whom would an ambassador be responsible? Would it be to the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board or, acting on the Minister's behalf, the Department? What infrastructure would be put in place to support the ambassador and what would be the status of the person appointed? Would it be a principal officer or a consul similar to those who represent us in other countries?Will we see that type of appointment in respect of the film industry? Will the person appointed be an Irish person who is well known in the film industry and obviously has connections? Is that the person the Minister is considering or will a civil servant get the position? Obviously, this person will liaise with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland on the overall context of attracting particular films to Ireland, but I would like to know the infrastructure that will be put in place and the status of the person who will be appointed.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	212	When I was in the United States it was indicated to me by people in charge of major production studios that the absence of a person on the ground in Hollywood was a negative factor in terms of bringing film to Ireland. The major studios like to have somebody whom they can contact relatively quickly. They indicated to me that when locations outside the United States are considered, Ireland is one of six locations which is always given some consideration. They also indicated that it would be beneficial for Ireland to have somebody on the ground dealing with Ireland's cause in so far as attracting films is concerned. It was in that context I put forward the proposal that we should appoint a person who would be based in Los Angeles to assist the Irish Film Board in its work and to attract films to Ireland. Accordingly, I have asked the board and my officials to consider this matter.We already have a very good commissioner of film, working within the Irish Film Board, whose job it is to attract inward productions. I envisage that he would liaise with the person who may be appointed to the post in the United States of America. The latter will be employed on a contract or agency basis. This has been done quite successfully in other jurisdictions. The person need not necessarily be employed on a full-time basis. One could describe the person concerned, in the loosest possible way and using the generic term, as an ambassador. Ireland is already represented in diplomatic circles by the ambassador to the US and also by a consul general and, in Los Angeles, an honorary consul general. I envisage that the person appointed will liaise with these diplomats in terms of attracting inward production.We had a successful visit to the United States of America. As Members are aware, we announced during the trip that the film "Lassie" is to begin shooting in Ireland in April. In addition, I received positive indications from at least four major studies of the probability of further film production taking place here. There was a recognition of the advantages Ireland has to offer, namely, that is an English-speaking country; that our topography and seascapes are quite magnificent; that we have professional crews; that we have large number of excellent professional actors and actresses; and that there is certainty about film relief here until the end of 2008 and that the cap attaching thereto has been increased to €15 million. The latter will not change until the end of 2008 at the earliest. If it does change in the meantime, it will only do so for the better.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	213	As I have previously informed the House, I was authorised by Government to invite expressions of interest, by way of public invitation, from the private sector in participating on the basis of a public private partnership in the capital redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre in or around the vicinity of the site of the existing theatre. The accommodation brief for the new theatre specified the following requirements: to be a signature development representative of a national theatre in the 21st century; to be in an appropriate civic setting and form part of the overall urban regeneration represented by the O'Connell Street integrated area plan and the north-east inner city plan; three significant enlarged auditoria, the Abbey, the Peacock and a third multi-purpose space; a dedicated education and outreach facility; a publicly accessible archive; a restaurant-bar; improved public areas; disabled access for audiences and artists; and best practice theatre production facilities.My preference would have been to redevelop the theatre at its current location. However, taking into consideration the requirements I have outlined, when it became apparent that excessive and costly additions to the existing footprint would be necessary to render the existing location suitable, I arranged for a trawl of other available city centre locations. As the Deputy will appreciate, suitable locations are in short supply. For a period it seemed a suitable site might be available at the former Carlton cinema in O'Connell Street, but it later emerged that this site was and continues to be caught up in legal complexities.Last year a site was identified at Coláiste Mhuire on Parnell Square which it appeared might, along with an adjacent building, have provided the necessary footprint to meet the accommodation requirements of the redeveloped Abbey Theatre. Unfortunately, the owner of the adjacent premises was not prepared to sell them to the State for what my advisers considered a fair market price. In the circumstances, there was no option but to withdraw from the negotiations. The Office of Public Works has recently confirmed that the Coláiste Mhuire site on its own is too small.I regret that our efforts to secure and announce a new location for the Abbey Theatre during the centenary year were ultimately unsuccessful. I assure the Deputy of my unrelenting efforts to identify a suitable location and I am in constant contact with the Office of Public Works to that end. I remain confident that a suitable site will be identified and acquired in due course.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	214	It seems strange that on 1 December the Minister indicated that the OPW had recommended a site and that he was going to put this site forward to Cabinet and did not, as a result, want to announce details about it. Surely the OPW would have reached agreement on a price with all property owners at the location, Coláiste Mhuire, before that recommendation was made. What went wrong? Was agreement not reached before the Minister's announcement or did the OPW only make its offer to the property owners following that announcement?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	215	When I stated that we hoped to identify and announce a site in the centenary year, I was confident that the Parnell Square site would be acquired in its entirety by the Office of Public Works. The OPW was also confident in this regard. However, as the Deputy is aware, the OPW was unable to acquire the site at what it regarded as a fair price. The owners of a portion of the site, 1 Granby Row, which we failed to acquire, indicated to the Office of Public Works that they required substantially more in the way of money. The OPW was satisfied that the amount being sought was considerably more than the market value and entirely unreasonable. In those circumstances, we withdrew from the negotiations.Nobody should be under the illusion that it is possible, just because the State is involved in a bidding process, to extract more than a property is worth. We are obliged to safeguard taxpayers' money and that is precisely what we did in this instance. That does not mean that we will not be in a position to site the Abbey Theatre elsewhere. However, I will not waste taxpayers' money.

In light of the motion passed by Dublin City Council regarding the Carlton Cinema site, is that site back on the agenda for consideration? Are other sites being considered at present? I read a newspaper report in which it was stated that the GPO might be a possible site. Will the Minister confirm that all sites are up for consideration again? Will he confirm that the Coláiste Mhuire site has been eliminated? Are the Carlton Cinema site and other sites up for consideration?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Coláiste Mhuire is in public ownership. The difficulty is that this is not the position in respect of 1 Granby Row. If the latter were to come back into the equation at market value, we would reconsider it. However, this appears to be unlikely.The Carlton site on O'Connell Street is, prima facie, ideal for a new theatre. The difficulty is, however, that there are legal difficulties attaching to the site and it does not appear that it will become available in the short to medium term.The current Abbey Theatre site requires a major extension of the footprint. It appears that time and cost would make that option less than desirable and it may, in fact, be completely unviable. The Hawkins House option remains in play and a number of other options are also available.The Parnell Square site, without 1 Granby Row, does not meet the accommodation brief. Since this is the case, it could not be considered unless 1 Granby Row came back into play. I asked the Office of Public Works to reconsider the situation and I am awaiting a further report from it. Due to the commercial sensitivities involved, Deputy Deenihan will understand why I do not want to go into detail in respect of which sites might be suitable.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Achieving as wide as possible a distribution of visitor numbers across the different regions with an associated spread of tourism revenue, has long been recognised as a major objective and challenge for tourism policy. In more recent times there has been an increasing international trend towards shorter more frequent breaks, which clearly favours easily accessible urban destinations. That has driven, to a significant extent, the more recent growth in Dublin and the eastern region. At a time of overall national tourism growth, I am concerned that the issue of regional spread should be pro-actively and energetically addressed and in that context I am pleased that the programmes and initiatives operated by the State tourism agencies and the action plan set out in the report of the tourism policy review group fully reflect this objective.In their plans for 2005, both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland will roll out a number of innovative approaches which should heighten the regional impact of Ireland's marketing activities both nationally and overseas. All regions will feature prominently in the full range of marketing activities; a dedicated marketing fund for tactical co-operative initiatives with the regional tourism authorities and their members will be established for 2005; a region to region approach will be adopted in Britain which will capitalise on direct access links to the regions; specific campaigns promoting the western seaboard will be mounted in North America; a sponsor a region approach will be adopted in Europe whereby each market office will focus attention alternately on a particular Irish region in order to enhance the awareness of the local trade of what that region has to offer; an enhanced consumer website with increased functionality and a strong regional input will provide for more dynamic up to the minute packages to entice the domestic traveller; and a strong focus on event-based holidays will be complemented by a more streamlined and targeted festivals and cultural events fund which will continue to favour the lesser-developed regions.While many of the actions proposed by the tourism policy review group will have a positive impact on the regional distribution of tourism numbers and revenue, key actions I would highlight include those relating to product development, tourism promotion, access transport and the appropriate infrastructure and arrangements for the delivery of tourism policy at regional level.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseA major impediment to growth for certain regions, particularly the western seaboard and the north west, and from certain key source markets, particularly the US, has been the lack of good quality direct access. Recent developments, in particular the decision by Ryanair as regards its plans to develop Shannon Airport as a European hub, the announcement by American Airlines on new services from Boston and Chicago and the plans of Continental Airlines for a new direct service to Belfast, provide a welcome boost to the regions as we move into 2005. These developments build on the significant expansion by Aer Lingus of its route network since 2001. Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland, which have been active in their pursuit of access improvements, will help to promote these routes in order to optimise their inbound tourism potential.As the House will be aware, I have no direct responsibility as regards individual actions or measures relating to tourism promotion or development in so far as specific areas of the country are concerned. These are, of course, a day-to-day function of the tourism agencies.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	219	This is obviously a serious matter for the rest of the country, apart from Dublin. The short-based holiday package now seems to be centred around the capital. As regards recent newspaper reports on a second terminal at Dublin Airport which the Minister, and indeed everyone, welcomed, will this not mean further advancement of the Dublin area as the ideal location for short-based holidays and therefore create even greater problems for the south and the entire western seaboard? I welcome what the Minister said as regards the various offices that now depict the different regions. Is there any mechanism to enhance further usage of the many airports that we now have? Many airports are being actively used as regards access to the city, but we do not appear to be bringing in holiday makers to these designated airports which would benefit the tourist industry as a whole.

Access is crucially important as regards bringing people to the regions. A number of developments late in 2004 will help considerably in that respect. Ryanair announced that it would utilise Shannon as a European hub. That is of enormous importance because it means people from Europe will be brought directly into the mid-west and the west in increasing numbers. American Airlines, the largest airline in the world, whose representatives I met last October in Dallas, announced it is to operate daily flights from Chicago and Boston into Dublin and Shannon. This is enormously significant for the Shannon region in particular. It means the single largest airline in the world will be flying directly from the United States into the mid-west, which everyone will welcome. Increasing interest in Ireland by American airlines is also evidenced in the fact that Continental Airlines has decided to fly directly across the Atlantic into Belfast, a first for an American airline.In general terms there is an increasing amount of interest by national and international airlines in the Irish regions and the constant development of our regional airports is of crucial importance in that respect. This is why I welcome the Minister of Transport's initiatives towards ensuring the regional airports are sufficiently marketed. I am acutely conscious that air access is just one element of travel. There is also the question of ferry access. Increasingly, we see greater numbers of visitors who come by ferry from Britain and France and travel to the regions in particular. I hope that in the course of 2005 we continue to improve access into the regions and in the final analysis that is the key.A major marketing campaign is currently underway in Britain. Last year saw the greatest number of visitors in its history coming to the island of Ireland. There was a fall-off of about 1% in British visitors, nonetheless. A fall-off of 1% in British visitors is equivalent to a drop of 47,500 approximately. That is why the British market is of such vital importance. A stronger marketing campaign in Britain should bring in more visitors from there who traditionally travel to the Irish regions. There was a substantial increase in American visitors last year and I believe that will be replicated in 2005, judging by what I encountered on my visit to the United States when I addressed various meetings on the attractions of Ireland for American tourists.

The current local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, was closed to applications on 31 July 2000. The programme does not include the provision of a swimming pool in Lucan as South Dublin County Council were proposing at that time to provide a pool there on the basis of a public private partnership arrangement.Although there are no plans to reopen the programme at present, my Department is carrying out an expenditure review which will assist in the formulation of policy for future programmes. The review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. As part of the analysis, the review will address the question of the population catchment area. The potential contribution of options such as private sector involvement in the provision of swimming pool facilities will also be evaluated.

I would like to discuss that at a later date. We know the story about the bureaucracy of South Dublin County Council and the long delay in the guidelines for public private partnership. We know that the Department has stated that the public private partnership process is not necessarily the best way to develop the swimming pool. Given the size of Lucan in comparison to towns such as Birr, which has had a swimming pool for many years, if an application came in from South Dublin County Council and if a concerted community effort was made to push for a swimming pool at the Lucan Sports and Leisure Centre or at Adamstown, what response would the Minister give? Would he make a special case for it, given that Lucan is the fastest growing town in Ireland?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I have the greatest sympathy for the people of Lucan. I regret the fact that no application arrived in respect of Lucan from South Dublin County Council prior to the deadline on 31 July 2000. This deadline was well advertised and everyone knew about it. We received a considerable number of applications from all around the country, including the Dublin region. In 2002, in response to a query about a possible project in Lucan, the following advice was given.Any guidelines in relation to the involvement of local authorities in a public private partnership approach to the procurement of swimming pools will be finalised in the context of launching a new programme. Local authorities will be notified by this Department when the new programme is initiated.However, no such new programme was launched. The reality is that we have several applications on hand at various stages, from preliminary report stage right up to tender stage. We received no application from Lucan prior to the closing date of 31 July 2000. Had we received an application from Lucan, it would have received the priority which it unquestionably deserved. The difficulty is that we do not have a new swimming pool programme at this point. When a new programme is launched, we will advertise for it in the same manner in which we advertised on the previous occasion.I do not understand why there was no application from Lucan, but I do not think that Deputy Gogarty is so unreasonable as to blame me or my Department for the failure to put in an application on behalf of the people of Lucan.

Indeed, I have met deputations in that respect. The real difficulty is that I do not have a new programme at the moment. In Monaghan the municipal pool closed down due to serious damage and the special case was allowed. If it were at all possible to allow others for the same reason, then I would be disposed to do so.The unfortunate situation is that Lucan does not fall within that category. That is no consolation for the people of Lucan. I will try to find out if it is possible to formulate some new programme which might help us to advance pools in places like Lucan. Even in the last couple of years, it is true that the demographics are changing dramatically. Areas that may not have felt it necessary for a pool a few years ago now feel that it is absolutely vital. It is important that the Government keeps up with people's desires, needs and wishes. I hope that we will have a new programme and that we can move along with this. We will certainly keep this under review.

We have 15 projects completed, ten others are at construction stage, two are at tender stage, 12 are at contract document stage and 16 are at preliminary report stage. Of that 16, nine are now seeking approval preliminary reports, two are preparing preliminary reports and five have submitted feasibility studies. There is great interest in this programme. If we were to advertise a new programme in the morning, we would have further interest straight away.

The Irish genealogical project is building a very valuable genealogical resource which documents the key life events of all our ancestors. The Internet presents us with an opportunity to make an index of genealogical data available to all those who seek to trace their ancestry. I launched the Irish Genealogy Limited website in October 2002. A key feature of this website is the central signposting index, which is a database of 2.8 million records now available to search on the Internet.Irish Genealogy Limited was incorporated in 1993 to function as the central co-ordinating and marketing agency for the Irish genealogical project. The project's primary aim is to include all church and civil records up to 1900. The number of records involved is in excess of 20 million. The updating of parish or church records is a central platform in the creation of a genealogical database because they predate civil registration. To date, more that three quarters of the target church records have been indexed by the 35 county based genealogy centres. The business plan for Irish Genealogy Limited for the years 2005-07 aims to have completed 90% of church records by the end of 2007. This year, I am allocating €395,000 to Irish Genealogy Limited, which is up 4% on spending last year, to enable the company press ahead with the delivery of its business plan.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	234	When this project was set up, 1994 was given as the date of completion. Yet ten years later, we have a considerable way to go. As a result, many people living in countries such as the US, where 40 million people claim Irish ancestry, and in other places, such as the UK, Australia and Argentina, are very disappointed that they cannot trace their roots. There is a growing interest in genealogy and it is a very important element of our tourist industry. When foreigners make the genealogical connection, they come to Ireland to find their roots. In view of the importance of this project, will the Minister consider allocating additional financial resources? This year's increase is only €15,000 more than last year. Will he consider additional recruitment so that more people can go through the records?It is a matter of financial resources and personnel. The records are there to be recorded, but the resources are not there to record them. Will the Minister prioritise this area of responsibility? It is very important for the reasons outlined.

It is desirable that we increase it further, but unfortunately I do not have the resources required. It is encouraging that the project will be 97% complete by the end of 2007. Substantial progress has been made and I agree with Deputy Deenihan that it is of immense importance from the perspectives of Irish emigrants and their descendents who are seeking to ascertain their roots. The project has been extremely successful and while it would be desirable to conclude it even more expeditiously, the fact that it will be completed in the not-too-distant future is worthy of note.

While the Minister provided a very comprehensive answer earlier, there are other questions to ask. One of the reasons for the fall off in tourist numbers in the midlands and west is our seeming failure to communicate to tourists from the United Kingdom a reason to come to Ireland. Previously, tourists came here because we successfully communicated reasons of landscape and culture. Current research indicates that British tourists no longer consider themselves to have a good reason to come here. It is very important for Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to sell reasons for people abroad to come here.The major collapse in the British leisure market has been manifested in the declining number of walkers, golfers, anglers and pleasure boaters coming to central Ireland. Does the Minister have any views on how we can better communicate the message that tourists should come here? Does he have any proposals to arrest the decline in the British leisure market and the numbers coming here for leisure activities? I am sure the Minister agrees that the nature of holidaying has changed. People take three or four short breaks each year rather than the traditional two weeks.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	241	In replying to Question No. 4, I set out the details of plans we have made and implemented with a view to redressing the imbalance to which Deputy Deenihan referred. It certainly exists. Last year saw the largest number of visitors ever to our shores of 6.4 million. Revenue from tourism also increased. While the number of tourists from mainland Europe and the United States of America increased substantially, the difficulty arose with a slight drop off of approximately 1% in the number of visitors from Britain. Several factors were involved in this trend, not least of which was competition from within Britain itself where a major campaign was launched by tourism interests with a view to keeping people at home. In addition, independent former eastern bloc countries ran major campaigns in Britain.It is sometimes forgotten that intrinsically attached to fluctuations in visitor numbers from Britain is the exchange rate between sterling and the euro. Currently, the value of the dollar against the euro disincentivises some Americans from travelling to Ireland despite the growth of the market. Tourism Ireland is engaged in the most aggressive marketing campaign in which it has ever been involved in Britain where we are spending approximately 38% of our total marketing fund this year to redress any difficulties which arose last year. Incidentally, a decrease of 1% in the British market last year represented a pretty good result by international standards. Given the decline in visitor numbers from Britain to other countries, one could describe the Irish experience as a heel against the head. I hope sincerely that Ireland has many heels against the head on 27 February at Lansdowne Road.

Does he think an opportunity is being missed in the context of access for walkers? High profile parts of the west are still the subject of ongoing, serious and contentious problems notwithstanding the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe. Members will recall the debate on public rights of way in the House. Can the Minister do anything to ensure that the numerous scenic walkways in the midlands and Ulster become the focus of a marketing initiative by Fáilte Ireland?

While the south west and north west did not experience an increase, Dublin saw an increase of the significant order of 11%. I have acknowledged that while numbers increased, not every area and sector benefited. While the hotels sector did well, the bed and breakfast and farmhouse-guesthouse sector did not. While Dublin did extremely well, the south west, north west and west were not as successful. Our challenge is to establish a degree of equality or equivalence among sectors and regions. I outlined in reply to Question No. 4 the steps being taken to ensure that happens.Deputy Gogarty is correct to imply that walking holidays are of immense importance. Comhairle na Tuaithe was established to resolve the problems landowners had with access and liability for accidents which occurred on their properties. Recent judgments on the Occupiers' Liability Act 1995 have been of great benefit to landowners who may now feel encouraged to allow walkers to access their lands with a degree of confidence. I encourage and respectfully request landowners to assist the national cause of tourism by opening their lands to walkers. It is important to the country and might even be described as a patriotic act.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Does the Minister have any evidence to support the claim that visitors to the Dublin region are mainly young people on short holidays rather than families? The loss to the sector involves the reduction in the number of families coming here. Short holidays seem to be popular with young people. As we know with regard to wedding fairs etc., we have such visitors. We are losing out on families coming to Ireland. Young people come for festivals or international gigs to see bands such as U2 and others. We receive many such visitors, but in the overall context, families are not coming here. When they do, they do not visit the west and other similar regions. With regard to partying, the holidaymaker is focused on where the action is.

If he is past it, that is his business. He is right in that many visitors coming from Britain are young people and they come for the events he described. They are more than welcome. However, we are also getting other kinds of visitors. Family visitors tend to spread out into the regions.It is interesting to note from data that visitors coming to Ireland from the United States are normally over the age of 35, fairly educated, used to travelling and discerning. That is important because that kind of visitor spreads out into the regions, which is why we are so interested in growing the American market to have equivalence among the regions. We have a good marketing campaign in the US. There are eight large travel agent seminars this year in major cities in the US, and such seminars are very successful. I attended and spoke at one in Los Angeles last week. The major players in the trade in California were at the event and this has been replicated in other US cities.I anticipate a substantial increase in the number of visitors from the US and, because of the age profile and other profiles attached to visitors from there, I anticipate an increase in the number of visitors to the regions this year. Allied to the other measures which I mentioned in reply to Question No. 4, this should ensure a much greater degree of equivalence. I am expecting that 2005 will surpass our best year, 2004. I hope this is reflected not just in Dublin but in the regions and sectors.

They come for shorter breaks and they travel by air. There is an increase in the number coming to Ireland by air, and this is likely to increase further in future.

Will he try to address the issue of car hire? It has become more competitive but it could be more attractive.Regarding the issue of regional tourism authorities, RTAs, will the Minister outline the review he is carrying out and which he promised on a number of occasions? It is also contained in the New Horizons report. A dynamic RTA can encourage many people to visit a region, which is important in the context of spread.The Minister has been successful in bringing "Lassie" to Ireland.

On a serious note, we are very pleased that Classic Media has decided to locate the"Lassie" film in Ireland. Filming begins in April of this year, and it is an exciting project. When discussing this with Classic Media last week in New York, I brought along a representative of Tourism Ireland to discuss the possibility of the film being joined up for tourism purposes in terms of the promotion of the island of Ireland. Classic Media was quite excited about this.

We are particularly suited to Classic Media because all film relief uniquely applies not only to films but also to television projects. Classic Media has many property rights in the television market and is the provider of "Lassie".With regard to the question of car hire, one of the most disappointing occurrences in Ireland in recent times is that visitors coming in from abroad who are over the age of 70 find it difficult to get insurance. That is desperately unfair, not just on the country but on the people coming in seeking to hire cars. It is a complaint which I heard in the US on a number of occasions. Just because a person is over the age of 70, he or she should not be denied insurance. Where this occurs, it should be reviewed and examined as a matter of urgency.It is true there was a decline in the number of people travelling to Ireland by ferry last year and this obviously had an adverse effect on the tourism industry. This would be indicative of a decrease in the number of visitors from Britain, which at approximately 1% was very slight. A major marketing drive, which takes up about 38% of our marketing funds for 2005, is taking place in Britain and should yield significant results.The RTAs are being reviewed in the context of the New Horizons report and the implementation group is specifically looking at the relationship between the RTAs, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. This is necessary because despite that we transferred functions from Fáilte Ireland to Tourism Ireland and defined the functions of Fáilte Ireland, we never really defined the relationship between the RTAs, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. We increased funding for RTAs this year by 20%, underlining the importance I attach to the regions. It is important the RTAs become ever more viable in order that we ensure they are in a position to market their regions effectively on the national and international stage.I am particularly pleased at the increase in the domestic market during 2004. This is our largest market and it increased by 16% and was worth revenue of €1.2 billion.

UCD's plans for completing this process are well advanced but the financial issues around the provision of additional accommodation at Belfield have yet to be resolved. My Department has been engaged in a series of discussions with the Department of Education and Science, the Office of Public Works and University College Dublin to clarify the financial and other implications of meeting the needs both of UCD and the National Concert Hall. These discussion are continuing but I hope to be in a position to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, the parameters of a joint submission to Government on these interlocking issues in the near future.

Hopefully, however, it will not be put on the back burner. I am sure the Minister will agree that the provision of an enlarged national concert hall is important for the country. Currently, a number of international performances cannot take place in Dublin due to the lack of proper facilities, including stage size and changing areas. Those of us who are familiar with the National Concert Hall can fully appreciate that situation.At the moment, the concert hall can be booked out for popular performances so there is a need for a new hall to cater for audience requirements.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The National Concert Hall is currently working at full capacity. It is likely that UCD will be moving out of the Earlsfort Terrace site at the end of 2006, so surely it is now time for the advance planning to commence on a blueprint for a new concert hall facility. The planning mechanism should be put in place immediately. A symphony hall with capacity for 2,000 places should be provided, while leaving the existing concert hall in situ. Does the Minister agree that the project is urgent and cannot wait until UCD eventually decides to move out?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Originally, negotiations were entered into with the Dublin Docklands Authority with a view to obtaining a site for the construction of a new national concert hall. However, these discussions fell through when the Dublin Docklands Authority withdrew its offer of the site under consideration. Subsequently, the Office of Public Works was asked to report on the feasibility of locating the concert hall at Earlsfort Terrace. Happily, the OPW concluded that, provided all the site was made available, a national concert hall could be accommodated at Earlsfort Terrace.This is welcome news because it is an ideal location for the national concert hall. Deputy Deenihan points out correctly that it would be possible to construct the new national concert hall and, for the most part, continue with performances in the old concert hall at Earlsfort Terrace. It is estimated that the concert hall could be constructed on a phased basis over a five-year period. It would be a state-of-the-art facility. I appreciate the need for it and I accept that the current facilities are entirely inadequate. We are continuing to make progress. I will discuss with the Minister for Education and Science a joint approach to Government in the near future regarding the Earlsfort Terrace site.

A strong focus in my Department in recent years has been the retention of the section 481 incentive scheme for investors in film production in Ireland. In this context, a report commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers by the Irish Film Board, in conjunction with my Department, concluded in September 2003 that the discontinuation of the scheme would result in the displacement of more than 3,500 jobs within the economy, an annual reduction of circa €60 million in national output and a reduction of more than €35 million on the current account of the balance of payments.A review of film production in Ireland, published by the audio-visual federation of IBEC, concluded that total expenditure on feature films and major television drama, independent TV productions and animation came to €190.9 million in 2002 and €320.2 million in 2003. Of these amounts, €122.6 million was spent in Ireland in 2002 and €151.4 million in 2003.IBEC estimates that a total of 16,424 people were directly placed on 148 productions in Ireland in 2002, of which 67% were Irish. These figures exclude direct and indirect employment generated through total Irish expenditure of €122.6 million in the Irish economy. A total of 2,111,560 work hours were generated, which translates into 1,198 full-time equivalents.For 2003, a total of 12,238 placements were directly made on 179 productions, of which 94% were Irish. These figures exclude direct and indirect employment generated through a total Irish spend of €151.4 million in the economy. A total of 2,629,824 hours were generated, translating into 1,491 full-time equivalents. The figures for 2004 are not yet to hand.The Government's decision, taken in conjunction with the Finance Act 2004, to extend section 481 relief to 2008 and to increase the ceiling on the amount which may be raised from €10.48 million to €15 million with effect from 1 January this year enables film makers both here and abroad to plan their projects in a climate of greater certainty. I underlined this message in my visits to a wide range of film studios in the course of my visit to the United States last week. I have also increased by 20% the funding available to the Irish Film Board.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I welcome the Minister's reply which indicates the value of the film industry here. It is important to provide the necessary expertise and incentives to ensure the continued progress of the film industry, which is of vital importance. Recently, I met the young Irish film makers group which has made a submission to the Minister for funding. It is seeking grants to develop its involvement in film making. Obviously, those people are the experts of tomorrow and unless they receive basic training we will have problems. What is the status of the group's application and can it be developed further to ensure that progress is made?I welcome the decision on extending the application of section 481 which will have a positive effect. The Minister's recent visit to America has demonstrated the benefits that can accrue from such incentives. Nonetheless, can something be done for the young Irish film makers group? It has a major interest in the industry but it has become bogged down in its quest for vital funding.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The issue of young Irish film makers was also brought to my attention by Deputy McGuinness who said there is a major problem with funding for them. Deputy Wall has buttressed that argument here today. On the previous occasion the matter was raised by Deputy McGuinness, I referred it to the Irish Film Board. Following Deputy Wall's intervention now, I will again refer the issue to the board to see if progress can be made. In the final analysis, funding of young Irish film makers is a question for the Irish Film Board whose budget was increased by 20% this year. I will refer the Deputy's query to the board.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank the Minister.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Since I assumed responsibility for the tourism portfolio, I have had a consistent focus on the competitiveness of the Irish tourism product. My focus is not so much on price as on value and my message is not so much about high prices as value for money. The industry must monitor its prices by reference to the value it provides. However, Ireland has not been, for many years, a cheap holiday destination. It has never been, nor does it intend to be, on a par with the cheap mass market destinations.However, Ireland was competitive in the 1990s. It has always been my view that, if Ireland's tourism industry is to restore the competitiveness it enjoyed in the boom years, a multifaceted approach by both the private and public sectors is required. Competitiveness is a function of the overall tourism experience and not price alone. We have put a new tourism strategy in place to address the key challenges facing domestic tourism to build on the report of the tourism policy review group. The review group recommended more than 70 actions that must be delivered if that new strategy is to be successful.The first progress report by the high level tourism action plan implementation group, published last September, was broadly positive. Few people were surprised that strong areas of concern remain regarding the competitiveness and value for money available in wide segments of Irish tourism. However, in general, the industry is addressing the competitiveness issue seriously, which is a mark of how serious the pressure is on industry yield and profit brought about by a stronger focus on price and value for money in the marketplace. This is also evident in the wide range of special discounted offers available from the air and ferry companies and accommodation providers.The strong euro and related weakening of the dollar and sterling present additional challenges for domestic tourism in terms of the perception of value for money. Levels of dissatisfaction are closely linked to exchange rate changes. A variety of trends are emerging from the analysis of 2004 performance figures that will require attention from the industry and the tourism agencies, if we are to achieve the rate of growth envisaged for the sector in the report of the tourism policy review group.I have again secured a record level of Exchequer moneys for investment in tourism this year which, at €123 million, amounts to an 8% increase on 2004. The enhanced budgets for the tourism State agencies have enabled them to produce excellent operational and marketing plans for the year, which will help to enhance the overall competitiveness of the tourism industry through a range of supporting programmes and initiatives.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I fully support the efforts of Fáilte Ireland and the Department to ensure tourists obtain maximum value. However, a recent report in the Irish Independent pointed out that when a concert is held in Dublin, one hotel increases its room rate from €129 per night to €229 while another increased its rate from €215 to €425. This is disingenuous of hoteliers given that the Minister and everyone else involved are trying to attract tourists. Hoteliers are trying to kill the goose that laid the golden egg by inflating prices for specific events. Similar increases will be effected on the weekends of the rugby internationals and the U2 concert. Can the Minister do anything to address this? The Irish Hotels Federation should also address this issue.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Individual hoteliers decide of their own volition that they should make hay because the sun shines during certain periods of the year. Accordingly, a major event in a city or town can lead people to the conclusion that they should increase their prices beyond all recognition. This must be discouraged and condemned. People who take advantage of a special occasion or function undermine the efforts of State agencies to sell the country. It also gives encouragement to those who seek to establish that restrictive or unfair practices operate in the industry. I request all those who seek to take advantage of given occasions or functions to seriously consider the implications of their actions. People who decide to do this to the disadvantage of the customer undermine the business of which they are a part. Increasing prices to avail of a given opportunity is not a good medium or long-term strategy. There may be short-term gain but medium and long-term damage is certain.Written answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. The IDA invited proposals in July 2004 for collaborative groups of academic institutions to undertake the establishment of the national institute for bioprocessing research and training. The three main functions of the new institute will be training and education in bioprocessing, research in bioprocessing technologies and scale up capabilities for the stakeholder institutions. It is envisaged that the institute will be a state-of-the-art national facility designed to give Ireland a competitive advantage and act as a magnet for the attraction of further significant investment in the biopharmaceutical industry in Ireland by foreign and indigenous companies and to encourage existing foreign-owned and indigenous companies to establish start up ventures in Ireland.One of the key elements of the proposal was the location of the institute. The documentation stated the chosen location would best facilitate the interaction of the industry and the academic institutions. Athlone in the midlands is the best location. Athlone Institute of Technology together with Dublin City University, NUI Galway and a number of other institutions made a submission to the IDA a number of years to establish the institute in Athlone. This was supported and encouraged by the IDA at the time and Mr. Sean Dorgan, its chief executive, publicly indicated the project would be developed on a campus in Athlone. The four local authorities in the midlands also supported the project.However, a number of the larger universities and biopharmaceutical companies in the State got wind of what was happening and kicked up a stink, with the result that an expanded competition was run. The Government selected UCD as the preferred bidder for the €90 million project. The State is in negotiations with UCD, Trinity College, Dublin and Sligo Institute of Technology to develop the campus in Dublin. To date, detailed discussions have taken place but the door is still ajar in regard to the location of the proposed site and what will be the lead institution in regard to it.I ask the Minister to reconsider the DCU bid which has been made in conjunction with Athlone Institute of Technology and other third level institutions. If it is not possible to reopen negotiations with DCU I urge the Minister to negotiate with UCD and TCD to locate in the heart of the BMW region, the town of Athlone. As yet, no decision has been taken in regard to location and it is critically important that a decision is taken. It is a significant opportunity for the midlands.Athlone has been designated a gateway town. We should support the location of this proposed centre in Athlone. Athlone has also lost the eBay investment, which was a great blow to the town. An announcement was made recently about the location of Yahoo in Dublin.There is too much of a focus on Dublin in the biopharmaceutical industry. Great pressure and demand already exists in this area. Centres of excellence and biotech clusters already exist in Dublin. We must start looking and expanding outside Dublin. The midlands has a strong reputation in the biopharmaceutical industry, and Athlone is the capital of that sector. The Taoiseach was in Athlone recently to open Pharmaplaz, a new indigenous biopharmaceutical company. It is critically important that the Government takes the lead in regard to this and makes a decision to locate that facility in Athlone, which is the most central location in the country that can easily feed into the other academic institutions and to the biopharmaceutical companies, not only in Dublin but also in the rest of the country. It is important that we look at expanding the clusters we have and not just continue to focus on Dublin. The Minister should ensure this vital decision is taken in favour of the midlands and Athlone.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I wish to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin.IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. While the Minister may give general policy directives to the agency, he is precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.IDA Ireland has informed the Minister that, following wide consultation in the US and Europe with businesses and academia in the biotechnology industry and taking into account the key educational and industrial issues that it has identified, the agency believes that Ireland should make a strategic competitive investment and establish a national bioprocessing research, education, training and service facility.According to IDA Ireland vision, such a facility should have three primary functions: training and education in bioprocessing; research in bioprocessing technologies; and scale-up capability to service the research, training, education and service needs of the institutes' stakeholders.IDA Ireland envisages the facility will be a state-of-the-art national institute designed to provide, in conjunction with academic institutes, a substantive output of people with high level, best practice skills across the spectrum of bioprocessing activities, applicable in a real time scale-up environment. It is envisaged that it will undertake academic and industry collaborative research with an emphasis on advancing knowledge in bioprocessing technologies and techniques, the technical problems of scale-up and related issues. It will give Ireland a competitive advantage and act as a magnet of attraction for further significant investment in the biopharmaceutical industry in Ireland by both overseas and indigenous companies. It will also encourage the development of existing foreign-owned and indigenous biopharmaceutical sector and the establishment of new start-up ventures in Ireland.On 23 July 2004, IDA Ireland, through a series of newspaper advertisements, invited proposals from collaborative groups of academic institutions to undertake the establishment of the national institute of bioprocessing research and training in Ireland. A detailed invitation specification document was issued to prospective applicants which outlined the background to the needs to be addressed, required elements, outputs and deliverables expected, criteria for adjudication and the proposal content details to be submitted. This invitation clearly spelled out the need for approval by the IDA Ireland board and the Government for any funding but also reserved the right not to accept any proposal.Proposals were received from three consortia by the closing date of 15 October 2004 and a panel of international experts reviewed the quality, value and impact of the proposed activity on 15 November 2004. The panel's evaluation report, which recommended that IDA Ireland in the first instance negotiate with the consortium led by UCD, with Trinity College Dublin and Sligo Institute of Technology as partners, was considered by the board of IDA Ireland on 8 December 2004. They agreed to proceed to the next stage of the process and commence negotiations as recommended by the panel.The Minister understands that these negotiations are well under way and are dealing with a wide range of substantive issues and recommendations identified in the evaluation report which were considered by the international experts to be necessary for the successful establishment of the institute. Needless to say, the issue of location will be an integral part of this negotiation process.It is anticipated that a proposal which addresses all the issues for success will be considered by the board of IDA Ireland within the coming months before being recommended to Government for consideration.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this important matter. Next year the upgrading of the M50 will commence and I hope the last section in Carrickmines and Cherrywood in my constituency will be completed. The building of the port tunnel led to the belief that heavy goods vehicles would be removed from the streets of Dublin city. This dream will not be delivered if the Minister insists on leaving the Dublin port tunnel at an operational height of 4.65 m. The Dublin port tunnel is a vital strategic link in the country's transport infrastructure. We must accommodate in the port tunnel the vehicles which are accommodated on the national network. Motorway bridges around the country are constructed to a height of 5.3 m and the Luas bridge in Dundrum is at a height of 5.5 m.At a recent public inquiry into the upgrading of the M50-M3 junction, the two tunnels that are proposed to be built at the Castleknock-Blanchardstown interchange are to an agreed height of 5.3 m. The argument that a lane width of 3.5 m is unsafe is simply wrong. The Vielha tunnel which links Spain and France and is a 5 km long tunnel is being constructed to a European standard of 5.3 m wide and a height of 5.25 m. This is international best practice and contradicts the advice that the NRA has given to the Department. The effect of not increasing the tunnel height would be to force "supercube" lorries on to our city streets with all the attendant traffic problems that would result.On the subject of both safety and traffic management, the ventilation system requires that traffic does not stall in the tunnel so a holding bay at both ends of it, in Ringsend and at Fairview and Drumcondra on the northern side, will have to be established. This will have a direct impact on the management and functioning of the East Link bridge on the south side which currently handles a maximum capacity of 22,000 cars per day.National Toll Roads has already flagged in the newspapers this week that traffic chaos will ensue to an already gridlocked M50 if these holding bays are to become a reality. If we add to this the five-year road works that the M50 has allowed for, the result would be catastrophic. The sum of €770 million has been invested in the tunnel to date but it will fail in its objective if we continue this approach.In the past we did not invest in a trefoil system around the Red Cow interchange on the basis of its €65 million cost. We now regret that we did not make such an investment. It is time to call stop and for the Minister to realise that we have to make the right decision before it is too late. We cannot make short-term decisions, as was done by not investing in trefoil junctions.Consultants estimated that the cost of making the required changes would be in the region of €30 million to €60 million, which is considerably less than their original €100 million estimate when the change was first mooted. While it may delay completion of the project, we should build a tunnel that will serve its purpose and the needs of tomorrow as well as today. The Minister has been warned and it is now time to take action to solve this problem. I urge the Minister for Transport to re-examine the Dublin Port tunnel height.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I wish to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the local authority concerned which, in the case of the Dublin Port tunnel, is Dublin City Council. The Minister for Transport announced on 21 October 2004 that the operational height of the Dublin Port tunnel will not be changed and that its construction will be completed as planned with an operational height of 4.65 metres. That decision was based primarily on safety grounds but cost and time were also factors.The options for increasing the height of the tunnel were considered by the National Roads Authority, independent consultants, Atkins, and Dublin City Council. In addition, the contractor, NMI, priced the work which would be involved in increasing the height of the tunnel. It was clear from this analysis that raising the height of the tunnel would not be justified having regard to safety, cost and delay factors. In so far as safety issues were concerned, the main issues related to the reduction in lane widths and increasing kerb height, which would have been required to secure an increase in tunnel height. The implications of overheight HGVs for the rest of the national road network also had to be taken into account.The priority now is to secure completion as quickly as possible of a safe tunnel facility in line with best international practice. The operational height of the tunnel when complete at 4.65 metres will be greater than that applicable in most other EU member states. I understand from the NRA and Dublin City Council that the construction of the port tunnel is expected to be completed in December 2005 and the tunnel will be open to traffic six to eight weeks later following commissioning of the tunnel's operations and safety features. The issue of traffic management following the opening of the tunnel is a matter for Dublin City Council.I understand that it is the view of Dublin City Council and the National Roads Authority that the Dublin Port tunnel will facilitate almost all the truck traffic using Dublin Port. Two vehicle height surveys of HGVs using Dublin Port have been carried out, one by the Dublin Port Company and one by the National Institute of Transport Logistics, which indicate that between 0.6% to 1.7% of HGVs entering and leaving the port exceed 4.65 metres. It is clear, therefore, that a very limited proportion of HGVs using the port will not be able to use the Dublin Port tunnel.The issue of routing of vehicles greater than 4.65 metres will be addressed in the context of a HGV management strategy being prepared by Dublin City Council. I understand that the HGV management strategy, revised to take account of submissions received during a public consultation period, will be published shortly. It should also be noted that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport recently published a consultation document on the broader question of a maximum height limit for vehicles. Some 41 submissions were received from corporate entities, representative groups and individuals. These submissions are being considered with a view to a definitive position on the issue. I hope the foregoing clarifies the position for the Deputy.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I thank the Minister for coming to the House. This time last year, I rose in the House to express the devastation which was felt by my constituents in Kilbarrack's Foxfield-St. John's parish and east Kilbarrack in particular at the closure of Greendale community school. Without any consultation, the trustees, namely, the Jesuit Order, Holy Faith Order and the vocational education committee, decided or advised the Department of Education and Science on a closure. The staff, principal, parents, students and the local community of Kilbarrack were devastated, especially given the school's very impressive history since 1975 and from its peak enrolment of almost 1,000 students. Currently it has more than 1,000 adult and post leaving certificate students.It was no wonder that during last year's elections, a campaign called SOS — Save our School was mounted. It is still the wish of the district that Greendale community school remains open. The Minister will know of some of the school's famous staff such as the great Brian Mullins, Roddy Doyle, Paul Mercier and others of a total of 30 hard-working and distinguished teachers who carried on the tradition for the people of Kilbarrack and Raheny over the past three decades.I recently met the school stewards, Ms Niamh O'Dwyer of the TUI and Ms Maura Cullen of the ASTI, who gave me a dreadfully worrying account of the grave problems which have been imposed on the school by this precipitate closure. They outline the difficulties which will ensue for staff and students from the lack of consultation or liaison with the Minister's Department to date in regard to the future of staff and students. The 29 full-time staff and large number of part-time staff have had no communication about their future. The Minister and I both come from educational backgrounds and know how worrying and upsetting this must be for people with families and mortgages to consider. It is not good enough that we have not clearly spelt out what will be the future of the current school staff.It is important that the Minister takes a hands-on approach to this matter, examines it urgently and liaises with the principal, Anton Carroll, and his distinguished staff. She should advise them of what will happen in the next two and a half years. We do not seem to have a modus operandi for the closure of a second level school, although we have seen closures of primary schools as the population works its way up. We need more primary level schools now but it is proposed to close no less than three very distinguished second level schools in my constituency, including Greendale community school.The staff representatives are particularly concerned about part-time staff, some of whom have worked at the school for more than six years and have contracts of indefinite duration. Their futures are in limbo and we need to spell out clearly what will happen to them. Staff representatives also have grave concerns about the students because of what is happening in the school and because a closure date of 2007 has been indicated. There will be no first or transition year students in September and the number of students in sixth year has fallen to 28. They are very concerned as to how, when redeployment and retirement of staff comes into play, the principal, Anton Carroll, and his board will provide sufficient curriculum cover for all the students and ensure that the excellent and tremendous education which has been carried on at that campus for the past 30 years is continued until its closure.My constituents do not want the school to close but they are very anxious that the campus remains as an educational campus. However, given that we are in this situation, it is important that the Minister liaises with the school and I appeal to her to do so. It must be disorienting and disturbing for staff, students, parents and the Kilbarrack and Raheny communities that this situation exists and I ask the Minister to take a sympathetic and considerate view of the current circumstances and ask her to have her staff immediately liaise closely with the principal, Anton Carroll, his staff, parents and pupils to try to manage this difficult situation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue. He is quite correct that the closure of a school has an effect not just on the staff and students in the school but on the community, particularly a school as distinguished as Greendale community school which, as the Deputy pointed out, has served the area very well from the time it was built to a peak of more than 900 pupils. The Deputy mentioned some of the more famous staff members and past pupils but the school aims to ensure that every child reached his or her potential. Therefore, I can understand that there is a great deal of sensitivity surrounding the decision by the trustees to close the school.When one examines the demographics of the area, one can understand how they came to this decision because there has been a steady decline in enrolments over the years. Since 1996, enrolment has declined by 50%. In less than nine years, it has fallen from 449 students to 215 students in the 2003-04 school year and the current enrolment at the primary schools in the area would indicate that the decline will continue. Unfortunately, the numbers are not there.

The school made an application to the Department of Education and Science for major capital investment in 1999 and the study commissioned by the Department estimated that an investment of €2.5 million would be needed for the remedial works. The general decline in enrolments in the area has resulted in spare capacity in the area of 2,300 places at post-primary level. It appears that Deputy Broughan's constituency is disappearing. In the circumstances, my Department did not consider that the level of capital investment required was a viable option, but it gave grant aid for the immediate health and safety issues at the school.Subsequent to this, the Department of Education and Science held meetings with the trustees to discuss the future of the school because there did not appear to be adequate pupil numbers in the locality to enable it to regenerate. We were also concerned at the ability of the school to offer a broad and balanced curriculum, given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled. The trustees advised the Department in March 2004 that a decision had been taken to close the school in June 2007 and that there would be no intake of pupils in September 2005.My Department concurred with the recommendations in light of the falling enrolment and taking into consideration the surplus capacity in the general area. It was a matter for the trustees to discuss this with the board of management, teachers and parents. Unfortunately, no circumstances would allow me to re-examine the issue. In regard to the students, every effort will be made to ensure that the current students and those who will continue in the school until 2007 will continue to get the quality education and curriculum they require to pursue their academic choices.I pay tribute to the staff of the school. It is a difficult time for them and for the community but, given that the school will be in full-time second education use until 2007, the Department has not yet made a decision on the future use of the school buildings and grounds. We must have regard to the fact that it is such a major centre for adult education, and we will consult widely in that regard.

Labharfaidh mé leis an Aire atá freagach as seo arís.This issue is of enormous concern not just to people in Ireland, but to anyone worldwide who is concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and plutonium as a material. We want answers on this issue. In light of this morning's report from the United States Administration that terror groups are planning either chemical or nuclear attacks, it is alarming to hear on the same news reports that 30 kilograms of plutonium was reported missing at Sellafield.The British nuclear group, part of BNFL, describes it as a paper loss. As if to reassure us, it states that it is not of concern to them because they work in tonnes, not kilograms. I doubt that would be of any comfort. The reality is that we should not tolerate the creation of plutonium in milligrams, kilograms or tonnes. The deadliness of plutonium is clear when we recall that, spread evenly around the world, six kilograms of the material would be sufficient to give everyone lung cancer. Therefore, the deadliness of the material is unquestionable. The reason plutonium was first made must be borne in mind. It was used to make bombs and weapons of mass destruction. The reason this country was happy to give succour and facilities to the bombing of Iraq was in the name of doing away with weapons of mass destruction.What we are dealing with here is material for weapons of mass destruction. Some 14 countries are currently storing 235 metric tonnes of separated plutonium, enough for 40,000 Nagasaki-sized bombs. That amount is growing by between five and ten tonnes a year. Sellafield and the organisation that runs that plant assures us that they have safety and security in order. Even after the 11 September attacks in the United States, there were 45 security breaches last year at civil nuclear sites in the UK. While nuclear experts accept some discrepancy in the figures, Dr. Frank Barnaby said that the loss of 30 kg is a dramatic development. In 2003, there was a loss of 19 kg and over the past ten years there was an accumulated loss of 50 kg. Some 30 kilograms is a great loss of nuclear material.I asked the Tánaiste this morning — perhaps the Minister will be able to answer me — whether the Irish Government was told about this before the media were told or the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Agency report was released. The Government claimed at the time of the court case that it had won a concession that it would be in the loop, that information would be shared about British nuclear incidents or issues of concern, and this is certainly one of them. I would like to know whether the UK ambassador has been called in to explain the matter or what action has been taken.Given that the US wants to end reprocessing — the vast majority of people in the world would like to end reprocessing because its only use is to make bombs — and that Ireland was the author and first signatory of a non-proliferation treaty, will the Government convene an international effort to reach a consensus needed to force an end to reprocessing and thereby a reduction of the threat of nuclear weapons? Will the Government address the basic injustice in the EU where the nuclear industry is effectively being promoted and getting the lion's share of research over the combined renewable energies because the EURATOM treaty is a protocol attached to the EU constitution and continues which have favoured place? These matters must be addressed. Will the Government ensure that the sunset clause is included so that the EURATOM treaty fades into the past where it belongs?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I thank Deputy Sargent for allowing me to take this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.I understand the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, British Nuclear Fuels plc and Urenco (Capenhurst) Limited today published details of the nuclear materials balance arising from the use of plutonium and-or uranium in their civil nuclear programmes during 2003 and 2004. Publication of these figures is a voluntary industry practice in the UK introduced in 1977 and repeated annually. On 10 December last, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with the British ambassador, announced the outcome to date of the discussions between the UK and Ireland arising from the legal action brought by Ireland against the UK under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The Minister, Deputy Roche, reported previously to the House on the improved co-operation and information exchange mechanisms put in place arising from these discussions. In accordance with these improved co-operation measures, the Minister directed his officials to raise this matter with the UK authorities to establish the position regarding media reports to the effect that 30 kg of plutonium material had been "lost" or had "disappeared" at Sellafield. Arising from these contacts with the UK Administration, the Minister understands that in the figures published, 30 kg of plutonium has been attributed as "material unaccounted for". This term represents the difference between measured stock and the book account. It arises as a consequence of the accounting process for these nuclear materials and mainly from measurement uncertainties.The Minister received assurances from the UK Government that the figures in this case relate to a "book" discrepancy arising from measurement uncertainties and that there is no evidence to suggest that any of the apparent losses reported are real losses of nuclear material. Apparently, it is not unusual for the accounting process to indicate material unaccounted for and it can have a positive or negative value. The figures published today relate to 2003 and 2004 and have all long since been reported to EURATOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency under the UK's various nuclear safeguards obligations. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, understands that the figures returned are not the subject of further inquiry by these bodies and that they are all within international standards of expected measurement accuracies for closing a nuclear balance at the type of facility concerned. The British Government does not believe the figures have any implications for the state of security at Sellafield and there is no suggestion that any of this material is unaccounted for because of theft or anything else to do with site or transport security.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The UK has emphasised that nuclear materials are protected at all times and levels of security at nuclear sites are very high. All sites are required to comply with a security plan approved by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security and the measures taken exceed international requirements in this area. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to review the information available and advise him accordingly. Should high level action be indicated arising from its advice, he will raise the matters directly with his ministerial counterparts in the UK.With regard to the generation and stockpiling of plutonium generally, it is clear that the present security climate throughout the world is extremely difficult. In this climate, the security implications of the nuclear spent fuel reprocessing industry, in which Sellafield plays a significant role, must be critically addressed. The strong view of the Government is that reprocessing, which results in the transport of spent fuel throughout the world, the transformation of this fuel and the generation of additional nuclear waste and significant amounts of plutonium and other nuclear materials, which must then be transported back and ultimately stockpiled, is correspondingly more problematic. For this reason, the Government is opposed to the continued reprocessing of spent fuel at Sellafield and will continue to utilise all legal and diplomatic opportunities to bring it to an end.On behalf of the Government, the Minister, Deputy Roche, will continue on a bilateral basis with the UK to articulate the concerns and protect the interests of Irish citizens regarding nuclear reprocessing and ensure these views are articulated consistently and cogently at relevant international fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union.

I have been considering how best to showcase Irish arts internationally building in particular on the strong positive image created by the highly successful cultural programme of last years Irish EU Presidency and the work over many years of the cultural relations committee. To assist me in this work, my Department commissioned external consultancy advice from Mr. Eugene Downes, arts consultant, on the structure and content of an international arts promotion strategy appropriate to our circumstances. We have also engaged in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs on our proposals and I am happy to say that there is broad consensus on them. I am now circulating my proposals to my Cabinet colleagues for their information following which I plan to publish an outline of my proposals in the very near future.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The past seven years have seen a substantial investment by this Government in Irish sport with a total of €628 million spent on sport, much of this to support the development of a new sporting infrastructure across Ireland.While the sports capital programme administered by my Department has been enormously beneficial to local sports clubs and community groups throughout the country, a considerable share of the 4,271 projects allocated funding since 1997 were large-scale projects meeting sporting needs at regional and national level. Some of the major projects supported in recent years have included the redevelopment of Croke Park stadium; the national boxing stadium in Dublin; the national hockey stadium at UCD, Dublin; the new national rowing centre at Inniscarra, County Cork; Ireland's new golf academy in Maynooth and Tennis Ireland's new national centre at Glasnevin.It is worth noting, that in this period, grants were also provided under the programme towards essential safety works and the refurbishment of 24 GAA county grounds, 17 Eircom league grounds and the rugby provincial grounds in Connacht, Munster and Leinster.In recent years many regional sports centres have also benefited from grants allocated under the sports capital programme in locations such as Athlone, Bray, Navan, Ballina and Ennis, to name a few. Many of these facilities are also being part funded through my Department's local authority swimming pool programme, which has been in operation since 1999. Under this programme, grants of up to €3.8 million are made available towards either the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of a new pool. Since 2000, 55 swimming projects have or are being dealt with under the programme. Some 15 swimming pool projects have been completed, most recently Finglas in Dublin and Grove Island in Limerick. Since 2000, €46 million has been spent on public swimming pools under this programme with construction currently underway on further swimming pool projects in ten locations around the country.In addition my Department has also funded the provision of 50 m pools at the University of Limerick and the National Aquatic Centre, Abbotstown. In January 2004 to the Government decided to contribute €191 million towards the cost of a new stadium at Lansdowne Road. It will meet all the current international standards for rugby and soccer and the pitch area will be of sufficient size to accommodate both GAA codes. A formal legal agreement has been signed between the Department of Arts Sports and Tourism, the IRFU and the FAI in relation to the procurement of the project. A special purpose company, the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, LRSDC, was established last year and a project director has been appointed to manage the project. A steering group, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, has been set up with representatives of the IRFU, the FAI, the OPW and the Departments of Finance and Arts, Sport and Tourism. Tenders for the appointment of a design team and a project management team are currently being evaluated by the company.In tandem with that decision the Government also decided to proceed with the development of a sports campus on the State owned lands at Abbotstown. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, following a consultative process with sporting organisations has drawn up proposals for the development of a sports campus there. It is my intention to present proposals to the Government shortly on the development of a campus at Abbotstown.It is my intention to bring to Government in the very near future a proposal for a cross-departmental approach long-term strategic planning of investment in sporting infrastructure for the future. The proposed strategy will aim to ensure that an agreed and integrated approach is adopted to planning, funding, provision and management of sports facilities by the current main funding bodies in this area. The proposed strategy will look at the range and need for sporting facilities across the country, including key major facilities, and produce recommendations on priorities for future funding.

These include our use of the English language, our historical links, particularly with the United States, the very high skill and experience levels of our film professionals, our relatively low level of bureaucracy, and the variety of locations available within quite short distances of one another. The Government has done its part in that film producers now have certainty going forward, as the section 481 scheme has been extended to 2008, with the amount that can be raised increasing from €10.48 million to €15 million from 2005.Those met included: Universal Pictures; Walt Disney Studios-Buena Vista International; Paramount Pictures; Sony Pictures; Jerry Bruckheimer Films; 20th Century Fox; Miramax; Greenstreet Films; Imagine Entertainment; and Focus Features.Of course, at these meetings, the studio executives outlined some of the competitive factors facing Ireland in the market for mobile film finance, including competition from new EU member states where wage rates, in particular, are lower than in Ireland, the unfavourable euro-dollar exchange rate, the proliferation of incentive schemes elsewhere, and some infrastructural issues.While in the US, I indicated that I had under consideration basing an Irish film sector representative in Los Angeles who would be charged with effectively communicating with film industry executives on what Ireland can offer, and better informing us at home about the critical factors that sway decisions by studios about where to film.

I will be happy to meet him in that capacity to discuss the future of the national theatre when he takes up his appointment. However, he will not do so for some months.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting organisations, including cycling clubs, and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis and provides funding towards the cost of providing sports facilities and fixed, permanently based sports equipment.Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December last. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. No application was received from the specific club to which the Deputy refers but it is open to that club to apply for funding under the programme in the future.All applications under the 2005 programme which were received before the closing date are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.In addition, section 847a of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides for a scheme for tax relief for relevant donations to an approved sports body for the funding of sports capital projects. The scheme is applicable in cases involving the purchase of land and premises as well as construction and development work.The Irish Sports Council, which is the statutory body responsible for the promotion and development of sport in Ireland, provides funding for the national governing bodies of sport, including Cycling Ireland, to assist in the development of cycling throughout the country.The assistance provided by the council supports Cycling Ireland in the areas of administration, strategic planning and review, the national coaching development programme, sports equipment, international competition, training camps, the international carding scheme and in hosting international events. The council does not pay grants directly to individual clubs in any of the sports it funds.

In 2005, the council has received an allocation of €61 million, which is an increase of around 12% on the total amount provided in 2004, even allowing for the special allocation of €2 million provided late last year, requested by the council to specifically address the position of the Abbey Theatre. It is a matter for the council to decide how its allocation is divided, and the level of support to be given to artists, arts organisations, and art forms.I will shortly announce a successor to the cultural relations committee, CRC, which was responsible for supporting Irish artists who wished to work or exhibit abroad. This new body will have a broader, more proactive remit, and will have an amount of €2 million at its disposal in 2005, as compared with the €700,000 available to the CRC in 2004.

As such, it remains my personal priority, and that of the Government, to have this project brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible date.

These guidelines were drawn up following an extensive public consultative process aimed at giving the scheme a sharper focus and are intended to assist and encourage all Departments and public bodies to participate in the scheme.While it has not been possible to collate global statistics on the level of implementation of the scheme which was extended to all Departments with construction budgets by Government decision in 1997, the available evidence suggests that its implementation may have been somewhat uneven at times.It is hoped that the availability of the guidelines will encourage full implementation of the scheme by all public bodies and my Department has taken an active role in informing all Departments of the need to ensure that the scheme is adopted and promoted in relation to all capital construction projects under their remit.

In it I outlined my views on how the restoration of competitiveness must be addressed by both the private and public sectors.For my part, my contribution is to see a coherent tourism development action plan implemented effectively in co-operation with all the major players. To this end, I established a high-level implementation group to advise and assist in driving forward and monitoring the comprehensive action plan set out in the report of the tourism policy review group, which highlighted the need to restore competitiveness. The implementation group's first progress report has been widely circulated among the industry and it was discussed at the first tourism industry forum on 17 November last. I understand that the group intends to present its second report to me in April.

My Department's annual global subvention to the council takes account, in so far as is possible, of the council's estimates of its requirements for the year in question, which would include, in the normal course, the requirements of arts venues and organisations. I have no plans to establish an additional revenue stream of the kind suggested by the Deputy.

It is expected that both teams will be in place by the end of March 2005. The company intends that a planning application will be pursued during 2005 as soon as possible after these teams have been appointed.In relation to the potential disruption of matches at the stadium, once the construction work gets underway, the stadium will be unavailable for some period of time. I am aware that the IRFU and FAI have considered a number of contingency options for rugby and soccer matches during the period when the existing pitch will be unavailable for a period of time commencing in 2007. While it is a matter for these autonomous sporting bodies to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that their match commitments are met, my Department is in regular liaison with both bodies through the Lansdowne Road stadium steering group.

The review was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of all aspects of the programmes and structures over the course of the four year cycle leading into the Athens games with a view to making recommendations for the development of programmes for the 2008 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games.A review steering group was appointed to oversee the review. The group was chaired by former Enterprise Ireland chief executive, Mr. Dan Flinter and comprised representatives from the Irish Sports Council, Olympic Council of Ireland, Paralympic Council of Ireland, Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and a former Olympic athlete.Wharton Consulting, a leading UK sports consultancy, was appointed in July 2004 to undertake the review. The timeframe over which the review was to be conducted was the five months from the end of July 2004 to December 2004. The current position is that Wharton Consulting presented its report to the review steering group. I understand that it is the intention of the Sports Council to publish the report in the very near future.

It was transferred to my Department from the Department of Foreign Affairs from 1 January 2002. Since then, the committee has had the following amounts at its disposal: 2002, €700,000; 2003; €700,000; 2004, €700,000.My Department has directly managed a major cultural exchange with China, the overseas elements of which cost €706,000 in 2003 and €1.7 million in 2004. My Department was also responsible for the cultural programme run in conjunction with Ireland's EU Presidency, the overseas costs of which came to €94,000 in 2003 and €680,000 in 2004.The elements supported by the committee, and included in the Chinese exchange or the EU cultural programme, were selected on the basis of artistic merit, on the basis of the overall benefits to the arts in Ireland, or where applicable, on the basis of the practical requirements of the context in operation. I will shortly announce a new body to replace the cultural relations committee, which will have a budget of €2 million for 2005. This follows an analysis of how the Irish arts might best be advanced internationally, which included a comparative analysis of the models and approaches that operate in other relevant countries.

For clarification purposes, such fully eligible persons who were in long-term care in the institutions in question for a number of months, who had payments deducted from them for such care, and then returned home are included in the category of person who will receive refunds under the ex gratia scheme.Those qualifying under the scheme will be paid up to €2,000 if they have already paid up to that amount by way of charges. Where persons have been charged anything less than €2,000, they will be refunded the amount they have paid. The scheme does not apply in the case of persons who were in longstay care in the institutions in question but who died before 9 December 2004.If, however, individuals concerned died on or after this date, then payments will be made to the executor or person who has taken out the grant of administration in respect of the individual who has died. The Health Service Executive is making the necessary arrangements with regard to this scheme and payments to those in longstay care have already commenced.My Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General is examining the decision of the Supreme Court delivered yesterday in the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 which found the Bill to be unconstitutional in part.

The study estimated the cost at €12 million capital and €4 million revenue for a single helicopter. The number of missions to be performed was estimated at 400 to 600 annually. Interhospital air ambulance services are provided by the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard, subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. Most patient transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance.My Department and the Department of Defence are finalising a service level agreement to formalise arrangements for the future provision of an air ambulance service by the Aer Corps. A significant helicopter fleet replacement programme has recently been approved and is being put in place for the Air Corps. Each of the new helicopters will have a specific air ambulance capability. The new fleet will also have a far greater flying capacity than is available. In addition, my Department has reached agreement with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that the Irish Coast Guard will continue to provide air ambulance services on the same basis as heretofore.My Department is advised that plans are being developed within the private sector for the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service, primarily in an interhospital transfer role and with a view to the service becoming operational at an early date. My Department is continuing to monitor developments in this regard.

It involves a number of stages and includes an initial assessment, a considerable level of education-preparation work, including an exploration with prospective adoptive parents of the challenges and issues that are likely to arise when undertaking adoption, and a home study assessment. The length of the assessment process can vary between applicants depending on the particular circumstances of each case.The length of time it takes to complete the necessary assessment and the allocation of resources within the Health Service Executive is a matter for the management of the executive.

Sunbeds are not medical devices and are not regulated under the medical devices directive. Existing consumer legislation sets standards for tanning equipment and requires appropriate warning notices to be displayed on the equipment. However, no medical procedure is involved in the use of sunbeds and their use does not have to be supervised by a medical practitioner.The General Product Safety Directive 2001/95/ EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 3 December 2001 came into force on 15 January 2004. This EU directive was transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 199 of 2004. These regulations are known as the European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations 2004 and came into effect on 4 May 2004.The general product safety directive puts the onus on producers to place only safe products on the market. Distributors are obliged to act with due care to help to ensure compliance, in particular by not supplying products which they know or should have presumed on the basis of the information in their possession, do not comply with the applicable safety requirements of the directive. The Director of Consumer Affairs has responsibility for the enforcement of the general product safety regulations.The advice from my Department is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by persons under 16 years of age, persons who burn easily or tan slowly or poorly, those taking drugs or using cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer, and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma.The health promotion unit of my Department works in partnership with the Irish Cancer Society to develop health promotion programmes with communities and workplaces and to undertake regular public information and awareness campaigns that focus on cancer prevention, risk prevention and early detection. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from sunbeds and sunlamps and the appropriate precautions is available from the Irish Cancer Society.

The senior area medical officer attached to the relevant local health board is responsible for both the medical assessment and the issue of the medical certificate.The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations, and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria, as set out above, is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate qualifies the holder for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax, or VRT, a repayment of value added tax, or VAT, on the purchase of the vehicle and a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.An interdepartmental review group was established to review the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme. The group's report examined all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria. The report was published on my Department's website in July 2004, and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. As agreed by the Government in June 2004, I will consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	332	As the Deputy will be aware, drug abuse is a national and not just a regional problem. The memorandum of understanding which was signed by both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance in January 1996 provides that the Customs and Excise service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into the State. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the customs and excise service continually reviews operational approaches and resources devoted to the prevention of illegal drug importation at ports and airports and along our coastline. As regards cocaine, I am advised that, in 2004, the Customs and Excise service seized 47 kg. of cocaine with a street value of €3.5 million.In June 2004, the Revenue deployed a new enforcement resource with the launch of the first customs vessel, the RCC Suirbhéir, to patrol our coastline in close co-operation with the navalservice. The vessel regularly takes part in operations along the south-east coast. The drugs watch programme, where customs work in partnership and on a confidential basis with coastal communities to raise awareness of drug smuggling and to gather intelligence, has also been revitalised.In addition, co-operation with other law enforcement agencies has been enhanced. Last year customs participated in 30 international operations, many of them resulting in the seizure of drugs and the arrest of those involved in their importation. A customs officer has been assigned to the Europol national unit since 2001, and the commissioners have recently decided to seek the nomination of a customs officer as liaison officer with Europol in The Hague.In the south east there are dedicated customs teams based in Waterford and Rosslare whose primary focus is the prevention of smuggling. During 2004 those teams were involved in 20 seizures of drugs, with a total street value of over €6 million, and those results are indicative of the major effort by Revenue authorities in the area.Customs management in the south east has increased manpower, modernised facilities and experimented with new operational tactics at key ports. Customs continue to have success in preventing imports of hard drugs.The Revenue will continue to play its part in co-operation with the Garda and other State agencies to combat drug smuggling and to support the national drugs strategy. I am advised by the Revenue that the question of resource deployment is kept under ongoing review.

At the same time the tax yield to the State has continued to rise owing to the extra economic activity accompanying that policy. In some cases, such as capital gains tax and corporation tax, the tax yield increased substantially after rates were cut. That extra tax revenue has been used, among other things, to reduce tax on the ordinary PAYE worker, remove low-income earners from the tax net altogether and fund the provision of increased public services.

The details of those two contracts are as follows.Q4 was engaged by my Department to provide project and event management advice and media support regarding the informal meeting of the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers of the EU in County Kildare on 2 to 4 April 2004 during the Irish Presidency of the EU. It is estimated that some €23,700 of the total cost of that contract related to the public relations aspect, that is, support in dealing with the national and international media attending the event. The contract has now concluded.In respect of the public relations element of the contract, Q4 reported to and took instruction from the press officer of my Department.Documentation supplied by Q4 to my Department indicated that a partner in Q4 who led the consultancy was formerly employed as general secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party. The documentation also indicated that Q4 has had a wide range of consultancy contracts in both the private and public sectors. The documentation did not indicate whether Q4 may have had any previous contracts, commitments or employment with either of the Government parties.The second contract is a contract for general marketing of the E-tenders website, which includes advertising and public relations. It is with a consortium comprising The Media Group, Ogilvy & Mather and Elucidate. The contract was signed in October 2004 for a period of one year, and the estimated cost of the public relations element in it is €38,500. It is renewable for up to one further year.The consortium reports to the principal officer of the national public procurement policy unit of my Department.Documentation held by my Department concerning that contract does not indicate any previous contracts, commitments or employment with either of the Government parties by the consortium or its component parts.Apart from those two contracts placed by my Department, two others are relevant to the Deputy's question. The NDP-CSF information unit — which operates under the aegis of my Department and is part-funded by the EU — awarded one public relations contract in the period since 1 January 2002. The objective of the contract is to raise awareness and increase understanding of the national development plan and the Community Support Framework 2000-2006, as there is a legal requirement on member states to raise public awareness of the role of the EU structural funds. The contract was awarded to Curtin Communications, now known as Grayling Communications, in August 2003 to cover the period from September 2003 to September 2005. The value of the contract was €306,000.The contract is managed by the NDP-CSF information officer, to whom the contractors report.Documentation held by my Department concerning that contract does not indicate any previous contracts, commitments or employment with either of the Government parties by Curtin Communications.All the officials to whom the contractors in the three contracts above report or reported are or were governed by the rules regarding civil servants and their involvement in politics.Finally, the Special EU Programmes Body, or SEUPB, awarded one public relations contract in the period mentioned by the Deputy. The SEUPB is one of six North-South implementation bodies set up under Strand II of the Good Friday Agreement and manages the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, or PEACE II, and the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA programme. Both of those programmes are funded with EU and national funding in both jurisdictions. The contract was awarded in March 2004 to Morrow Communications and is for public relations relating to the two programmes. There is an EU requirement on structural fund programmes to raise public awareness of the role of the EU in those programmes. The value of the contract is €115,000 and is for a period of one year. The contract is renewable for up to one further year.Morrow Communications reports to the corporate services director of the SEUPB. Documentation held by my Department and the SEUPB does not indicate that either the corporate services director of the SEUPB or Morrow Communications has had any previous contracts, commitments or employment with either of the Government parties.I should say that I am assured that all contracts mentioned in this reply were placed in accordance with public procurement procedures.While the Office of Public Works is not funded from my Department's Vote, my Department has asked that office to provide information in answer to this question direct to the Deputy.

The chief executive officer advises me that one fish kill was recorded in 2003 on each of the Griffeen, 3 April 2003, and River Ryewater, 15 September 2003, and that one fish kill was recorded in 2004 on the River Ryewater, 18 to 19 June 2004.While prosecutions might not have been possible in all cases, to date in at least one case amelioration damages have been obtained.

The collection of waste is generally handled by Ipodec in the Dublin area and by local arrangement in the Department's country offices.My Department has a comprehensive waste paper recycling programme in place whereby such paper is collected for recycling each month. That is carried out by DMG Services Limited. Cardboard is collected for recycling by Ipodec in two of the Department's Dublin offices. Also there is an arrangement in those offices for the collection of bottles and cans for recycling. Monthly collections of toner cartridges are made by Temple Street Children's Hospital for recycling purposes. All redundant IT equipment is handed over to companies who specialise in recycling electronic equipment. The items are disassembled, with components being reused or recycled as appropriate. There is not a standing contract in place for environmental disposal of IT equipment. Quotations are sought from recycling companies when a suitable quantity of material has accumulated.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The National Salmon Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1999 to assist and advise the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the conservation, management, protection and development of the national salmon resource and, in particular, in relation to the national wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations. In that context, the chairman of the commission is entitled to express his views independently of either the Minister or the Department.The Deputy should be aware that I recently stated quite openly and publicly that I believe the cost of buying out commercial salmon driftnet licences in Ireland could be as high as €75 million or more. This figure is based on buy-out proposals which were implemented in recent years in Northern Ireland and the north east of England, where the cost of buying out, not all, but up to 56 licence holders is understood to have cost some Stg£3.25 million.On this basis, the cost of a similar voluntary buy-out scheme in Ireland, if taken up in full by the drift net operators — 887 licences — would be in the region of €75 million. This figure would increase substantially if the draft nets — over 800 licences — were to be included. I am sure the Deputy will agree that buy-out proposals on this scale are not practical and we need to caution against excessive expectations about large amounts of compensation.The Government has consistently ruled out buy-out as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and instead promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective. Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buy-out nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase.As a result, I have no plans to introduce proposals to purchase commercial salmon fishing licences. As I have previously indicated to the House, I am prepared to keep the matter under review and would be open to any relevant proposals whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch might fund any compensation that might arise.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Under section 68 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, the issuing of permit charges for angling is an operational matter for the relevant regional fisheries board, in this instance the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board. This is not something in which I, as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, have any function. I am advised that all of the revenue generated by the regional fisheries boards from permit fees are retained by the boards and re-invested in the on-going management and development of fisheries in their region.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	342	It has not been possible to prepare a comprehensive response in the time available. To provide details of all transactions on all cards during the period in question requires the collation, transcription and checking of an enormous amount of data. Officials in the Department are currently investigating the optimal method of supplying the Deputy with the information requested, having regard to the inordinate amount of time involved in undertaking this exercise, the pressures on available resources within the Department and the format of records held by the credit card companies. As soon as the optimal method of provision has been determined, I will revert to the Deputy with the information requested.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	343	No public relation consultancies, contracts or procurements have been entered into by or on behalf of my Department in the past three years.

Policy in relation to immigration in this jurisdiction is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.There are a wide variety of circumstances in which a visitor to one jurisdiction within the common travel area may be required to transit the territory of the other. In certain cases there may be a visa requirement in both jurisdictions. This arises from the fact that the common travel area operates only for the benefit of Irish and British citizens.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The Department's records show that in 2004, 223,890 kg. of waste was produced, of which 12.23%, 27,390 kg. was recycled. No breakdown of either figure is available but the recycled portion comprised paper and an amount of aluminium cans. My Department does not produce significant amounts of hazardous or organic waste or of waste textiles, plastic or glass. It is the Department's policy to recycle electrical and electronic equipment but no figure is available in respect of the amount of such waste recycled in 2004. The removal of waste is paid for on a collection basis and the Department does not have any formal contracts for the disposal of waste.Recyclable waste produced by the Department's offices at Bishop's Square is included in the above figures. As the building is shared with several other tenants, the building management controls the disposal of other waste for the whole building and it is not in a position to provide detailed information on the volume of waste produced in the Department's offices for the period in question.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Ireland was one of the first countries to respond in the wake of the earthquake in Bam, Iran in December 2003. On 26 December 2003, the day the earthquake struck, the Government immediately pledged €1 million in funding for the humanitarian and recovery operations. Subsequently, assistance amounting to a total of €1.57 million was delivered; €500,000 of the pledge was channelled to the International Federation of the Red Cross-Red Crescent, IFRC; €500,000 was provided to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, which co-ordinated the UN response on the ground; and the remainder went to Concern and Trócaire. The Government's funding was utilised for food, temporary shelter, water, sanitation and the rehabilitation of schools.The Government is firmly of the view that the delivery of pledges of assistance in the aftermath of natural disasters and other major catastrophes should be a priority for all donors. We also believe that pledges should be delivered in a timely manner to assist in humanitarian operations, but also in order that the recovery and reconstruction plans can be implemented in a realistic timeframe.I am aware of recent reports in the media that pledges made in the aftermath of the Bam earthquake were not fully met. The United Nations appeal was for approximately €33 million and almost €18 million was delivered. While additional funding through NGOs and other international organisations was provided to Bam, it is highly likely that the delivery of Bam pledges fell far short of the reported €1 billion committed.Ireland has been strongly supportive of proposals to strengthen the monitoring of pledges made by international donors, including through the EU and UN systems. The post-tsunami action plan, adopted by EU Foreign Ministers at the recent General Affairs and External Relations Council, includes a commitment to improve the system of follow-up on financial commitments, as well as on the effective use of funds committed. It is through careful tracking of pledges and disbursements that we can get a true picture of how donors are delivering on their aid pledges. This information will make the process more transparent and will inevitably exert pressure on donors to make good on pledges.

However, not all Irish citizens who are so arrested or imprisoned avail of this right. In addition, the number of Irish prisoners abroad is constantly changing as some are released and others newly detained. For these reasons, it is not really possible to be fully precise about how many Irish citizens are imprisoned abroad, or to give a completely comprehensive breakdown by crime and country. However, the following table gives an overall picture.Some Irish prisoners abroad, who do not seek consular assistance from my Department, choose instead to avail of the counselling and welfare services provided by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, ICPO. As a result, the ICPO also has detailed information on the number and location of Irish prisoners abroad and this is reflected in the table set out below. However, like the Department, it would not claim to have a completely accurate picture for the reasons given above. I should add that the Department provides financial assistance to the ICPO to support its valuable work on behalf of Irish prisoners abroad and their families.The crimes for which Irish people abroad are in prison are very varied and range from minor to serious crimes such as drug offences and murder.NumberLocation1Arabian Gulf1Argentina3Australia1Bolivia2Brazil1Canada2Canary Islands1Cuba1Ecuador708Great Britain1France3Germany3Holland1Isle of Man1Japan1Panama2Peru3Spain1Thailand28United StatesTotal: 765

I have, however, asked that a breakdown of these costs be made available to the Deputy as quickly as possible.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	349	There was no expenditure on public relations in 2002 by the Department of Foreign Affairs.While no public relations consultants or companies were employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2003 and 2004, Red Dog Design Consultants were employed, following a tendering process, by Development Co-operation Ireland, a division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The company was paid €46,201.50 in 2003, €94,332.23 in 2004 and €6,231 so far in 2005 for work in respect of the design and printing of various information booklets and publications. The reason for the significant increase in 2004 was a large increase in the volume of publications and the development aspects of the EU Presidency.During 2004, Development Co-operation Ireland, following an open tender process, employed the Cork based company Real Event Solutions to design, organise and manage a primary school competition around the theme of international development and the millennium development goals. The competition aimed at every primary school in the country was launched on 25 January 2005. The competition has a public relations aspect aimed at increasing school participation in the competition, both at regional and national level. The public relations component of the project is being handled for Real Event Solutions by O'Leary PR & Marketing Limited. To date, Real Event Solutions has received €58,329.02 for its services. For both projects, the companies reported to the information officer in Development Co-operation Ireland.Red Dog Design was also employed by the Department, on behalf of the interdepartmental presidency administrative planning group, following a tender process, for work relating to the design and branding for the EU Presidency and the launch of the Presidency logo. The company was paid €43,461.37 in 2003 for this work. The same company was paid €23,466.74 in 2004 for a promotion campaign for the EU Presidency website. The greater part of this amount was for the purchasing of media advertising space in national newspapers and on local radio. During the course of its work, Red Dog received instructions from and reported to officials in the presidency planning unit of my Department. Both these projects were of a short-term nature and have been completed.The Department of Foreign Affairs has no knowledge if either of the companies referred to has had any contracts, commitments or employment with either of the Government parties.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	351	On 21 January 2005 the Government of Nepal ordered the closure of the offices of the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office, TRWO, and the Office of the Dalai Lama. The Nepalese authorities have explained that the two offices are not legally registered and are, therefore, in violation of Nepalese law. The apparent difficulty in this regard is that Tibetan refugees do not have the right to register institutions under Nepalese law. On the other hand, the offices have been informally accepted in Nepal since 1959, when the first refugees started coming from Tibet. They look after the welfare of around 20,000 Tibetan refugees and since 1990 the TRWO has also acted as an implementing partner for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.On 27 January, EU Heads of Mission in Kathmandu used a prearranged meeting with the State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Prakash Sharan Mahat, to convey their concern about this development. They made the point that the closure of the offices would be detrimental to the welfare of many thousands of Tibetans living in Nepal and could also reflect on Nepal's international reputation. They encouraged the Government to reverse its decision and to either allow the offices to remain open informally or change the law to allow them to be registered. In reply, the State Minister gave assurances that Nepalese policy towards Tibetan refugees had not changed, and that the closure would have no effect on the cultural, religious or welfare activities of Tibetans in Nepal. He added that it would be open to Tibetans to open a new welfare office, and to register this office in the name of a Tibetan with Nepalese nationality.As regards the situation in Nepal generally, the King has recently dismissed the Government and declared a state of emergency. As a result, EU Heads of Mission have been recalled to their capitals for consultations.

Collection and disposal of general waste from 23 Kildare Street is organised by the main tenant. Both Departments make common use of the same waste containers and there is no record kept of the volume of waste produced by each Department. The waste is categorised by general waste, cardboard and paper. There is a separate waste container for each of the three categories. The waste is not weighed but rather there is a flat-rate fee incurred each time the waste containers are emptied.My Department's premises at Frederick Building are shared with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Transport, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service, with the Department of Foreign Affairs being the main tenant. In addition the owners of the building, Jones Lang La Salle, also have offices in the building and it is they who arrange general waste collection and disposal on behalf on all the occupants in the building. At the moment there is no recycling of waste from Frederick Building. The waste generated by all the occupants in the building is placed together in the same container. Again, there is a flat-rate fee incurred each time the waste is collected. The waste is not weighed. My Department has been in contact with Jones Lang La Salle about introducing waste separation and recycling in Frederick Building and it is understood that it plans to do this over the next few weeks, which will allow for paper, cardboard and glass to be separated, stored separately for collection and ultimately recycled.Arrangement for disposal of electronic waste is dealt with directly by my Department. The waste is disposed of through NightTime Express in accordance with legislative requirements. A flat rate fee is charged per item for disposal. The waste is not weighed.The National Museum has a contract with Ipodec for waste collection from its Kildare Street premises. A flat rate fee is charged per collection and the waste is not weighed. There is waste separation in place for paper, which is collected by Sunflower Recycling. The Office of Public Works collects waste from the National Museum premises at Collins Barracks. There is waste separation in place for paper to allow for recycling. The waste is not weighed.Waste from the National Museum of Country Life, Turlough Park, Castlebar, County Mayo, is collected by McGrath Waste. There is waste separation in place for paper to allow for recycling. There is a flat fee charged per collection and the waste is not weighed.Waste from the National Library, Kildare Street, is collected by Dublin City Council. Again, there is waste separation in place for paper to allow for recycling. The cost for disposal is per collection. The waste is not weighed.Waste from the National Archives, Bishop Street, Dublin 8, is collected on a weekly basis by Dublin City Council. There is a waste separation option for paper and cans. The National Archives are charged for waste collection on a six-monthly basis. The waste is not weighed.

The Asgard, by arrangement with the National Museum of Ireland, is in safekeeping at John’s Road, Inchicore, under the care of the Office of Public Works.The National Museum of Ireland requested the OPW to examine the feasibility of developing a permanent exhibition facility for the  Asgard within the NMI Collins Barracks complex. The OPW has identified a number of possible locations within Collins Barracks and has written to the National Museum seeking detailed information regarding such matters as exact dimensions, conservation requirements, display criteria and interpretation. A response to this request is awaited from the National Museum. On receipt of full information, a feasibility report can be finalised by June of this year. Further progress in respect of the conservation of the vessel and putting it on public view will depend on resources available to my Department.

The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. Subject to final confirmation, a total of 43 applications were received from County Kildare. All applications received before the closing date are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.The principal channel for State support for the arts is via the Arts Council, which is statutorily independent on how it disburses its funds.

The certainty that exists regarding the future of the scheme is also very important, as quite long planning horizons apply to major international film productions. Not alone can producers be sure that the section 481 scheme is secure for at least several years to come, but the way in which our scheme operates, and what its requirements are already very familiar to producers both in Ireland and abroad.I have just returned from a visit to the United States, during which I met the major film studios to make the case for choosing Ireland as a place to make films. While in the US, I also floated the idea of basing a representative in Los Angeles to effectively communicate what Ireland can offer as a filming location. This can obviously be better achieved with the type of relationships that can be built up through a permanent presence on the ground where decisions are made.The Irish Film Board has responsibility for promoting film making in Ireland, and for marketing Ireland as a filming location. The board has received funding for 2005 that is an increase of over 20% on what was provided in 2004.

As regards the acquisition of a site, the Office of Public Works has identified a local authority site in Killarney for which to develop offices for the Department. The projects division of OPW has decided on a design and build option. OPW sought and received submissions from interested developers throughout the country as regards this option and the next step will involve OPW in the assessment of the submissions. The objective is to seek tenders for the building contract in mid-year and for the building work to commence later in 2005.As regards staffing matters, I understand that a transfer protocol has been agreed centrally by the decentralisation unit in the Department of Finance. This will clear the way to commence the transfer to my Department of staff who have applied for decentralisation to Killarney. I expect that the timeframe set for the Department to be operating effectively and efficiently from the decentralised office will be met.

The roof of the 50m pool and diving pool and the roof of the leisure water area were both damaged, and in addition, damage occurred to lights and fittings around the complex. This has resulted in the National Aquatic Centre being closed to the public while the building was being made safe, the damage assessed and repairs undertaken. In the interests of public safety the National Aquatic Centre will remain closed to the public while the major repair work is ongoing. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, is currently consulting various parties to establish the cost of repair work and the technical specification of the remedial works required.

The implementation group set up to drive forward the New Horizons agenda, in its first progress report of September last, identified ten priority actions which it considered vital to sustaining future growth. Of these, the restoration of Ireland's competitive edge remains the most important and the most challenging. Another priority identified in the report, and a particular priority for myself and the Government, is the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin. As set out in replies to separate questions on this issue, I expect to see continued progress on this project in 2005.Bolstered by an unprecedented level of Exchequer investment in tourism services of over €123 million, representing an 8% increase on 2004, both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland, for their part, have developed a comprehensive set of plans and programmes aimed at assisting the industry to respond to the key challenges ahead and at ensuring its continued development in 2005.One of Tourism Ireland's main priorities for 2005 will be to reinforce Ireland's marketing position in the British market. Without volume growth from Britain, the ambitious targets set in the New Horizons report will be difficult to achieve. Another key challenge for tourism, the growing disparity in the performance of the regions, will be addressed by both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland with a number of innovative approaches to heighten the regional impact of Ireland's marketing activities, both internationally and at home.New air services, including from the United States and into Shannon from Europe, will be promoted in order to optimise their inbound tourism potential. Strategic investment in capital projects in under-performing areas through the tourism product development scheme will continue in an effort to match the quality of the product available on the ground with more demanding consumer expectations. In order to further encourage the development of new projects under the scheme, I requested Fáilte Ireland last year to invite further investment proposals for financial assistance under the scheme's special interest pursuits category. With an indicative grant fund of €12 million to be allocated between the Border midlands and western, BMW, and southern and eastern regions, I look forward to seeing increased investment in pursuits such as equestrian, cycling, walking, gardens, specialist outdoor activities, water-based tourism and health tourism.At enterprise level, a range of new initiatives has been developed to address competitiveness including a new on-line facility to help individual enterprises benchmark their financial performance against similar enterprises and to highlight areas for improvement.

These applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed. At this point, I could not say how many allocations will be made.My Department operates the ACCESS scheme which provides funding for the capital development of arts and cultural facilities, galleries, museums, etc., around the country.

Subsequently, in the context of its November 2004 report on the arms trade involving Sudan, Amnesty International referred to documentation, described as an end-use certificate, purporting to show that the Irish company was authorised to negotiate for the sale of military equipment to the Sudanese defence forces.My Department investigated the allegations in relation to the role of the Irish company. In this regard, it was established that the company was dormant and had not traded since its establishment in 1990. Moreover, the beneficial owner of the Irish company strongly denied any involvement, either by himself or his company, in the alleged arms deal. On the basis of the investigation, no evidence emerged of any involvement in illegal brokering activities by the Irish company.An EU arms embargo against Sudan is already in place. Council Common Position 2004/31/CFSP of 9 January, 2004 provides for an arms embargo including a ban on technical and financial assistance to military activities, with exemptions for humanitarian and de-mining equipment.The Government has recently approved the drafting of new legislation in the area of export controls for military goods. The proposed new legislation, as recommended by the Forfás review, provides for the introduction of new controls on arms brokering and on the provision of certain types of technical assistance. Existing legislation will be also updated to provide, inter alia, for increased penalties for non-compliance with export control legislation and for the statutory right for the inspection and audit of companies that export military goods. The introduction of this new legislation will ensure that Ireland meets its EU and international obligations in full and equally ensures that its procedures are not overly restrictive as to make Ireland an unattractive location by international standards for mobile activity in legitimate industries.

Information on other categories requested by the Deputy is not available as such waste is not separated and weighed at present. Arrangements are being made for the introduction of a comprehensive waste management system that will result in the recycling of waste produced, to the maximum extent possible, in each of the relevant categories to which the Deputy refers. In July 2004 a 12 month pilot waste management project was initiated in the Department's six city-centre Dublin headquarter buildings, where 1,300 people are employed. A waste contractor has been employed to collect all waste streams from these offices, including general and wet waste as well as electronic and hazardous waste, on request. This new arrangement is expected to increase significantly the volume and type of waste that will be recycled. Establishing details in this regard will form part of a comprehensive review of the pilot project, which will get underway shortly. Following the review it is the intention to extend the arrangements to other Departmental offices around the country.

The changeover process involved the provision of more than 58,000 traffic signs depicting the application of speed limits across the country. The new metric traffic signs provided prior to 20 January indicate the locations at which the default speed limits provided for in the 2004 Act apply or the locations at which special speed limits had been applied by county and city councils in lieu of default speed limits. The determination of what speed limit should apply at particular locations in lieu of a default speed limit is a matter for the elected members of city and county councils. The power to apply special speed limits has been vested in the elected members since the passing of the Road Traffic Act 1994.Section 9 of the 2004 Act sets out a new process for the making of speed limit by-laws by the elected members of county and city councils. The range of options available to county and city councils in relation to the deployment of special speed limits has been expanded from previous legislation. It also provides that the Minister for Transport may issue guidelines relating to the making of special speed limit by-laws.With the commencement of the provisions in the Road Traffic Act 2004 on speed limits from 20 January 2005 and the completion of the programme for the provision of the traffic signs necessary to support the actual changeover, county and city councils are now free to embark on the process of making new special speed limit by-laws. The deployment of the new 30 km/h and the 120 km/h special speed limit may only be pursued in accordance with provisions in guidelines which I am empowered to issue under section 9.Draft guidelines are being prepared and my Department is engaged in a consultation process with county and city councils. The process will be completed shortly at which point I will issue the statutory guidelines to local authorities on a formal basis. Within a matter of weeks, local authorities will be in a position to pursue the full range of initiatives available through special speed limit by-laws.

The NCTS is also required to achieve a composite customer satisfaction rating of at least 80% in annual customer satisfaction surveys. In addition, the NCTS has agreed to an independent appeals system to enhance transparency and provide additional assurances about customer service and the integrity of the test. The system has been operational in the greater Dublin area on a pilot basis for some months. The independent assessment of appeals is carried out by the Automobile Association and five appeals have been made to date. It is a matter for NCTS customers to initiate the process. However, a customer must have exhausted the internal complaints and appeals procedure operated by NCTS before making an appeal to the Automobile Association.The system will be implemented for NCT test centres throughout the country. Implementation is on a non-statutory basis in the first instance and will be kept under regular review as to its operations and effectiveness. As part of the pilot stage an appeal was not subject to a fee. However, because of the potential costs of a countrywide system, customers who invoke the independent appeals system will be required to pay to the Automobile Association an appeal fee equivalent to the fee for a first test. Where the appeal is granted, the fee will be refunded to the appellant.

With regard to the plan for the south east RDTF, I understand that it is due to be submitted to the national drugs strategy team for consideration by the end of this month.The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for each RDTF to prioritise proposals in their plans based on identified local needs. If cocaine is an emerging issue for the south east region, I would expect that proposals to address this issue will be included in their forthcoming plan.Once the regional plans have been assessed by the team, I will be making recommendations to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion for approval so that the various programmes and initiatives can be rolled out as early as possible in 2005.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	389	In the EU there is legislation requiring that all our meat products, for export, within the EU or to third countries must be produced in approved establishments supervised by official veterinarians. Under EU harmonised rules the import of meat into the European Union may only take place from third countries where similar rules apply, that is, from establishments in those countries which are approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's food and veterinary office. On import into the EU these products must be presented at approved border inspection posts where they are subject to the checks laid down in these harmonised rules to ensure compliance with EU standards in respect of animal and public health. They must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export. Having passed these controls, the meat is regarded as being in free circulation within the EU.As regards to the specific countries mentioned by the Deputy, Brazil is approved to export only bovine and poultry meats to the EU. It is not approved to export porcine meats. Chile is approved to export all of these three types of meats to the EU.The Central Statistics Office is responsible for the collection of statistics in relation to imports of meat and meat preparations. The following tables have been prepared from data supplied by that office and include the figures requested by the Deputy.The information available for imports from member states of the European Union does not differentiate between imports originating in the EU country and those originating from third countries that may already be in free circulation within the community.Under the single market there is free circulation of goods within the EU but there are uniform EU-wide controls on the production and trade in meat and meat products such as pigmeat. Under community law it is a requirement that the meat has been sourced from an approved establishment, whether that is a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store. It must also be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or health certificate that bears the identity of the establishment from which it has been despatched.The volume of pig-meat imported into the EU from non-EU countries is negligible. An estimated 43,000 tonnes were imported into the EU in 2004 whereas EU production was over 21 million tonnes. Very little, if any, third country pigmeat is imported into Ireland.The importance to the consumer of being in a position to make food consumption choices which best suit their circumstances and preferences is a vital element in today's market. An appropriate labelling system is a key element in this respect. The primacy of the consumer was recognised with the appointment in my Department of the consumer liaison panel, established in 2002. Acting on a recommendation from that panel, the food labelling group was also established in June 2002. That group reported in December of that year with a number of recommendations.One of these recommendations was that information on the origin of fresh, chilled and frozen sheep meat, pig meat and poultry meat sold in retail outlets, pre-packaged or otherwise, should be declared.I am happy to report that at the beginning of 2004, two regulations in relation to the labelling of poultry meat were introduced. The first of these regulations requires poultry meat, loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultry meat, that is, non-prepackaged, to be provided to the consumer.In the beef sector, the EU beef labelling regulations which were introduced in 2000 require operators involved in the marketing of beef to label their product with a reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located; the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located; and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived.For the purpose of these regulations, marketing means all aspects of beef production and marketing up to and including retail sale. These labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to the marketing of beef within the community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the community or in a third country. Where beef is imported in to the community from a third country and not all the above details are available, that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as "Origin: non-EC", along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place.My Department and the Department of Health and Children are examining the legislative measures necessary to extend similar regulations to sheep meat and pig meat. Both Departments are also exploring the necessary measures for extending the requirement to indicate the origin of all meat in the food service sector.In relation to the tables, the following points should be noted. In certain cases the record of import may include the re-import of Irish products that were originally the subject of an export from this country. The information available for imports from member states of the European Union, EU, does not differentiate between imports originating in the EU country and those originating from third countries that may already be in free circulation within the community.

The extension of the opening hours at the station would only serve to confine more personnel to indoor administrative duties. It is the view of the Garda authorities that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoorpolice duties.In relation to Garda resources generally, I am, of course, very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of Laytown Garda station will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

In the case of the application referred to by the Deputy in this and his two previous parliamentary questions, a number of documents were not supplied with the initial applications, which contributed to the applications being refused on grounds of insufficient documentation and finances. The missing documentation included detailed payslips, banks statements, the applicant's divorce papers, and a letter of consent from the father of the children to their removal from their country of origin. At appeal stage, the initial refusal decision was upheld as, although additional documentation was supplied, there was no letter of consent from the father of the applicant's children, or an order by a judicial or administrative authority stating that such consent is not required.It is open to the applicant to make new visa applications accompanied by the relevant documents and these applications will be considered anew.

The Deputy will be aware that planning issues have a significant influence on the market value of land. I am satisfied that the purchase of the land at Thornton for the new prison complex represents good value for the taxpayer.

In addition, the Garda operates a number of special Garda projects in the region, through funding received from my Department. The purpose of these projects is to address a number of the needs of young people at risk of becoming engaged in criminal activity, including substance misuse.The Government established ten regional drugs task forces in 2002 based on the old health board areas to ensure the development of a co-ordinated and integrated approach is in place to tackle the drugs problem. The south eastern regional drug task force's area of remit includes the counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford and Tipperary South Riding. The Garda is represented on this group.Since their establishment, the task forces, including the south eastern regional drug task force, have been involved in a process of mapping out the nature and extent of drug misuse in their regions and they are developing action plans to tackle the problem which will be presented to Government during 2005. Issues of emerging cocaine use in the region and measures to address this will be considered in this context.Other resources available to the south eastern region to address substance usage, including cocaine, include dedicated divisional drugs units, community gardaí and juvenile liaison officers. These resources are supported by the general Garda resources operating within the region as well as support from national units, including the Garda national drugs unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the national bureau of criminal investigation.With regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard.

A worker employed under the employment permit scheme may be joined by their spouse and minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds.When assessing applications of this type, the visa officer will consider, among other factors, whether the salary of the worker comes within the ambit of qualifying for payment from public funds. In this regard, the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement payment, FIS, are used as a guideline. The criteria, which may change from time to time, are available on that Department's website, www.welfare.ie/publications/sw22.html. If the worker’s income, as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60, qualifies for FIS payments, the application for a visa is generally refused. In this case, the income, as evidenced by the payslips supplied, was significantly less than the relevant benchmark amount.

It is a long established practice that the positions of full-time chaplains in the Irish Prison Service have been filled on the nomination of the local bishop. The bishop writes to the Minister nominating a person to the position of chaplain in the Irish Prison Service. It has always been the practice for the Minister to accept the nomination of the local bishop. Similarly, if the bishop wishes to transfer a chaplain to another chaplaincy position or to a position outside of the Irish Prison Service it has always been the Minister's practice to accede to the bishop's deployment arrangements. It is my intention to continue this practice and this is reflected in the terms of the new contract for full-time Catholic chaplains, which has been agreed with the co-ordinating chaplains group nominated by the Irish Episcopal Conference as the chaplains representative group and which was circulated to the full-time chaplains in November 2004.The salient points of the contract are a substantially increased level of salary, viz: €48,058 — €49,403 — €50,763 — €52,132 — €53,587, max. — €54,948, LSI, at 1 December 2004. Other benefits include sick leave entitlements that apply to unestablished civil servants, that is, full pay during properly certified sick absence may be allowed up to a maximum of six months in one year and half pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of 12 months' sick leave in any period of four years or less and that the terms of the non-contributory scheme for non-established State employees and of the spouses and children's contributory scheme for non-established employees will apply. Annual leave arrangements in line with standard Civil Service practices will also apply. A personalised contract was forwarded to the chaplain on 26 November 2004 and a letter clarifying the salary issued to him on 25 January 2005. The signed contract has not been returned to the Irish Prison Service. The person referred to was appointed by my predecessor as a chaplain on the nomination of his bishop on 1 September 1998. The bishop intends to redeploy him to other duties in the diocese in July 2005.

Expenditure incurred on the credit cards is accounted for under various subheads on the Justice Vote and cannot be separately identified.

The future position in regard to initiatives aimed at addressing educational disadvantage at primary level is being considered in the context of this review, the outcome of which I hope to announce shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	413	An application has been received from the school to which the Deputy refers towards the cost of renting and renovating the premises which it currently occupies. This application is under consideration in the school planning section of my Department. A decision will be taken in the matter as quickly as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Under the terms of my Department's maintenance grants schemes, grant assistance is available to eligible students attending approved third level courses in approved institutions. An approved course for the purpose of the schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.In order to qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must, of course, satisfy the prescribed conditions of the schemes, including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Students from this State who are attending undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for maintenance grants in respect of approved courses at higher national diploma level or higher, which are pursued in colleges approved for the purpose of the schemes.Under the terms of the schemes, grants are not available in respect of tuition fees paid at undergraduate level in Northern Ireland. However, all EU students, including students from this State, are eligible for grant assistance towards the cost of tuition fees from the education and library boards in Northern Ireland, subject to the same conditions as apply to students who have been resident in Northern Ireland. Students pursuing approved postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for assistance under the terms of the schemes in respect of maintenance grants and, also, grants in respect of the cost of their tuition fees, subject to a maximum fee limit, which is currently €5,028.Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of undergraduate tuition fees paid for: approved full or part-time undergraduate courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges and universities in the State and any other EU member state; full or part-time undergraduate courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State; full or part-time undergraduate courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in non-EU countries. Tax relief is also available for postgraduate tuition fees paid for: approved full or part-time postgraduate courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges and universities in the State and any other EU member state and in non-EU countries. This tax relief applies at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in regard to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	415	Retirement by age 65 is a standard feature of public service pension schemes and usually, as in the case of established civil servants, involves retirement on the public servants 65th birthday. Special provisions applicable to teachers allow service to continue until the end of the school year in which age 65 is attained.The standard retirement age of 65 was recently addressed in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. The Act, which is in effect since 1 April 2004, abolishes the compulsory retirement age of 65 in the case of most new entrants to the public service, including teachers. The Act defines a new entrant as a person commencing employment in the public service on or after 1 April 2004 or a person resuming employment in the public service, after a break exceeding 26 weeks, on or after 1 April 2004. Since the person referred to by the Deputy is not a new entrant to teaching, I confirm that she will be required to retire at the end of the current school year as she will by then have reached age 65.

Acquisition of the site is at conveyancing stage. The school is expected to commence operation next September and the planning section of my Department is currently liaising with the chairperson of the board of management with view to procuring temporary accommodation to facilitate its commencement plans.

A letter outlining proposals regarding the establishment of a unit for pupils with Asperger's syndrome has recently issued to a post-primary school in that area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The case referred to by the Deputy has been reviewed by my Department. Arising from the review, my Department's position remains that satisfactory facilities exist within the State to meet the person's educational needs. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to make funding available for the person in question towards an educational placement abroad.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Following a review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, of the three technological subjects at leaving certificate level four syllabi have been submitted to my Department for consideration. These are engineering technology, formerly engineering; architectural technology, formerly construction studies; design and communication graphics, formerly technical drawing; and technology, no equivalent leaving certificate subject currently in existence.This was followed by further advice and analysis on implementation issues relating to in-service provision and facilities at school level which was forwarded to my Department last year. It is the Department's intention to progress the implementation of the revised syllabi as soon as possible. However, the recommendations call for a major investment in terms of infrastructure and staff development and it will be important that implementation is underpinned by the full level of supports necessary for schools to adopt the new programmes. Funding is not available in the current year to make significant progress on implementation.However, my Department is currently developing proposals to secure a commitment to the necessary multi-annual funding package which will enable the revised syllabi to be implemented at the earliest possible date. This is crucial in order to establish specific target dates for the introduction of the syllabi.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.The Deputy should note that significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the giving children an even break and breaking the cycle programmes, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class. In line with the programme for Government commitment, class sizes for the under-nines will continue to be reduced further.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I can confirm to the Deputy that the school to which he refers has submitted an application for grant aid under the summer works scheme, SWS, for roof repairs and mechanical works. All SWS applications are currently being assessed in the school planning section of my Department. I intend to publish the list of successful applicants shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Information in the detail requested is not available in the Department but will be compiled and forwarded to the Deputy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and three mainstream class teachers, based on the enrolment of 107 pupils on 30 September 2003. The school also has a resource post and the services of two shared learning support posts.According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 110 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule which is expected to be notified to boards in February or March 2005.As outlined in primary circular 19/02, an independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on the staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. Appeals in respect of staffing for the 2005-06 school year must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Language development is a central element of the revised primary curriculum. Although the focus is on English and Irish, a number of primary schools also offer foreign languages. My Department launched a pilot project for modern languages in primary schools in September 1998. The aims of the pilot project included the development of communication skills in four target languages which are French, German, Spanish and Italian, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in schools.To achieve these aims in the project schools the teaching of a modern European language to pupils in fifth and sixth classes was introduced. Currently, 394 schools are participating in the initiative at primary level. I have no plans at present to introduce Chinese at primary level. However, my Department is working closely with language experts from the Council of Europe to facilitate the analysis of language practice at primary and post-primary level, with a view to the formulation of an integrated language policy. This analysis will include the development of criteria for decision-making on issues such as the inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum. This will complement ongoing work by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which is engaged in reviewing languages in the post-primary curriculum and the feasibility of expanding provision at primary level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The Heads of State and Government, in their discussions in Barcelona in March 2002, reaffirmed the important role of education and training in developing a dynamic, efficient and inclusive Europe. In their conclusions they paid particular attention to, inter alia, the mastery of basic skills, including proficiency in foreign languages.The issue of basic skills has been addressed in the White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life, published by my Department in 2000, which set out a range of areas requiring investment and development and identified the development of a national adult literacy strategy as the top priority in adult education.The target adopted for the national anti-poverty strategy is "to reduce the proportion of the population aged 16-64 with restricted literacy to below 10-20% by 2007, restricted literacy being defined as falling below 200-225 on the international adult literacy survey scale or equivalent." My Department also has a target to provide adult literacy teaching to 113,000 adults over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.Key developments in support of the expansion of programmes and the enhancement of supports for learners on these programmes include a significant increase in investment in adult literacy services, from approximately €1 million in 1997 to more than €19 million in 2004.Regarding foreign language learning, the Barcelona European Council called for the teaching of at least two foreign languages from an early age. Increasingly, English is becoming the first foreign language taught, often as a compulsory subject, in other European countries. In Ireland, we have an advantage in having English as an official language and as the mother tongue of the majority of our students. However, this fact can also be a disincentive to the study of foreign languages, just as in other European countries it is often a challenge to persuade parents and students that it is worth learning foreign languages other than English.In Ireland, all our students learn Irish, usually as their second language. The experience of learning any second language is hugely beneficial to students in that it develops their awareness of how languages work and builds confidence in their own ability to learn other languages. The great majority of our students leave school with a knowledge of two languages besides their mother tongue, usually Irish and a modern foreign language.My Department has taken steps to introduce the teaching of foreign languages in primary school on a pilot basis and to diversify the range of languages on offer in second level schools. The modern languages in primary school initiative and the post-primary languages initiative both represent considerable commitment to the teaching of languages other than our two official languages and both initiatives have been successful in promoting their aims.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	426	In the interest of rational arrangements for the purposes of educational provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre. These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. The catchment boundaries were determined following consultation with local educational interests and the intention was that certain primary schools would feed exclusively into each post primary centre. A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two or more centres. My Department provides resources to meet the educational needs of an area on this basis.The prioritisation system used by my Department for large scale building works classifies projects by reference to a range of well established and well-defined categories. Within these categories, projects are assigned to an appropriate band of priority. There are four such bands, with band one being the highest priority and band four being the lowest. The criteria used to decide the band ratings were revised and published early last year following consultation with the education partners. When shaping a programme those projects that command the highest priority banding within their respective categories are considered for inclusion.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department considered an application for resource teaching hours for the person in question. The school was advised on 4 February 2005 that the pupil does not qualify for resource teaching support as the application did not meet the criteria for such support.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The information that the Deputy has sought is as follows. The total expenditure in respect of the three credit cards issued for departmental use for the said period was €27,511.08. The transactions covered by this expenditure were subsistence and hospitality expenses associated with official duties and the purchase of IT equipment and services. Of the total amount in excess of 62% was spent on IT related items.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	429	My Department has had two contracts with public relations consultants within the past three years. In the year to June 2002, an amount of €32,743.65 was paid to Dennehy Associates for general public relations advice and services. Reporting in respect of this contract was to the then Secretary General of my Department.The second contract was with Carr Communications and was placed late in 2003. A total amount of €114,574.31 was paid by my Department in 2004 in connection with this. The contract was for assistance and advice on publicising the your education system national process of public consultation and for ground support in the running of the public meetings. Carr Communications received instructions from and reported to a steering group in my Department charged with overseeing the YES process.My Department will make enquiries of the bodies under its aegis in connection with this question and provide the information directly to the Deputy. My Department has no information on any contracts, commitments or employment that these consultants have or have had with any third parties, including the Government parties.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	430	My Department's special education section has no record of receiving an application for special educational needs supports from the school in question. The National Council for Special Education has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. The council's responsibilities include deciding on applications for resource teaching support in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level. Since 1 January 2005, all applications for such supports are made by schools to the local special educational needs organiser. It is open to the school concerned to complete an application form and submit it to the special educational needs organiser. The provision of therapies is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64(1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she-he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases, appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.

Sweeney Communications Limited was paid €12,235, less withholding tax, in June 2002. No other payment was made to the company in question either before or since that date.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	435	In response to the reduced availability of traditional disposal and re-use routes for tyres and to promote recycling of this waste stream, my Department has had discussions with the Irish Tyre Industry Association with a view to establishing a producer responsibility initiative for this waste stream. This involves developing agreed detailed mechanisms for the operation of the take back of waste tyres, including how such arrangements will be funded in accordance with the principles of producer responsibility. These discussions are continuing with the intention of concluding the necessary arrangements for such an initiative later this year. Any consideration as to the introduction of any levy, or of its amount or form, would be premature prior to any producer responsibility initiative being agreed.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	436	General purpose grants to local authorities from the local government fund are based partly on a needs and resources assessment, which is designed to respond over time to fluctuations in income and expenditure. Local authorities receive income from a range of sources, including rates, charges for goods and services, specific State grants and general purpose grants from the local government fund. The 2005 general purpose grant allocation for Carlow County Council is €10,678,407, an increase of €950,362, or almost 10%, over the corresponding figure for 2004.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	437	In accordance with its environmental policy statement, my Department is fully committed to the effective management of waste including prevention, reduction and recycling. This is a critical element of our ongoing accreditation to ISO 14001:1996 which we achieved for our headquarters offices in 2003. We are working towards achieving this certification for all our offices and in the meantime a number of objectives guide our waste management activities across the Department including to reduce the quantity of consumable resources used by the Department, to identify, maintain and improve recycling schemes for waste materials and to ensure that non-recyclable waste arising on site is disposed of as safely as possible.A contract is in place for the collection and recycling of paper and cardboard packaging from my Department's main offices. The Department also engages, as required, the services of contractors, who specialise in recycling electrical and electronic equipment. Arrangements are in place in my Department's headquarters under which cans and plastic are collected and recycled by Dublin City Council. There are also arrangements in place for recycling glass and for the safe disposal of batteries. I am having similar arrangements put in place in other offices of my Department. The detailed information sought about the weight of various categories of waste produced by my Department is not available.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I assume that the question refers to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs, which may be present in transformers. A management plan for PCBs was published by the Environmental Protection Agency in August 2002, which outlines the strategy to be adopted in the managing and disposal of PCBs and PCB-contaminated equipment.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-17 00:00:00	Prelude	439	My Department actively promotes the conservation of fuel and energy through part L of the national building regulations and the related technical guidance document L. Progressively higher thermal performance and insulation standards introduced under part L since 1992 have significantly reduced the energy required, from all sources, to heat space and water in buildings. For example, it is estimated that the increased part L standards for dwellings, which came into effect on 1 January 2003, will reduce domestic heating requirements by 23% to 33% depending on the type of building; and will, by 2012, reduce CO2 emissions from dwellings by 300,000 tonnes per annum. This delivers on a commitment made in the national climate change strategy in October 2000.I understand that grants are available for demonstration projects of groups of buildings incorporating renewable energy including solar energy from Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, under the House of Tomorrow research, development and demonstration programme. The main focus of this programme is stimulating widespread uptake of superior sustainable energy planning, design, specification and construction practices. SEI comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey.My Department and local authorities are also taking a number of measures to encourage the voluntary use of renewable energy, including solar panels, in buildings. First, my Department's guidelines on the design of social housing, which were issued to local authorities in 1999, specifically advise that designers may also wish to consider the possibility of utilising solar panels to provide a proportion of water and space heating, where economic and practicable. A number of pilot projects have been undertaken by local housing authorities under the social housing programme in order to promote environmentally sustainable housing, including the use of solar energy. Relevant pilot projects include: Tallaght — Brookview — scheme; Tralee — Rathass — scheme, and Navan — Windtown — scheme. I understand that Wexford County Council is installing solar panels in a new 28 unit social housing scheme now under construction at Oilgate; and that SEI has allocated a grant of €140,000 in respect of these installations. Cork City Council has also specified solar panels in a number of dwellings covered by the The Glen regeneration project, phase 1, due to be completed in March 2005.Second, my Department sponsors the sustainable building award, as part of the annual Irish architecture awards of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, RIAI. The criteria for this award include use of passive or active solar heating systems.
