I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputies Joe Higgins and Boyle and ask them to state the matter.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of crucial public importance, namely, the report in The Irish Times today that a Forfás study has found this State to be the second most expensive in the European Union, the need for this report to be published in full forthwith, the implications of its findings for the living standards of working people and employment in tourism and related sectors and to allow a full debate on the matter.

Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 21 and 22, motions re Council decisions, agreed to?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	8	No, sir. Yesterday this House discussed the forthcoming second referendum on the Treaty of Nice. In the context of that debate, we raised questions concerning the role of the  Oireachtas, representing the citizens of this State, in terms of the scrutiny of legislation emanating from Council decisions. These matters arise from the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam and, in effect, the House is being asked to rubber stamp them. Had the House been sitting for some time, there would be committees to which these matters would normally be referred. However, the committees are not yet constituted because the Seanad elections are not completed.We are not prepared to accept this rubber stamp device in the House today. It will further alienate the sense people have of the job we have been elected to do – to scrutinise legislation. One of the proposals – not the first matter the Taoiseach has put before us – relates to issues of such intimacy as matrimonial relations and parental responsibility. One could have a situation where citizens could find themselves subject to laws which were never effectively scrutinised and passed through this House. It is the wrong  way for this new Government to do its business and, frankly, I am appalled that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing forward these measures, having regard to his much vaunted concerns and reservations about the way the European Union is evolving. We are opposed to taking these matters today.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Tomorrow, the House will set up the Select Committee on European Affairs to deal with other matters. In relation to these particular matters, there is a time limit of the middle of August. It cannot be done any other way. That is the reason for doing it this way.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I put it to the Taoiseach that one matter was referred to us in May and the other on 7 June. It is simply not the way to do business. The Government may have an overall majority, but it is not an elected dictatorship. We are not prepared to accept this procedure.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22a, motion re Council regulation agreed to?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	12	This matter was not signified to us last Friday when the draft schedule was circulated. The procedure adopted by the Government is totally unacceptable, notwithstanding the fact that it may have been adopted by previous Administrations. The 18th amendment of the Constitution which ratified the Amsterdam treaty made specific provision for the Oireachtas to properly scrutinise measures such as the one before us and while I will not divide the House on this occasion, I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to have regard for the absolute necessity to change practice in relation to this matter.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I also wish to register my concern at the way this matter has been placed on the Order Paper. Not only was it not signalled in the schedule as circularised at the end of last week, it was also not referred to at all in the discussed content of the Order for Business for this week at the Whips meeting last week. There was no prior notice. The document laid before the Oireachtas on 7 June is a very complex legal one which requires careful scrutiny. We only received notice yesterday that it was coming before the House. This is a very imperfect way of doing business and I wish to record the objection of the Sinn Féin Party to what I regard as wilfully introducing matter on which Members do not have the proper opportunity to prepare.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Like other speakers, I wish to point out the unacceptability of the production of a revised Order of Business. We did not have any forewarning last weekend. While I know these are technical proposals, I would have thought the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would set a new standard in regard to notifying the Opposition in regard to the proposals for business.Another practice seems to have been introduced in the new Dáil, that of allowing one Minister take all matters on the Adjournment. This is a practice which is totally unacceptable and without precedent.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	15	That does not arise at this point in time.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	16	But it does affect the order of business in a meaningful way. I am setting down a marker now. We do not expect that practice in the future.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	17	On behalf of the Green Party, I also want to register our objection to the taking of the motion on the Council Regulation on the European Enforcement Order. Again it seems to reflect an undemocratic and autocratic approach, particularly regarding European matters, which must stop. I ask that the Government would indicate to us what overriding considerations can be identified to argue that there is any justification for bringing forward an item, of which the Whips have not been made aware, and which is, from our point of view, completely unacceptable in any democratic parliament.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Is the question agreed to?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	19	There is no overriding reason, is there?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I explained the reason earlier.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Is proposal No. 3 regarding the taking of Question Time tomorrow agreed to?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It is not agreed. First, the taking of questions which do not allow for any participation by many Members of the Opposition on Priority Questions cannot be acceptable in itself. There are a number of groups which are not given recognition during Priority Questions – the Green Party, Sinn Féin, the Socialist Party Deputy and Independent Deputies. We will be objecting to it on that basis alone.However, there is the added insult to this House in the fact that the referendum Bill is apparently not to be published until after Foreign Affairs questions.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	23	That does not arise now. In fact, the Chair has given you some latitude because we are dealing with the timing of Question Time.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	24	It is the one opportunity during which this House can be accountable to the people and the Government can be accountable to this House.

I do so on the grounds that I am a member of a party which does not have the opportunity to participate in an important aspect of business conduct in this Chamber, namely, Priority Questions. It is a key and crucial vehicle for all Members, yet the Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Independent Deputies, including Deputy Higgins, are excluded.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The question before us deals exclusively with the time at which questions will be taken tomorrow.

#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The Standing Order provides for a brief statement relating to the proposal before us.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Forfás report on prices confirms what many people have believed for some time, namely, that inflation is growing and price increases are being introduced across a range of consumer products and services. The report indicates that the cost of living in this country is the second highest in the euro zone. Finland is the only country in which it is now more expensive to live. It also confirms the trends revealed in a similar report, contested by RGDATA, comparing prices in Dublin and St. Tropez. While some of these dramatic price increases may well be attributable to the euro changeover, it is also clear, as the reports reveal, along with a continuing headline rate of 4.8%, that there is a serious and persistent inflation problem. The report indicates that the sectors in which prices rose unusually sharply during the changeover included dentists', doctors' and opticians' fees, pharmaceutical products, cinemas, package holidays, beer, spirits and soft drinks in licensed premises, restaurant meals, hairdressers and the provision of services to householders.Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government has taken its eye off the ball? Does he accept that the continuing rise in the inflation rate is now one of the most serious economic difficulties facing the country and that it is affecting the daily lives of thousands of people struggling to make ends meet? Could he advise the House on his proposals to reverse this trend?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Does the Taoiseach now regret the refusal of his previous Government to introduce some form of price control in January, three months from the conversion to the euro, so that we could have clearly monitored the profiteering that seems to have taken place in a limited number of areas? In light of the reporting on the Forfás report in today's newspapers, does the Government intend to introduce a programme of enhanced competition in protected private sector areas which are not open to the forces of competition that can bring down prices?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Forfás commissioned this report last February at the request of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, to identify any unusual price movements during the euro changeover period and to examine the comparative price levels across the euro zone countries. The comparative analysis was taken back to 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers carried out the research in collaboration with Joe Durkan of UCD. I do not have a copy of the report. Forfás has not yet given the report to the Government but, according to the reports, which I assume are accurate because they usually are in these cases, the findings were that there was no widespread profiteering associated with the euro changeover. However, in specific areas some unusual price increases have been identified. These include doctors', dentists' and opticians' fees, food prices in restaurants and the price of alcoholic drink in pubs and off-licences.In reply to Deputies Kenny and Quinn, when the Government receives this report it will examine it in detail and set about taking action where it can. Other comparative work done over the last six months also shows that wage increases have risen and outstripped those of other countries. Together with the fact that inflation has been quite high over the last number of years, this  means that our ranking will have gone right up. We have been rising in the rankings for the last seven or eight years, so the fact that we are second does not surprise me.The Government will, of course, give close attention to the findings of the report as soon as we receive it and, as we have done in recent years, we will focus on bringing about greater competition, in the interest of consumers, in the areas identified. These areas are clearly the professions. This is not the first report to identify this: it has been outlined in the regulatory report I published last February and identified in the regulatory work which is continuing in a number of Departments to deal with these issues. The root cause of a number of problems in the professions is the regulatory regime we operate, which is fairly closed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I do not know whether the Taoiseach has noticed the increased price of drink in his own local but it seems that everybody feels they are getting less for their money. We may have the second highest level of prices in Europe but we do not have the second highest level of wages. This is a critical matter for hundreds of thousands of families.Does the Taoiseach accept that in 1997, when he came into office, he inherited an inflation rate of 1.5%, which was then the lowest in Europe, and that after five years of Fianna Fáil and PD Government, the inflation rate is now 4.8%, which is double the European average? Has he discussed this with the Cabinet? Does he intend to take measures to reduce inflation, which is putting so many families under pressure?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	34	With economic growth rates averaging 7.5% to 8% over a number of years, inflationary pressures were inevitable. All our economic policies aim to address that and to keep inflation as low as possible. It is a fact that our wage levels, as shown in all the comparative analyses, are some of the highest in the euro zone. That is a fact and a feature of the situation. All of these matters will need to be examined in the report but report or no report, greater competition and regulatory reform are absolutely essential to keep order on prices. It is clear from reading the reports of the Forfás survey that these price increases are not just related to the euro changeover.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	35	In the interests of social partnership and the maintenance of good relations between workers and employers, will the Taoiseach raise with the board of Ardagh plc, a company in my constituency that reported profits last year of €49 million, its refusal to implement a Labour Court recommendation to grant five weeks' termination to workers being made redundant in the interest of profit? The plant is currently being occupied by these workers who have co-operated over a number of years with this  company and have been treated in an outrageous fashion. Will he endeavour, through IBEC, with which this Government is intimately connected, to have this matter raised directly? It is undermining confidence in social partnership in a manner that does no good to anybody who is working in this country.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	36	In view of the fact that he was one of the principal architects of the continuation of social partnership, which is very important for the economic wellbeing of the country, will the Taoiseach give us an indication of how things are progressing on that front?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I will take up the matters requested by Deputy Quinn. This has gone on for some time and it would be best to deal with it through the social partners and the implementation group. The Deputy has asked me to take it up with IBEC.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	38	No, with the company.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I will take it up with them. I presume the company is represented by IBEC, as the Deputy said. The work of social partnership continues and discussions on the next round of social partnership, whether there is to be an agreement or not, will take place in the autumn.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	40	These workers are an example of workers who have lost their jobs over the last number of years and have been denied the redundancy packages recommended by the Labour Court. It is not that there is a lack of money in the social insurance fund. The Taoiseach's Government, in the last budget, raided the fund, which is not the Government's money but belongs to the employers and the workers. It is a separate fund. It was raided to the tune of €635 million to make this budget appear to balance its books. The cost of the package in relation to the IGB, for example, is €24 million, less than half the profits declared by this company. A change is required in the legislation. My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, has repeatedly asked for the legislation to be amended to bring it in line with normal Labour Court recommendations which are, on average, a minimum of two weeks per year. Is the Taoiseach prepared in light of the amount of money in the social insurance fund to amend the legislation to bring it into line with what has been the practice of the Labour Court for some time and to make it retrospective for workers such as those in Peerless Rugs in Athy and others who lost their jobs through liquidation and where the liquidator had no discretion to pay above the statutory recommendations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	41	There are a number of points. The social insurance fund is in considerable surplus so there is no difficulty. The Deputy's interpretation appeared to suggest that, because some money was taken out of the fund, it was in deficit. There is no difficulty with any drawdown from  the social insurance fund because it is in considerable surplus. The traditional practice is that any Labour Court decision should be honoured. I have always taken that view and have always insisted that the Government take it. We have always stuck to them. Even in difficult years Labour Court recommendations have been honoured by Government. In this case, a private company is involved which obviously is not honouring its commitments following negotiations. I will take up that matter.On the legislation, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated previously that she had begun the preparation of new legislation. I am sure that will form part of the September list of new legislation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Has the Taoiseach any proposals to amend the Competition Acts to bring about greater competition in the marketplace, especially in light of a recent Forfás report on prices in the context of the euro changeover and other factors in the economy which the Government has failed to address over a considerable period?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	43	There is no specific legislation but the regulatory reform committee across a number of Departments is working in several areas, such as electricity, insurance and gas, and examining these issues.

In light of the Forfás report and a report published yesterday on Ireland losing its free economy rating, when will that decision be taken and the legislation brought forward, especially given Aer Rianta's objection to competition in car parking at Dublin Airport?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The relevant Minister will bring forward legislation in due course if it is required. It is to separate the board functions of Aer Rianta.

The Taoiseach controls the timetable. Will he give an undertaking to the House that it will be published before noon tomorrow?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	49	It will be published as soon as possible.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I move:That Dáil Eireann approves the exercise by the State of the option, provided by Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:a proposal for a Council Decision concerning the signing of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on the re-admission of persons residing without authorisation,a copy of which measure was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21st May, 2002.I will first refer to some of the remarks which were made on the Order of Business regarding the sequence of events that has led to four matters concerning the EU being dealt with this morning. As will become apparent in the course of this morning's proceedings, the four particular measures which are different from one another fall to be discussed today in circumstances of urgency which were not of my creation. Deputy Quinn rightly stated that we should be in a position to give adequate scrutiny to matters involving family law, particularly when dealing with two matters which arise later on the Order Paper. Those are sentiments with which I agree entirely. The position I was faced with, which Members will appreciate, is that if we did not opt into the discussion and drafting process for those measures before a date in August, we would be prevented from participating in the discussion process in its entirety. Therefore, the dilemma I found myself faced with was that I had to choose between opting out of the discussions because there was not enough parliamentary time to pass the two motions which are before the House, or allow other people to decide the substance of the proposals and give Ireland an opt-in or opt-out choice at the end of the process, or to give this House an opportunity to give Ireland the option to participate in the discussion and formulation  stage of the two measures which come later this morning.On balance, I thought it more democratic, though unsatisfactory, to give the House the opportunity to look at the substance of what is being discussed regarding those matters, even though I accept that adequate notice was not given to the House and that the amount of time allowed to consider these matters has been curtailed. As the Taoiseach said, it would be more satisfactory if a committee of the House was up and running and able to scrutinise European instruments and proposals, rather than having a debate which is necessarily more formal and less detailed than might otherwise be the case.I ask Members to accept that I am not trying to trample over the House. I was faced with a dilemma, particularly regarding the two later measures, that we would not play any part in their negotiation because the House had not had adequate opportunity to consider whether it really wanted to be part of the negotiations. On balance, I thought it was fairer to afford the opportunity to consider an opt-in at this stage rather than at a later stage.I thank the House for making time available to discuss the exercise by the State of the option under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam on a proposal for a Council decision concerning the signing and conclusion of a re-admission agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. I favour the scrutiny role of the Oireachtas in matters such as this.The subject of this agreement which is the re-admission of persons residing without authorisation, falls under Article 63 of the treaty establishing the European Community. This is part of Title IV of the treaty which was added by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999. Title IV deals with measures in the area of visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons. The Amsterdam treaty conferred powers on the Community in the field of re-admission.The application of Title IV to Ireland is subject to the provisions of the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Ireland is not automatically a participant in measures under Title IV unless we exercise an option provided for in the protocol. Under the terms of the protocol we have three months from the date a proposal is presented to the Council to exercise the option to take part in the adoption of the proposed measure. We may also exercise the option at any time after a measure has been adopted by the Council. Article 29.4.6º of the Constitution provides that, in order to exercise the option, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas must be obtained. It is with a view to seeking this approval that I am before the House.There are two Council decisions proposed and therefore there are two motions before the House. One decision concerns the signing of the  agreement and the other concerns the conclusion of the agreement by the Council. As the subject matter of both proposals is the same, I propose to deal with both of these matters together. The two motions may be discussed separately if Members wish.Re-admission agreements are a significant feature of international co-operation in the field of immigration. Indeed a re-admission and return policy is recognised internationally as an integral and vital element in the fight against illegal immigration. Ireland has been aware of the need for such agreements and in recent years has negotiated a number of bilateral re-admission agreements. To date such bilateral re-admission agreements have been signed with Romania, Poland, Nigeria and Bulgaria.The proposed Community re-admission agreement with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region which is before the House is the first such agreement to be negotiated to a conclusion by the European Commission on behalf of all member states. The exercise of the option will allow Ireland to be a party to the agreement.Community re-admission agreements form part of the European Union's broader aim of developing a balanced, coherent and common approach towards immigration and asylum. Apart from Hong Kong, to date the European Commission has been authorised to negotiate re-admission agreements with Russia, Morocco, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and the Special Administrative Region of Macau. The re-admission agreement with Hong Kong will be the first to enter into force.I fully support the view that the return and re-admission of third country nationals who are illegally resident in the EU must be an integral part of our common immigration and asylum policy. Re-admission agreements involve reciprocal undertakings by the European Union and third country partners to co-operate over the return of illegal residents to their country of origin. This is not simply one way traffic. The EU is adopting the same obligations as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The comprehensive approach which has been put forward focuses on the adoption of common procedures for the legal admission of third country nationals. However, the European Commission has emphasised that these policies must be accompanied by measures to combat illegal migration and, in particular, smuggling and trafficking of human beings and the return of persons who are illegally present in the EU.In its recent publication entitled Communication on the Common Policy on Illegal Immigration, the European Commission has underlined that the return and re-admission of third country nationals who are illegally resident in the EU must be an integral part of the common policy.I will now outline the principal features of this agreement. It should be noted that the re-admis sion obligations set out in the agreement are drawn up in a fully reciprocal way. Article 2 states that Hong Kong shall re-admit its permanent residents and former permanent residents provided that they are validly shown to be so.Article 3 states that Hong Kong shall readmit persons of another jurisdiction under certain specified circumstances. The obligation to readmit persons of another jurisdiction arises where, at the time of entry into a member state, such persons held a valid visa or residence authorisation issued by Hong Kong or, having entered the territory of Hong Kong, they proceeded to enter unlawfully the territory of a member state.Article 4 deals with the re-admission by member states of the Community of their own nationals. Proof of nationality or former nationality is required. If necessary, member states will be required to issue a travel document. Article 5 provides that a member state shall re-admit persons of another jurisdiction in specified circumstances and shall provide, as necessary, a travel document.Articles 6 to 11 contains the necessary technical provisions regarding the re-admission procedure – re-admission application, means of evidence, time limits, etc. Articles 12 and 13 concern transit operations.Articles 14 to 16 contain the necessary rules on costs, data protection and the non-affectation of other international rights and obligations applicable to the parties.Article 17 states that a re-admission committee shall be set up to, among other things, monitor the application of the agreement and implementation procedures.Article 18 empowers member states to conclude bilateral implementing protocols with Hong Kong. The relationship between such implementing protocols and the agreement is clarified in Article 19.Articles 20 to 22 contain the necessary rules on entry into force, duration, termination and the legal status of the annex to the agreement.Ireland has a long history of legal migration from Hong Kong and China in general and the numbers of people coming here have been increasing in recent years. There were almost 12,000 Chinese nationals resident in the State in 2001, almost double the number in 2000. The number from Hong Kong was of the order of 500 in 2001. Chinese nationals come here mainly as workers and students and make a significant input to the economy. In this regard, it should be noted almost 1,000 work permits were issued in respect of Chinese nationals in 2001. I should point out that 80% of foreigners resident in Ireland hold work permits. Sometimes media coverage of this issue fails to reflect that fact.In recognition of the significant number of Chinese nationals who seek to enter the State, my Department has recently posted visa processing staff to the Irish Embassy in Beijing. This will improve the service being provided to Chinese nationals who wish to come to Ireland.The existence of the proposed re-admission agreement with the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong is not expected to have any significant effect in Ireland where the incidence of illegal immigration from the region is low. It should be noted that the existence of a re-admission agreement does not affect the consideration of the merits of any claim from an individual for leave to remain in the State. Neither does it affect the human or constitutional rights of individuals or any apprehended violations of those matters either; it is purely facilitative. In any individual case where deportation is being considered, the provisions of section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, will apply. That section sets out a range of factors which the Minister must consider before a deportation order is made. The return of an asylum seeker would also be subject to the provisions of section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as regards the prohibition of refoulement or the return of the person to possible persecution.I commend this motion to the House. The development of return policy, of which re-admission agreements form an important part, is a vital element in the development of a common immigration and asylum policy at European level.

As far as the procedures to which the Minister referred are concerned, I am mindful that the motion was foisted upon him. From his tone, it appears he is not happy about the way the schedule was put together at short notice and then issued to the Opposition. Members on this side of the House are operating, to a certain extent, on a need to know basis. However, regardless of what the Minister said, it would not do any harm if prior consultation took place.When a motion of this kind is placed before the House, Opposition spokespersons would be grateful if they were contacted by the Department and informed about its meaning in layman's terms. We could have avoided the necessity to call two votes and also the song and dance and posturing which marks what happens in this House. I ask the Minister not to assume that I am going to make a song and dance about something that is so technical in nature. If we had been contacted about the motion beforehand, we could have reached an agreement and saved time. Again, I do not have any difficulty with the substance of the motion.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The basic point that arises involves the technical aspects of this matter. There must be a better way of dealing with these provisions. The Treaty of Amsterdam required that there would have to be prior approval, from both the Dáil and Seanad, to enable us to opt in. As Deputy Deasy stated, it is a question of putting in place a better procedure for the future.  The Minister should give consideration to that and he should hold discussions with the Opposition parties about it in order that matters of this nature are not sprung upon us. I accept that the Minister is operating within the bounds of a tight timetable and had to draw up a Cabinet memorandum and seek Government approval. There is a further problem in that the Spanish want the matter dealt with before the end of their Presidency, which occurs at the end of the month. There is pressure from all sides. We must have a reasoned discussion with regard to how we can put a better procedure in place for the future.The substance of the matter involves Hong Kong, which has major problems in terms of the need to deport illegal immigrants from mainland China. As far as I can see, we are not dealing with the denial of human rights or persecution of people in Hong Kong because the rush is from mainland China into that territory. We do not really have a problem vis-à-vis the arrival here of significant numbers of illegal immigrants from Hong Kong.If we had time available, we could discuss the overall situation in China and Hong Kong but there is no scope for that at this stage. In the meantime, let us agree to seek a better way for dealing with motions of this kind in the future.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The Minister said that the need for urgency here is not of his creation and I accept that. He also stated that he has no wish to trample on the rights of the House and I entirely accept that comment at face value. However, I wish to make the point that the first occasion we saw the minimal papers on these measures was yesterday afternoon. Irrespective of the circumstances in which the Minister finds himself, the papers relating to these regulations could have been transferred to the spokespersons long before now.There may be no difference between the parties in the House on the substance of the measures, but the issues involved are not trivial. There is a great deal of interest among members of the public about immigration. We must consider this matter in the context of its emergence from the Council itself. The entire Council process is amazing. From experience during our last Presidency, I can state that it was unusual to find oneself at a Council meeting having only the night before been briefed on fairly major matters. As president of two Councils, I was very fortunate that my officials and the permanent representation in Brussels at the time were of such high calibre. However, it really is extraordinary that an organisation called COREPER, in other words bureaucrats, which is a term I do not use disparagingly, decides a great many of these matters and the Council takes place behind closed doors. If one was to carry out a vox populi on the streets for a full week, one would not find a single person who had ever heard of COREPER. That is not an ideal situation and in terms of measures which  emerge from this process, the least we ought to have is an opportunity to discuss them here. I note the Minister's comments on the future and the fact that committees will have an opportunity to discuss these matters.I was intrigued by the notes from the Minister's office dealing with the agreement between Hong Kong, on the one hand, and the European Union, on behalf of all the member states, on the other hand, notably the delicately phrased issue of "persons residing without authorisation". The fact that I had not heard this phrase before shows it is very bad to be out of the loop for a long time as one does not keep up with the jargon.The specific matter which caught my eye, on which I would like to hear the Minister's views, relates to Article 63(3)(b) which is the one which provides that the Council shall adopt measures on general immigration policies and so on. It contains a specific reference to the Council meeting held on 27 and 28 May 1999 and to the fact that “it concluded that re-admission agreements would constitute a valuable instrument of an active expulsion policy.” I can understand why re-admission agreements ought to be a sensible prerequisite of policy in this area, but what exactly is meant by “would constitute a valuable instrument of an active expulsion policy”? Does it mean that once such bilateral agreements are in place, one proceeds with the expulsion mechanism in terms of illegally resident immigrants?Like Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I would have liked an opportunity to raise the wider question of human rights on the Chinese mainland. Could any of the people so repatriated ultimately end up there and if so, are there any safeguards or guarantees built in in terms of the human rights of people in these circumstances? As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated, it is not an issue we can discuss in any detail here given the time provided. However, I am curious about whether repatriation to Hong Kong means only that or also involves the wider mainland.We have had parliamentary questions and debates on the treatment of the Falun Gong, which gives me an opportunity to mention the recent decision by a member of the Garda Síochána to write to Members of the House about the issue. I was somewhat surprised and a little puzzled that the letters never reached most Members. The garda in question appeared to be acting as an interested citizen who, for whatever reason, had developed an interest in the Falun Gong issue and chose to communicate with Members. I am puzzled as to why action should have been taken not to facilitate the transfer of these letters to the Members to whom they were directed.On the substance of the agreement, my party has no objection to facilitating the required opt-in here in respect of this title and is agreeable to it.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins. The Minister stated that the order before us is purely facilitative and on face value that can be accepted. However, in its philosophical tone, a re-admission agreement is an acceptance on the part of those who are promoting it and have the highest vested interests in ensuring it is reached that there are people in its jurisdiction who should not be there and should return to the country from which they came. One can dress that up in any kind of legal vernacular one chooses, but that is the crude truth at the heart of a re-admission agreement. On those terms the Green Party is very concerned about entering into re-admission agreements, the motivations behind them and their subsequent use.Independently, we have entered into re-admission agreements with Romania, Poland, Nigeria and Bulgaria. Ironically, we support three of these countries in their efforts to join the European Union as part of the enlargement process. The terms of a possible accession agreement will mean that the citizens of one of these states, Poland, will not have the right of freedom of movement in terms of the labour market if it becomes a member of the European Union. There is, therefore, a double standard at play.In addition, while we, as an independent nation, choose to use our sovereignty to enter into individual agreements with countries with whose citizens we appear to have a difficulty in terms of our immigration policy, by entering into a European Union agreement we are deciding that the importance of any agreement we may have with the Hong Kong administrative area does not rate with that of agreements we have already entered into, that this is a national interest we are willing to forego and that the arrangement which will exist between the administrative area of Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China on its behalf will be with the European Union, not this country. We should be concerned on those grounds because it is a further diminution and dilution of our sovereignty.The history of migration between Hong Kong and Ireland has been largely successful. The people of Hong Kong are industrious, entrepreneurial and successful and I cannot think of grounds for using a re-admission agreement to ask them to return to a situation which, as other speakers highlighted, is fraught with danger. We must also acknowledge that Hong Kong is not and was not a democracy, either as part of the "two systems, one country" policy of the People's Republic of China or as a British colony before that. If there are grounds for seeking asylum on political and human rights grounds, the people of Hong Kong have them, particularly as the changeover from British colony to becoming part of the People's Republic of China was handled so shabbily for many of its citizens. We should reinforce the historical relationship between our peoples to make sure the people of Hong Kong do not fall foul of further poor decisions.In saying that, it should also be highlighted that Hong Kong, particularly as a British colony – I am not sure of the current position – has a very shabby record as a centre of net immigration. Its record of holding people fleeing Vietnam in large detention centres is appalling. I would like us to have had the opportunity for a wider debate arguing those histories and putting question marks over the types of relationships we are willing to enter into, not as an independent sovereign nation but as part of a bigger political unit. We should take time to ask questions and oppose such measures until a better system is put in place for dealing with situations such as this.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	96	This is a shameful proposal from an Irish Government. It is incredible that the Government is proposing involuntary repatriation of people to Hong Kong, which is now a province of China. What is proposed is involuntary repatriation to a dictatorship. China is a brutal Stalinist regime where human rights are not just routinely not respected but actively trampled on on a daily basis. There are thousands of political prisoners and many are tortured, killed or executed without proper judicial procedure. This is the regime with which the Government proposes to deal in this agreement.Religious persecution is a daily fact of life. The Falun Gong is only the most recent example of how this regime will not tolerate any dissent or intellectual disagreement which might threaten its grip. Dai Dong Xue, a Chinese national living in Ireland who has been a supporter of the Falun  Gong, is being refused the right to visit China for urgent family reasons. The Chinese authorities will not renew her passport.Workers' rights are routinely trampled on. Free trade unions are not allowed. In recent weeks dozens of workers have been imprisoned in the Heilongjiang province because they protested against unemployment, unpaid wages and official corruption in the oil fields in that region. The rights of ethnic minorities are routinely repressed in a most brutal fashion. Amnesty International has often referred to Hong Kong's own deplorable record on human rights. Practitioners of Falun Gong have been put on trial in Hong Kong itself.It is incredible that the Irish Government is supporting a procedure of involuntary repatriation to this dictatorship. The new hard line by Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, including the new Minister who would fancy himself as an intellectual and a liberal, would support this measure. Even if no one was repatriated from this jurisdiction this measure, by implication, would support what the other member states are attempting to do and would give moral support to any repatriations they might carry out. We do not know what happens to people who are involuntarily repatriated. They may have the right to apply for political asylum but if this is not granted they are to be repatriated. If this happens they will find themselves falling foul of the regime, being picked up and disappearing.I trenchantly oppose this resolution.

The motion we have just dealt with concerned the signing of the agreement and this one concerns the conclusion of the agreement by the Council. That is done for technical reasons and the details of the agreement were set out in my earlier contribution. I will take this opportunity to reply to the points raised by Deputies in the previous debate.Regarding the procedures we face, I want to be quite clear in supporting the spirit in which Deputies Deasy, Jim O'Keeffe and Rabbitte made their comments. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the procedures of the Justice and Home Affairs Council are such that it frequently gives rise to late decisions being made and early timeframes being assumed for their implementation. I recently spoke to the incoming Danish Minister and she indicated that it was her intention to make the business of the Justice and Home Affairs Council more efficient with less formal diplomatic speechifying and a more informal and businesslike approach.Deputy Rabbitte referred to the COREPER meetings which are meetings by diplomatic representatives of the member states preceding Council meetings. It was hoped that those meetings should take place a week in advance of Council meetings to leave plenty of time for consideration of matters which arise at that stage. I generally agree with Deputy Rabbitte's point that it is not satisfactory that important matters are dealt with in this way. I want to assure Deputies that my personal instinct, philosophy and inclination is to make it clear that in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, member states should be given plenty of time to consider proposals. Proposals should not be presented at the last minute, there should be no surprises or shocks and things should not be put up for discussion at short notice. Those values will inform my participation in Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings. I will not be rushed or stampeded into measures which I have not had time to carefully consider.The same applies to this House. It is my desire that the democratic deficit, which is often spoken about as existing in the European Union at both central and member state level, will be addressed to as great a degree as I can bring about. I hope to have a good relationship with all Members of this House, but particularly the Oppositions spokespeople, so as to give fair and adequate warning of things that are coming up. I intend to give briefings to Members who are interested in these matters as they develop on the European stage. That assumes that I am given fair and adequate warning by the Commission of the proposals for developments at Council meetings. In so far as it lies within my power to bring about that change I will do so. I will pass on the compliment to Members of this House in keeping them as informed as they wish to be on these matters. Ideally, a standing committee of this House would deal with these matters. It would not simply deal with things in arrears but look at developments and receive regular briefings on forthcoming developments.I listened to what Deputy Joe Higgins said about human rights in Hong Kong and I share some of his anxieties about the People's Republic of China. Every protection open to a person under Irish law remains in place regardless of whether we have a system for facilitating the return of refugees. No one's rights are being removed in this bilateral agreement.

I appreciate the Minister's comments and would appreciate greater consultation on issues like this. Some of us are not in here to score points. We would like to support the Minister on issues like this and not waste time. Yet we will blame him if things go horribly wrong.I have been in this House about two weeks and all I have heard is the Green Party, Sinn Féin and others complaining about the allocation of time. They are the greatest time wasters of all. They have been complaining for two weeks about not having time to speak. They are wasting everyone else's time on pointless procedures. They are wasting our time and ultimately, they are wasting the people's time. As far as I am concerned they are here to do some work but all they are doing is wasting everyone's time. It is time they got off their high horses, stopped being so self-righteous about these things and did some work so that we can get things done.

That is important. That mind-set must be changed at all levels. We must take into account the situation in Europe and the timetables of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers. We must change from the old system where the Government of the day came to a decision, put it before the Dáil and thought it would be rubber stamped. I am not sure if we will do that through greater resources for the Committee on European Affairs or for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which deals with such issues. That is a matter for discussion. I will be happy provided we achieve the objective of dealing with these issues in a better way in the future.Unfortunately, the Constitution requires that there must be prior approval of the Dáil and Seanad. There will not be enough time for detailed discussions of such measures in the Dáil and Seanad. It should be preceded by committee debate and then we can have a formal discussion in the Dáil and Seanad. These are serious issues which we have not had time to discuss.

I was a little surprised we did not get some type of dissertation from the Minister on the more complex issues of parental responsibility, the rights of the child, abduction and the recognition of matrimonial matters. We will have achieved our purpose if we have a common agreement for the future to ensure we put in place proper procedures for proper debate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I welcome the statement of intent by the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I hope he can give effect to it. It has a wider significance than the instruments before us this morning. Without delving into the Nice issue, there are many different views on why the people voted the way they did. One of them is still the remoteness and impenetrability of some of the procedures and processes of the Union. The one I raised about the manner and functioning of COREPER and the Council of Ministers falls into that category. The Minister's remarks are welcome in that regard. I do not want to labour the point, but I am advised – I am not able to say it from my direct knowledge – that there is a raft of instruments under this section of the Amsterdam treaty and that most of them were dealt with in the same fashion. They were transferred to the Opposition spokespersons more or less at the last minute and the opportunity was not there to give them the type of consideration and scrutiny they deserved. Perhaps there should be a change of attitude closer to home than the Commission and the Council of Ministers. Sometimes one gets the impression that some aspects of officialdom think the Opposition should be given the mushroom treatment. That is not a good way to do business. I welcome the statement outlined by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I acknowledge the statement of intent by the Minister. Despite what he has seen, he is assured of our co-operation. I must respond to the points raised by the Fine Gael spokesperson. My position as a Member of the Dáil is to oppose measures. During the last debate I advanced a number of arguments about why the measure was wrong. I exercised my right as a Member of the Dáil to call a vote. I do not regard that as messing with procedures. We have seen unfortunate incidents in the House in recent days. However, the record of the House will show that on the Order of Business this morning a vote was called by the Labour Party. Fine Gael called a vote on the Order of Business yesterday. We want proportionate speaking rights. We do not want them on a grace and favour basis. Once that happens, I am sure we can proceed with the business of the House. The Minister will be glad to know we will not call a second vote, but we will indicate our dissent with a voice vote. We look forward to things being done differently in terms of information being given to Members of the  House, particularly to Opposition spokespersons. That will ensure better informed debates and, therefore, better informed decisions in the future.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	106	As regards the Fine Gael spokesperson, I appreciate that Deputy Deasy has only arrived in Leinster House and has only been appointed his party's spokesperson for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am sure if he had more time prior to today's discussion to research this important issue he would have been more aware of some of the critical issues concerning the life and death of human beings in China or Hong Kong. He might appreciate more readily why Members of the Opposition have expressed grievous concern about the Minister's proposal to involuntarily repatriate people to those dictatorships and called for the opportunity for the elected Members of Dáil Éireann to cast a vote for or against. That is the function of the elected Parliament.I heard what the Minister said about the democratic deficit. It is to be welcomed that any further far-reaching proposals which will come before the Dáil will be preceded by more notice to allow the Opposition to give due research and thought to how the Dáil should decide. However, the Minister scarcely alluded to what is the most serious democratic deficit of all in this discussion and proposal, namely, the decision to toss people back to dictatorships who do not want to go there. If the Minister came with a similar proposal for Iraq, would the parties in the Dáil be as anxious or acquiescent in that regard? It does not matter that people have safeguards in Irish law. If people avail of the safeguards and the decision is still made to repatriate them, there is no control in Irish law over what happens to those individuals once they are landed back in Hong Kong.One of the features that any human rights organisation will point out is the utter arbitrariness of law in China. It is made on the hoof to suit the governor or section of the Stalinist bureaucracy which has control of a particular region. People do not know what will happen to them. People who did not have a previous political grievance and were not politically active, but who found themselves pitched out of this country or any EU state and landed back in Hong Kong might find that sections of the bureaucracy take serious exception to something they have done or to the fact they have been deported back there. They might, therefore, arrest them and subject them to the arbitrary procedures which everyone agrees applies. Therefore, I hope there will not be a repetition of this but it is a shameful proposal and I reiterate my concern and utter opposition to it.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option, provided by Article 3  of the Fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measures:proposal for a Council Regulation on a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims; andproposal for a Council Regulation concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility repealing Regulation (EC) No. 1347/2000 and amending Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 in matters relating to maintenance;copies of which proposed measures were laid before Dáil Éireann on 7th June, 2002.These motions relate to the exercise by the State of the option which we have to take part in the adoption and application of the proposals for a Council Regulation creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims and a Council Regulation concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility. These measures were presented by the European Commission on 13 and 15 May last, respectively. Deputies will note the timeframe in which I have been working and, of course, the general election intervened. These are measures to which the Fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam treaty applies. Under that protocol we have a three month period from the date of presentation to the Council within which to notify the President of the Council of our intention to opt into any discussions from the beginning. Those periods would expire on 14 and 16 August, respectively, and it was therefore essential that the approval of both Houses be sought before the summer recess.I reiterate that I was confronted with a situation where, on the one hand, I could have said these matters deserve debate and, even if parliamentary time is not available for a debate, we should participate in the discussions. That was one choice. The alternative was to say these matters were so important that they should not be put through "on the nod" and that we should, therefore, opt out of the discussions and merely decide, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, whether we would opt into the product of that discussion process. Happily, parliamentary time became available, even in the attenuated form we have today. I share the concern of Deputies that these matters, as Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned – irregularly in the context of the last motion – are of fundamental importance and require that we consider them carefully in the Houses of the Oireachtas.Deputies will recall that this is the eleventh time on which the approval of both Houses will have been sought for the State to exercise the  option provided in the Fourth Protocol in respect of proposals in the area of EU judicial co-operation in civil matters. I consider it highly desirable that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have an enhanced role in scrutinising measures such as those which are under discussion today. Therefore, I am more than willing to facilitate the Houses in looking again at these measures when the negotiations on them have advanced somewhat. The modalities for such scrutiny can be worked out later when the Houses of the Oireachtas have organised and established a committee system to give life to the process of parliamentary scrutiny.I want to put on the record the Government's firm commitment to giving the Houses of the Oireachtas a full part in the vital process of democratic accountability in EU matters. When exercising options under the EU treaties, especially options which have a constitutional dimension such as this business, it is vital that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be fully involved and fully aware of the implications of the proposals. As part of a new, inclusive approach to EU affairs the Government is committed to strengthening parliamentary scrutiny, both by debates in each House, when appropriate, and by ongoing interaction and information at sessions of an Oireachtas committee on EU affairs. We are not going to push far-reaching measures through the adoption and scrutiny process "on the nod". To do so risks fuelling a sense of alienation and hostility based on a public perception of a democratic deficit in Ireland's approach to EU affairs. Today's debate marks a clear statement by my Department and the Government that we are determined that these matters should be approached in the future on the basis of positive partnership between the executive and legislative organs of government established under our Constitution.The measures which we are discussing have to be seen against the background of the development at EU level of measures geared towards the enhancement of judicial co-operation in civil matters. The overriding aim of this development is to make access to justice easier for the individual litigant. In that context, a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters was adopted in November 2000 by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. It aims ultimately at the abolition of the present system whereby, for a judgment given in one EU country to be enforced in another, a declaration of enforceability must first be sought from the courts of the country where enforcement is to take place. In broad terms, what this means is that a judgment obtained in Ireland could ultimately be enforced in Madrid in much the same way as a judgment obtained in Dublin can now be enforced in Donegal. It should be noted that a number of measures which link in with the programme have already been brought to the atten tion of the Oireachtas and have already been adopted.One of the proposed regulations which we are considering today creates a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims. The EEO is intended to facilitate the rapid recovery of outstanding debt which is essential for the proper and effective functioning of the Internal Market. The proposal focuses on the elimination of intermediate measures which, at present, are a prerequisite for enforcement in one member state of a judgment that has been obtained in another. The proposal addresses the incongruity of delaying, for administrative reasons only, enforcement of a judgment concerning a claim that has not been disputed. Claims, for the purposes of the proposal as presented, are limited to pecuniary claims for specific amounts – referred to in Irish law as liquidated damages – irrespective of the amount at issue. The term "uncontested claim" is also defined in the proposal.Before a judgment on such a claim can be enforced, it is proposed that it must be the case that either no appeal is possible against the judgment or that the debtor has not made use of the possibility of lodging such an appeal within the time limits for doing so. The text proposes that an enforceable judgment on an uncontested claim must be certified as a EEO at the request of the creditor. For this to happen, the claim must meet certain requirements, such as no appeal being possible and the documents must have been served on the debtor in such as way as to guarantee a fair trial. It is proposed that the EEO certificate will contain a transparent and standardised summary of all the facts that characterise and individualise the content of the judgment and which are indispensable for enforcement. The certificate will also contain comprehensive information to the effect that the requirements for eligibility for certification as a EEO have been complied with.It is envisaged that an appeal against the grant of a certificate itself will be excluded under this proposal. The reasoning behind this is that if the debtor wants to prevent a European Enforcement Order certificate from coming into existence, he or she has to contest the claim and thus remove it from the scope of application of this proposal, as the proposal only applies to uncontested claims. If the claim remains uncontested upon application by the creditor it is up to the court of origin to examine the judgment to ascertain if it fulfils the requirements for certification. In this context the court will be aware that there will be no possibility to appeal against the resulting decisions. Before a judgment becomes enforceable, i.e., while an appeal is still possible, it is proposed that that judgment may be enforced provisionally. Such an enforcement certificate is reversed if the judgment is overruled on appeal. The system of granting provisional enforceability strikes a delicate balance between the interests of the creditor in swift enforcement and the interest of the debtor in avoiding potentially irreparable  damage if the loss incurred due to provisional enforcement cannot be recovered. It is considered to be a major advantage of the process which is being proposed that certification of a judgment as an EEO is done by the court of origin which is familiar with the case at issue and the procedural rules that have been applied, and that no judicial or other authorities of enforcement in member states need to be involved.I now turn to the proposed Council Regulation on judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility. This is a consolidated text which combines three other proposals which have already been the subject of motions before the House. Thus, there is nothing of substance in the scope of the present proposal which was not contained in those which have already been opted into. The first such proposal is the Brussels II regulation. In July 2000, France presented a proposed regulation aimed at dispensing with the need to go through any specific procedure in the state where enforcement is to take place in respect of a decision on parental responsibility that concerns rights of access to children.Given the time constraint I am under, I urge Members to read the script I have circulated. It has been the view of successive governments that it is important that we opt into measures such as these through the process of negotiation rather than have to make a take it or leave it decision on the finished result. Ultimately, these measures have to be adopted on the basis of unanimity and if we have serious concerns we can decline to adopt a measure. When a committee is established to consider these matters it will be my pleasure to keep its members and any other Members of the House fully briefed on the developments in the negotiations on these regulations so that the democratic deficit, to which I referred earlier, can be addressed in an appropriate way.

I have no difficulty with the first part of the motion. It makes good sense. I will reserve my position on the second part pending the outcome of the discussion that takes place. In the meantime I would appreciate if the Minister would keep the House apprised of this issue. People have difficulty with the lack of prior consultation and it would have been preferable to have the various aspects addressed by the Department. We will not oppose the motion.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	109	During the debate on the Nice treaty referendum an issue raised was the lack of adequate debate on matters such as this. If I recall correctly, in the course of discussions I had with the former Attorney General, John Rodgers, he made specific reference to regulation 1347 or to one of that kind. It highlights the need for adequate time to debate these issues.I appreciate the special circumstances surrounding the introduction of this motion. The  draft regulation was produced only a few days before the general election. In the meantime the Government has been formed but there are no committees in place. I accept the bona fides of the Minister on this issue, but it is important to reiterate that while the first draft appears to make commercial sense in that we should support the wider application of uncontested judgments and their enforcement, complex issues arise with regard to the second draft, although I appreciate we are concerned here with a consolidation.While I have not had the time to consider the original regulations and proposals, I would like to see the Minister's reports on this draft consolidation proposal. They deal with matters of mutual recognition in the matrimonial area, parental responsibility, the rights of the child and abduction. I am not sure how abduction is linked with the Hague Convention.The documents refer to the French proposals on access, but I have not had the time to consider the documents in sufficient detail to know what they are. Presumably they are concerned with separated parents and who will have automatic rights of access to children.There are a raft of issues here that will need to be considered in greater detail. The Minister proposes that we opt into these measures. As with the Nice treaty and anything to do with Europe, we are not at the races unless we are at the discussion stage. In view of this, I favour this country opting in to the negotiations. On that basis we can influence the ultimate outcome, the Oireachtas and the various committees can be fully informed on the process and at any stage Ireland can decide not be become party to any proposals. From that point of view it makes sense to opt into the discussions on these draft proposals.

I was a member of the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence, Equality and Women's Rights when a number of measures were presented for consideration. As has been the experience of other Members here, we did not have adequate time to read and debate documentation. In addition, I do not recall any interest by the media when we debated these issues in committee. I hope that will change under this Administration.

She has a specific interest in these issues and has been active, especially in relation to abduction cases. Her wisdom would be useful in these deliberations.I have no issue with the first item, which appears to be straightforward. The second item deals with parental responsibility. On 11 December 2001, a similar proposal was placed before the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for consideration. However, I am not sure how the current proposal relates to it as it appears to bring together two measures. The first is referred to as Brussels II, while the second, emanating mainly from France, deals with issues of parental responsibility and enforcement of judgments across European Union countries.The proposal considered by the committee at its meeting on 11 December 2001 dealt with the exercise by the State of the option under the fourth protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam in respect of proposals for a Council of Ministers regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matters of parental responsibility. I presume the current proposal deals with the same issue. Deputy O'Keeffe asked if it is fully in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Convention. The Minister appears not to have addressed this aspect and I would appreciate his consideration of it, as it was also a concern of other EU member states.At the committee meeting on 11 December, other issues arose on the definition of parental responsibility, including how broad it is. I am not aware if these questions have been addressed since then and I would appreciate if the Minister would advise on the current position. At the committee meeting the former Minster, Deputy O'Donoghue, circulated a speech in which he pointed out that it is fair to say that, based on the discussions that have taken place to date, certain aspects of the proposed regulations on parental responsibility have given rise to a degree of concern on the part of some member states. He went on to point out that one of the issues giving rise to problems for Ireland and others is how the draft regulations deal with the issue of wrongful removal and retention of a child. The position on this, and how it differs form that in the Hague Convention was set out in the Minister's briefing note, to which he referred and which was circulated to committee members. In his script, the Minister went on to point out that many EU member states have doubts as to whether the mechanism proposed in the draft regulation would prove better than the Hague Convention for securing the prompt return of the child. All of these issues, which are of great importance, need to be very carefully inspected before a final decision is made.I want to refer to one case without specifying its details. When I was a Member of the Seanad a case was brought to my attention involving a child with one Irish parent and one who was native to another EU country. Other Members of the Oireachtas, and I think Mary Bannotti MEP, were involved in trying to have the child returned to Ireland. The Irish parent had proper jurisdiction but the child was in the other country  which I will not name. The child was put into an institution there, not under the direct care of the other parent, and it was more than a year before the child was returned to the parent who had been given custody of the child. That was only one of the cases where there was huge trauma to the child concerned and to the parent here and the extended family.If these measures can address those issues and result in children being restored to whoever has been granted custody, then they are wholly welcome. I believe this will prevent such a situation ever arising again, although it has been difficult to sift through the information in the short time available to deal with this matter. I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to involve the Oireachtas in the debate, as I hope will also be the case with the wider public which has a great interest in this area. I certainly would not want to stop the process of the deliberations on this particular issue, which I think is very important.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I am sharing time with Deputy Ó Caoláin. The Green Party will not be opposing the adoption of either Council regulation, which may be of some surprise to the Minister. We believe that in many areas there is a case for sharing competence and jurisdiction on issues that are beyond the ability of a national government or a nation in general. There are shared concerns about the area of family law and the problems that arise from it. I, too, note the presence of Mary Bannotti, MEP, and salute the work she has done in this area.Decisions such as this need to be accompanied with changes in our own law in regard to parental responsibility and the care of children. I hope such changes will address the very language we use. I want to come from a slightly different perspective here because there is no denying that many family break-up situations and custody battles involve damage, in particular to the female partner in a relationship and in the relationship she has with the children. Many of the events we have seen in terms of child custody battles that have resulted in what is referred to as child abduction very often concern unauthorised access by the parent who does not have full access to the child. The consequences for the children themselves can be horrific.I hope that the law will not be framed in the usual way by the Judiciary. It is always, or predominantly, the mother who has to be seen as the pre-eminent parent in child custody situations. Men very often lose out in terms of how family law is drafted and applied. I hope potential changes in our national law can inform how family law at European level is developed as well. I do not mean to sound like John Waters but I think it is important that in the debate we have a perspective that is not often heard. Language is important. There is a very real difference between a child abduction where a child is not known or is not directly related to the child and where the child is taken away without authoris ation by a parent in a family break-up situation and legislation is required that properly reflects this. Other than that there is nothing which the Green Party can see fit to oppose in this proposal and we will, consequently, support it. We look forward to any proposed changes in this area which is badly in need of reform.

I hope it is appreciated that this is a criticism that is meant to be constructive in terms of the approach in the future. I attended the Whips meeting last Wednesday at which we saw the schedule of business for this week and it was only yesterday we had notice that these matters were coming before the House. I do not enjoy the resources of some of the larger parties and in terms of having the opportunity to properly go through the detail of such proposals I am left in an impaired situation. I hope that is appreciated and the comments of Members are taken on board.I welcome the indication in the Minister's address that he recognises the importance of referring these matters back again to the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is extremely important. I note also that the Minister indicates this will be properly accommodated when the Houses of the Oireachtas have organised and established a committee system. I ask the Minister's support for the organisation of this Chamber in advance of the committee system in order that the party I represent here, other parties and Independent Members will have the opportunity to play a full role and have the integrity of our position recognised in the Dáil Chamber.I have no objection in principle to the first element and note that the proposition centres on the whole area where claim is uncontested, which is a very important matter. I am prepared to accept that there is undoubtedly a cross-community benefit involved in that and I have no doubt it is something that will be of immediate import to many people, not only in business but in private situations.I have some concerns in regard to the latter end of it, similar to that expressed by other Members. The Minister indicated that the regulation is bringing together three earlier signposted regulations that had been addressed previously in this House. I contacted the Minister's office this morning but I have not yet been able to ascertain what the critical difference is between this and the regulations that were introduced and debated here in July 2000 and March and September 2001 respectively. What are the critical differences? It is not only an act of consolidation or reiteration of what was already there on the record. It is very important that we have a more detailed flow of information in order to inform Members of what are the critical effects of the measure that is now being proposed.One of the questions that concerns me about the presentation by the Commission of a further Council Resolution in September 2001 dealing with jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments on matters of parental responsibility – I am conscious of the priority of Community law as against national law in any of these situations – is that while the thrust of what the Minister is proposing in this instance may be desirable, is it based on a common judicial approach to each of these important matters in each of the member states or, in terms of national law within the member states of the European Community, do we have differences that will present in a number of critical areas? In the area of child abduction in particular, which has been alluded to already by a number of earlier speakers, what we are seeing here is that jurisdiction will change from the court of the original habitual residence of the child in a couple of situations, but it states "or where the child has resided in a new location for at least a year and has settled in his or her new environment". I wonder about the assessment of "settled in his or her new environment", and after a year or more, without contact or the opportunity of engagement with the other parent. I wonder what the process of assessment would be there in terms of the word "settled". A child at different ages can become accustomed to a new reality and a new living circumstance, but does that actually reflect "settled"? Is it something that we would be prepared to accept? What of the views, the objections and the real concerns of the non-present parent in such a situation? I am genuinely and sincerely concerned about that. There have been a number of high profile cases over the years, not only in this jurisdiction and between this jurisdiction and others, but also within the European Community, which would give rise to real concerns in a situation like that. In moving that jurisdiction to the court of new habitual residence of 12 months or more, are we looking at an approach in law, a judicial situation applying in law in another national arena, that will reflect on Irish standards and Irish approaches, or will the other parent be significantly disadvantaged as a result?I will not oppose this but I cannot openly endorse what is proposed because I have so many questions to ask and they are not answered in the text of the Minister's address. I hope he will take on board my concerns, which are legitimate and my comments which are meant to be constructive, and perhaps he will help us to come to terms with what he is proposing. I look forward to him accommodating further development of this debate in the months ahead.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This is a Bill of unusual importance for Members who, for however long they have had the privilege of being elected to this House, spend long working days here and it is important also to the electorate. All of us who serve as Ministers in different Departments develop our own distinct perspectives on the Dáil, the Seanad and the organisation that supports the Houses, but a Minister for Finance probably gets a differently shaded view.I did not fully realise the extent to which matters of day to day housekeeping affecting these Houses ended up on the timetable of the Minister for Finance. This may seem like an odd admission from a former Opposition spokesman on Finance. However, I am not talking about the "front of house" exercises such as introducing Estimates for the Houses or answering parliamentary questions. While of critical importance, they are merely the visible tip of a much bigger iceberg. Oireachtas Members, or groups of Members, frequently state that they are not given the back up facilities, including staff, that they need to do their work. The result is a regular patter of parliamentarian feet towards the door of the Minister for Finance, either on these premises or what they sometimes see as enemy territory in Upper Merrion Street. What I propose to do through this Bill is to make that journey totally unnecessary because, on the kind of matters I mentioned and on much more besides, the buck will stop with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.The Title of this Bill deserves some explanation. We in this House, and people generally, often use a kind of shorthand when referring to this place – Leinster House, the Oireachtas, Par liament, the Legislature, etc. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is a bit of a mouthful for ordinary conversation but there are times when we have to go for precision and the Title of this body must be precise. It cannot be the Oireachtas Commission because the Oireachtas consists of the President as well as the Dáil and Seanad. What we are concerned with in this Bill is the administrative machine which provides the back-up of essential services to serve and sustain these Houses and their Members in discharging their public functions. The Bill also provides for the financial process which keeps that machine oiled and which generates the various services utilised by Members.The essence of this Bill is that it provides for the Houses of the Oireachtas to be headed up by a Commission composed, with the exception of the Secretary General, of Members of this House and the Seanad, endowing them with an enhanced version of the powers vested in Ministers who have charge of Departments. More fundamentally, it provides the Commission with the financial resources, the upper limit to be specified in the Bill, to run that office and the financial affairs of the Houses for some years without having to come to the Minister for Finance or the Government.This scenario would replace the process which has applied to funding Oireachtas activities since the foundation of the State. Currently, the annual Estimate for the Office is introduced by the Minister for Finance and debated in this House in the same way as Estimates for other public services, with the expenditure being subject to controls and approvals by the Minister in much the same way as expenditure on Departments and Offices of State generally. Where complaints arose about this process they tended to relate to restrictions on budgets for new services or the expansion of existing services – much the same matters that involve the Minister for Finance and his Department in intermittent spats with other Ministers and their officials. More recently, complaints sometimes centred on the one obvious difference in the Estimates process between the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and spending Departments. They had Ministers who could line up early with their officials to argue against particular cuts proposed by Finance and, if business was not done, the Minister responsible for the Department could argue his or her case at the appropriate Government meeting.Members felt at a disadvantage when making a case for additional resources at Estimates time because they are ultimately dependent on the Minister for Finance promoting their side, often possibly against official proposals in his own Department, and to be their voice at the Government meeting which determined the allocations. Successive Ministers have been conscious of the constitutional independence of the Oireachtas when dealing with the Office. In practice, they were sympathetic to demands from the Office and reflected this as much as circumstances  allowed in the approach they took to requests for extra resources, although at times of necessity stringent cuts were made there as in other services. Procedures were established under which a specially designated group of Members met the Minister of the day to tease out and prioritise proposed expenditure. Recently, however, there was a change in the character of the criticism. Obtaining approval always took time and refusals were irksome, but in a faster-moving environment it has become a greater source of annoyance. There was also a concern that it is not appropriate that the Executive should control the resources of Parliament, the body charged with holding the Executive to account. The Bill addresses the traditional criticisms, but it does more than that. It is a practical response to the new conditions affecting these Houses and their Members and a recognition of new requirements and the evolution of new relationships between parliamentarians and Ministers or the organisations they head.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.The most recent plenary meeting on the overall implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness took place on 29 April. The two main items on the agenda were public service modernisation, including better regulation, and waste management. The meeting reviewed the progress to date of the strategic management initiative, including the findings of an independent evaluation of the SMI, and the current consultation process on foot of the publication of Towards Better Regulation, which was concerned with improving our regulatory framework procedures. The policy framework developed to deliver a waste management infrastructure was also considered.I understand that the community platform withdrew from the meeting as a protest against certain decisions taken by the Government. While I appreciate the sincerity of those concerned, I regard it as inappropriate to use such meetings as a forum for a public protest. I am taking into consideration the operational nature of the plenary meetings and the established relationships between the participants. As with all PPF plenary meetings, a detailed progress report was produced, with each Department setting out the progress being made under each action point in the PPF. My own Department exercises the main co-ordinating role for overall implementation of the programme as well as supporting a range of cross-departmental issues such as public service modernisation, infrastructure delivery, social inclusion and the information society. The progress report, copies of which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library, records the continuing good progress in implementing the ambitious economic, social and structural agenda set out in the programme.The next plenary meeting is scheduled to take place on Thursday, 25 July 2002 and will focus on  social inclusion in the context of the PPF. I will be attending this meeting with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance, in accordance with established practice. This formal meeting complements the meetings I hold with representatives of the social partners on a regular basis.My Department chairs the National Implementation Body which was established under the adjustments to the terms of the PPF in December 2000. This body continues to meet as necessary to consider, in particular, the potential implications of any ongoing disputes of special national importance. It also provides opportunities for informal discussion of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process from the employer and trade union perspectives. Deputy Quinn has asked for my views as to whether there should be a new national agreement when the PPF expires. I indicated in reply to a similar question in this House on 24 April that I believe there should be a new agreement. My views have not changed and the Government's programme explicitly states that we will seek to negotiate a new partnership agreement to follow the PPF.As I have said many times before, I believe that the series of agreements we have had since 1987 have played a very significant role in the radical transformation of this country's economic and social fortunes in the recent past. It was by working together in a planned and disciplined way that we succeeded in reducing the national debt, embedding a pro-enterprise approach in our culture and society, generating enormous numbers of new jobs and raising living standards generally. The issues confronting us today, whether in terms of competitiveness, social cohesion or environmental sustainability, are no less complex and challenging and require a similar collective response. We have a choice. We can choose between planning and working together for success, as we have in the recent past, or pursuing sectional interests as we did in the pre-social partnership era. History signposts very clearly which is the best way to go.There are undoubtedly concerns on all sides which will need to be addressed if we are to have a new agreement. A strong dose of realism will be needed by everybody: Government, employers, trade unions, the farming sector and the community and voluntary sector. The focus should be on meeting those concerns, checked against reality, and on getting the right agreement, not on the principle of an agreement or on seeking an agreement for its own sake or at any cost. If we act together in a disciplined way in the national interest – because the national interest is all of our interests – we can achieve a consensus on the way forward and we as a society can continue to develop and move forward.In anticipation of possible negotiations between the Government and the social partners in the autumn of 2002, work is under way in the National Economic and Social Council on the development of a medium-term strategic analysis  which will provide the necessary intellectual and policy framework for such negotiations. As did the five previous strategy reports, it will set out the council's view on strategic policy approaches for the coming years, based on a review of developments in the Irish economy and society. The council is planning to finalise a report on the first phase of its deliberations for publication in July. In addition, the council is undertaking the following reports: The Management of Public Expenditure; Taxation and Welfare; and Regional Development in a Cross-Border Context: A Case Study of the North West.

I think he would agree with me that both his party and mine have been intimately involved in the process of social partnership since its inception. Does he agree with me, as the former Minister for Finance who ensured that the social partners – particularly the third community and voluntary pillar – were included in the process, that their walking out of the plenary session on 29 April, representing 26 national organisations, is unprecedented and that the reasons for their walk-out should be carefully and properly analysed?The Taoiseach spoke of the desirability of working together in social partnership. Does he not agree that a prerequisite for ensuring harmonious working relationships among partners is proper consultation? Does he accept, therefore, the validity of the criticism from those 26 groups that they had not been properly consulted about legislation regarding disability – which has now been so discredited that the Taoiseach himself sacked the Minister responsible for its introduction – and public order legislation, which played to certain populist fears across the country, and that they were justified in walking out as they did? Accordingly, what action does the Taoiseach propose to take to restore the harmonious working relationship that will be the foundation upon which a new programme of social partnership can be constructed, now that the era of a trade-off between tax cuts and moderate wage increases is no longer with us?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The groups cited four reasons for their actions: the Disability Bill, Traveller accommodation, restructuring of community employment schemes and the deportation of asylum seekers with Irish-born children. I agree with Deputy Quinn that we must address those issues as best we can and try to work on the concerns of the community and voluntary pillar or any of the pillars. A consultation process on the Disability Bill was launched some months ago whose purpose is to provide an opportunity for the parties to make their views known and for further consideration of the issues raised in relation to the Bill and for amendments to be made to the Bill. An expert consultation team was appointed in April and is meeting on an ongoing basis. It is considering the issues involved and the proposals  received from disability groups and is expected to meet with the interested parties over the coming months. It hopes to conclude its work as soon as it gets through that.With regard to the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government met with representatives of Travellers' organisations in May and reported on their views.On community employment schemes, a meeting was held with officials of my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and representatives of the social partners on the issues involved and contact is ongoing in this area.On the issue of asylum seekers with Irish-born children, the issue is before the courts. It would be inappropriate to comment pending the outcome of proceedings. However, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has met the social partners and the various community and voluntary groups on asylum and immigration issues and will continue to do so.I confirm to the Deputy that we will do all we can to try to deal with the issues of concern and address them as best we can.

The news management of his media communications unit must be complimented. I did not refer to community employment schemes but the Taoiseach gave me the pro forma reply in advance.Does the Taoiseach know what is happening throughout the country with community employment schemes? Does he realise a great national lie is being perpetrated on vulnerable communities who were told in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that community employment employees would be maintained at a level of 28,000, that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and leader of the party with whom he leads in coalition Government has committed herself—

I am rephrasing it so that he might go off note and answer it himself.Does the Taoiseach know what is going on? Does he realise a lie is being perpetrated on the  vulnerable communities who depend on community employment? There was an undertaking in the previous programme of social partnership, the PPF, that employment levels would be maintained at 28,000. The target from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach's partner in Government, is for 25,000. Lies are being told daily to participants, supervisors and groups—

I do not accuse any Member of telling lies. I am in order in saying that lies are being told to vulnerable citizens by people who are torn between the written commitments of social partnership in the PPF and the reality of the situation.Does the Taoiseach know what is happening? What has he said to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of her betrayal of the commitments he entered into in the PPF? If he does not raise those questions with her, what prospect of success does he have for a future social partnership agreement given that the current one is being unilaterally disregarded and betrayed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I wish to clarify for the Deputy, in case he thought I was very good at reading his mind, that my reply was to a question he tabled asking why 26 organisations under the community and voluntary sector walked out of a meeting under the PPF on 29 April. My reply referred to the position regarding community employment schemes which was cited by them as one of their four stated reasons for walking out. I referred back to that to give a complete reply.The previous Government decided in July 1999 to restructure the community employment scheme and it was indicated that participation levels were to be reduced to reflect the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, her officials and FÁS began to shift the emphasis away from work experience programmes to training where there is a greater level of progression to employment. That was at a stage when there were jobs available in certain sectors and it was almost impossible, which it still is to a certain degree, to hire people for them although there were still people on employment schemes. The effort was directed towards getting them jobs rather than their being on community employment schemes.The PPF contains a commitment to reduce overall place numbers to 28,000 by 2003 through re-allocation of the funding equivalent of 5,000 places to the social economy together with a reduction of 4,500 places required by the decision of July 1999. Mainstreaming school services, which is under way, and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including those in the health and environment sectors, will  further reduce the numbers employed in the programme. This has been confirmed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in detail on several occasions in the context of discussions with representatives of the social partners on the PPF standing committee on the labour market – it is an issue which arises continually – and in responses by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on Question Time under her area of responsibility. Under mainstreaming, the appropriate level of CE funding will transfer to the Departments with functional responsibility for the service in question. This is the direction being taken.There were 30,809 participants in the scheme at the beginning of this year. It is anticipated that the participation rate at the end of the year will be in the region of 24,000 to 25,000 depending on the rate of inflow to and outflow from the scheme. The phased reduction in numbers is part of a strategic shift in policy in favour of greater investment in training and other supports—

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Does the Taoiseach accept that it will be damaging to the partnership process if the Government, without talking to the social partners, breaks a commitment to retain the community employment programme at the level of 28,000 places? Regardless of his reply, does the Taoiseach accept it is bad for partnership to break that agreement and not to talk to the partners before doing so? Does he agree that, apart from many public amenities which depend on community employment schemes, some of which are threatened with being left in abeyance or unfinished, community employment schemes support many essential services, such as meals on wheels, which will not benefit from the employment figures to which the Taoiseach referred?On existing and, I hope, new partnership arrangements, does the Taoiseach agree there is a need for a new programme to support the essential services which depend on community employment schemes and not to downgrade the schemes before such a programme is put in place?Will the Taoiseach tell us or provide a list of the remaining commitments under the PPF which the Government has yet to honour and if these will be contained in the forthcoming budget or if the Government has taken a unilateral decision not to honour them?In the context of the Taoiseach's reply to my question yesterday on the summit in Johannesburg and in the context of the social partnership process, does he agree that it is time the environmental non-governmental organisations became part of the partnership process in the round and were not compartmentalised where they must do a separate job in a separate area? Does he agree  that it is time to make them part of the partnership process?

They are endeavouring to move away from social employment schemes to training programmes from which people can get work. The real purpose of the community employment schemes is that people work in them for a while before getting a real job. They were never meant to be permanent jobs.

Over 30,000 people have benefited. Flowing from the reports that were carried out, the Tánaiste is of a mind that it is better to grant aid some of the areas where they can use their resources to best effect. This is not easily done with all schemes but it is working well in the educational sphere despite the reservations.In response to Deputy Sargent's question about the Johannesburg Summit; within the social partnership process we hope to be able to ensure at a local and European local level that we represent the views of Government and the social partners.

Does he accept that these comments from a senior official are a further indication of the deteriorating relationship between the trade union movement and the employers and that they do not help to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations?During the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will soon reach its conclusion, additional pay increases had to be negotiated because of the impact of high inflation which is eroding the benefits to employees of the original package. In view of the persistently high inflation rate and the leaked Forfás report indicating that Ireland is the second most expensive country in the euro zone, what impact do the Taoiseach and the Government feel these cost of living increases will have on any future negotiations for a partnership agreement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	160	A wages chasing prices spiral would be damaging to the economy, eroding take home pay and other benefits workers have. However, in spite of inflation, the current increases in real take home pay in the PPF are considerably greater than the original figures anticipated. This has been the case in four of the five agreements. Just one of them was not to the benefit of the worker and increases fell but the other four have done remarkably well.Inflationary pressures are damaging to the economy and we know from experience that inflation can be corrosive to living standards and cause an unfair impact on the people's living standards. For that reason, I welcome the comments of the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. David Begg, this morning in which he firmly rejected a wage-price spiral as in any way being a satisfactory response to inflationary pressures. He is following on what has been the policy of the ICTU for 20 years on this issue. It was adopted in the early 1980s and has been reiterated it many times. I am glad it has been reiterated today.We need to look to the source of any tendency for inflation to continue significantly above the European average and deal with inflationary pressures to the best of our ability because they have implications for a variety of markets and sectors. In reply to Deputy Kenny's question, the difficulty is that if the spiral of wages and inflation rise what suffers most is competitiveness which affects market share and exports and leads to unemployment. That cycle exists in any economy and so is a concern of employers in any agreement re-negotiation. The problem for employers was not wage rates or that there was an argument about what was in the agreement. The problem was that the evidence indicated that we went far higher than the levels set out in the PPF. That was creating a problem for employers  which is why there were negative comments from employer organisations which, in turn, led to responses by trade unions.Whatever else has been said by either side, I take comfort from the fact that the social partners have been careful to acknowledge the very significant role played by our system – the social partnership agreements – in transforming the economy and the social situation. No group has signalled its intention to recommend against entering discussions. I have said to employers and trade unions that they should be careful in their own language and not get themselves into a position where they do not see the benefits. Notwithstanding what happened on 14 December 2000 when there had to be re-negotiation of the PPF, the kind of agreement I seek is one in which inflationary pressures, wage spiralling and competitiveness and fairness to workers and employers are addressed  – one which sticks, not one that leads to pressures. The re-negotiation of the PPF was based on the fact that the economy had grown by 10% that year, inflation rose and was beginning to erode take-home pay. However, that was corrected in succeeding years.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I listened carefully to the Taoiseach who has called for a new programme of partnership between Government, employers and unions. Does he not agree that the evidence shows that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been used as a one-sided weapon to hold down the wages of ordinary workers while allowing the fruits of speculation, rents and prices to rise uncontrolled at these people's expense? In view of his call for a new programme, is he aware that today's leaked report shows that it is precisely the services upon which working people depend – such as those provided by doctors, dentists, pharmacists, those on offer in restaurants and pubs and those provided by local authorities such as refuse collection, in respect of which the infamous bin tax is charged – which have been rising massively?Does the Taoiseach agree that many employers, certain developers and house builders and retailers and service providers are not implementing social partnership but rather are engaged in social robbery? The evidence points to the fact that they are soaking working people for super profits. I do not know how the Taoiseach can deny that fact.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	164	A question, please, Deputy.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Does the Taoiseach not agree that the experience of the past five years – evidenced by rises in house prices, etc. – shows that  inflation is the result of blatant greed by a minority and is not the result of wage demands on the part of workers who are perfectly justified in making such demands in order to compensate for the price rises to which I refer?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	166	As I stated in quite a lengthy reply, it is not in the interests of either workers or employers to have prices, inflation or wages spiralling higher because everybody will lose out. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which is the voice of organised labour in this country, supports that belief and is aware that it is by creating enough wealth and benefits that we can not only pay workers but also create hundreds of thousands of extra jobs. It is also the case that we need to promote the private sector, which creates some resources and ensures that these are shared out.I give Deputy Higgins full marks for consistency because he used to say the same things when we had almost 20% unemployment, massive emigration and when no one was making a profit. I could never accuse him—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I believe it is fair for me to ask Deputy Higgins which way he would like it. Is it not better that workers and employers are co-operating with each other, generating enormous amounts of wealth for themselves, improving their standards of living, the type of housing in which they live and the facilities they operate, generating approximately 800,000 jobs over the period in which social partnership has held sway, bringing in new foreign direct investment and ensuring that many issues on the social agenda which would not have been dealt with have been addressed? Would he prefer it if these people, as was the case 20 years ago, merely shouted at each other? Even the Deputy will agree that it is far better to deal with matters in the social partnership framework. It is for that reason I know that he is even more anxious that we should put in place another programme in order that we can continue to improve the lot of the less well-off in society.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The Minister for Finance has admitted that some increases in taxation may be necessary if Government budgetary targets are to be met. Has the Taoiseach decided what pro posals he intends to bring to any partnership negotiations to allow for the fact that there is no scope for tax concessions?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Those matters will be dealt with as budget time approaches. The process of preparing the budget has only just commenced. When the figures for the first half of the year are published next week and, more importantly, those for the first nine months of the year appear in October, the issues to which the Deputy refers can be considered. However, there is no doubt that the revenues which were growing so strongly in recent years have slowed down dramatically. This means that there are fewer resources available and, consequently, there will not be the same opportunity in the next programme to continue the process, to which Deputy Quinn referred earlier, of restraining wages while providing considerable tax benefits. I do not believe any of the social partners are as much concerned with the latter now because they are more interested in the improvement of services. As far as I am aware, they are close to reaching a consensus on that matter.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I wish to return to some of the Taoiseach's earlier replies and ask him to clarify his position. Is he saying that people working in community employment schemes do not occupy real jobs if they work for non-profit organisations such as day-care centres or bodies which provide meals on wheels? If, as it appears, the Taoiseach believes that the wonderful market economy we possess is so robust and compassionate, does he expect it to provide the meals on wheels services these people provide if, as is the Tánaiste's declared intention, they are removed from CE schemes? Where in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the clause that allows the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or nameless officials in various Departments to unilaterally tear up a commitment to maintain the level of employment in community employment schemes at the rate of 28,000? If that clause does not exist, how does the Taoiseach expect to construct a new agreement if he is unilaterally destroying or reneging on the commitments in the current agreement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I will reply to the Deputy's last question first. There is no such clause. That is why, under the committee on the labour market, the Tánaiste has been dealing with this issue in conjunction with the social partners. There have to be negotiations for anything to happen and that is why there has been communication on this issue. That communication is ongoing.In reply to the Deputy's first question, I was not talking about the individual schemes, I was referring to the people involved. The concept that a person on a social employment scheme has a job for life is not realistic. People want to be employed, but at as good a rate of pay and with as high a degree of permanency as they can  obtain. They do not want to be in a job which will last six or 12 months or perhaps, if they are fortunate, three years. That is not real employment. Our efforts have been aimed at trying to encourage people into training courses which offer them an opportunity to obtain a real job. The Tánaiste would rather give grants to many of these organisations to allow them to employ people on a more permanent basis.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I am a realist. Deputy Quinn and I are aware that the position has changed dramatically and that many services which would have been provided on a voluntary basis when we entered the House would have collapsed were it not for the existence of the schemes.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	181	That is the real point.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	182	We are now moving away from concentrating on the individuals and considering the nature of the schemes. In many instances it would probably be better if these organisations were given grants. There is no need for them to change each year. What usually occurs on a scheme is that an appropriate person is employed and remains on it for one or two years before being obliged to move on. In respect of a number of them, which are quite clearly social schemes and of clear importance to the community, I believe there could be another way of operating.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	183	But no such way exists.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	184	There is no enormous benefit for young people who gain entry on to community employment schemes. When one considers the various schemes, it is easy to identify those which have an ongoing social value. These schemes must be protected, one way or the other. Many of the other schemes have merely appeared over the years and I do not believe they do much service to the people who gain entry on to them.

In addition, certain schemes will now become the responsibility of the Department of  Education and Science and other bodies. I do not see the position changing very much.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Does the Taoiseach realise that the difference in the cost of having somebody on a community employment scheme and paying them the dole is approximately €28 per week? Does the Taoiseach realise that the role of the community employment schemes has evolved from a work programme to a programme of support for voluntary organisations? Services are collapsing because of the actions of the Tánaiste. As an act of goodwill prior to his meeting with the social partners in July to discuss social exclusion, will the Taoiseach freeze the cuts which are severely impacting on the activities and work of so many community organisations providing services such as meals on wheels, services for those dependent on drugs and services for refugees and asylum seekers who depend on CE schemes as a means of coming into contact with and learning the English language? Does he accept that the difference between the cost of a person on a community employment scheme and a person on the dole is about €20 and that the negative impact of these misguided cuts by the Tánaiste at the behest of IBEC is anti-social?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	188	In fairness to IBEC, it is not here to answer the Deputy's questions and I do not believe it has a view on cutting social employment schemes.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	193	That is a matter to be discussed in the standing committee on the labour market, which effectively controls the location of these schemes. The monitoring committees, which have been operating for many years, control where these schemes go. As it is in their hands and not the hands of FÁS, the monitoring committees will control where the cuts will be.

We now have almost no long-term unemployment and there are still almost 30,000 on the schemes. I accept that the areas  they work on have been extended and that a number of these are very useful, but others are not useful. We have to keep the useful schemes in areas where they are of value.

Does the Taoiseach accept that the value of the principle of a guaranteed basic income is very clearly demonstrated by the essential services provided by the community employment schemes? Unfortunately, people on these schemes do not benefit from the increased employment levels to which he just referred and are now being left high and dry. Does he agree that there is a need for a new programme of support – not just grants – similar to the CE schemes which recognises these schemes as jobs and supports the essential services which are being denied badly needed support and are so well appreciated by so many people?The Taoiseach did not answer my original question. He stated that sustainability is a major challenge for us all. Will he live up to that statement by making sure that the partners in the next round of partnership talks will include the environmental NGO pillar? Will he ensure this group is not compartmentalised given that we need to talk about a whole range of sustainability issues?

It is a matter for them to do this, although it would mean moving away from the bodies they work with. They would probably find it more beneficial to stay where they are.I hope the negotiations will start in the autumn, October or thereabouts. There are different finish times for the agreement, extending from the autumn right through to the middle of next year. I understand it will be the autumn before discussions start. As I said, the NESC report, which, as with all the other agreements, will set out the strategy for opening those discussions, should be ready in draft form in July and in final form probably towards the end of September. This should link into the discussions.I am aware of the good work the Northside Partnership does. It could be argued that it is probably the best partnership in the country. It has done outstanding work. As I am not conscious of its current difficulties, I suggest the Deputy raises the matter with the relevant Minister. The partnership does good work and certainly deserves support.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Curricula and syllabi are devised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and approved by my Department. The approved syllabus for a particular subject is issued to schools along with guidelines for teachers which indicate the depth of treatment recommended for the various topics within a syllabus. As part of the in-service programme for teachers which normally accompanies the introduction of a new syllabus, a draft sample paper or sample questions are issued for discussion. The Department subsequently issues a sample paper which reflects the agreed consensus regarding the structure, format and layout of the paper, choice of questions and mark allocation.When an examination paper is being finalised, it is important that the questions are based on the syllabus content. The examination paper in a given year does not ask questions on each and every topic within a syllabus. There are changes from year to year in the range of topics examined and from time to time in the type of question used to examine aspects of a given topic.When the examination is held all observations concerning the examination paper that are received from subject associations, teacher unions, parents, teachers and candidates are forwarded to the chief examiner in advance of the marking conference. The marking scheme is developed at the conference by the examining team drawn from teachers of the subject. In this way, experienced teachers are able to input their own considered views into the framing and development of the marking scheme. It would be inappropriate for me or any other politician to interfere in the work of the chief examiners and the examining teams.The detailed marking schemes for each subject are published and any candidate who chooses to view his or her marked scripts is able to see at first hand how the marking schemes were applied in his or her own case. My Department also publishes chief examiners' reports on a range of the examination subjects each year so as to inform schools, teachers and others about the performance of candidates in the examinations.

This year's leaving certificate biology paper is a good example of what I am trying to explain. The questions on the paper were peripheral to the  course and were not considered to be its main points. How can the Minister ensure that the course taught in each school is the same, that pupils are taught exactly what is on the curriculum and that the examination paper reflects this? The questions may have been on the course but were not taught to the same standard in each school.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The Deputy's question is one for the inspectorate but I can confirm that no question was asked on the leaving certificate examination which was not contained in the syllabus. How teachers choose to teach their subjects is a matter for themselves and for the schools, subject to inspection by my Department. A habit has grown up of trying to predict what is on examination papers. Sometimes this works and sometimes it does not. I assure the Deputy that the papers set for the leaving and junior certificates and for all State examinations contain only material which was on the curriculum and in the syllabus and nothing outside that.

One student who has lived in a French speaking country for 11 years could not understand the French aural tape. It has been widely accepted by both teachers and students that both the halls in which the examinations took place and the quality of the tapes were of a standard different from those used in practice examinations. How does the Minister intend to address this problem in future years?

This is not the first year there have been problems with tapes. I am aware of cases in individual schools in the last number of years but these are taken fully into account. In all such cases the priority is to ensure that no student  is at a disadvantage because of a problem with a tape. I assure the Deputy that this will continue to be the case.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I am aware of the report in question by Professor Pat Clancy, which found substantial variability in the rates of admission to higher education in its examination of admission rates by postal districts in Dublin, with a range from 7% to 77% across the different postal districts. The report concludes that this variability reflects the socio-economic patterning of the population. In terms of admission rates by socio-economic group, the report shows that there has been a significant improvement in the proportion of persons coming from the two lowest socio-economic groups entering higher education as follows:In 1980, only 3% of persons coming from the unskilled manual workers group entered higher education. This increased to 12% in 1992 and 21% in 1998; in 1980, only 9% of persons coming from the semi-skilled manual workers group entered higher education. This increased to 19% in 1992 and 23% in 1998.Part of this increase in admission rates derives from the doubling of the overall admission rate to higher education between 1980 and 1998. However, it should be noted that this latest survey, based on entrants in autumn 1998, is before the significant additional funding committed by the previous Government to further and higher education.New measures have been introduced specifically aimed at increasing access to third level education. There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling €120 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. The provision for measures to promote access to further and higher education has increased significantly from €0.5 million in respect of 1997 to €26 million in 2002.Additional InformationIn line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to  increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.To date, a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report. Special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as top-up grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, have been introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year, with the full rate of the special grant amounting to €3,809. A review of the operation of the special grants has been undertaken by my Department in light of the initial take-up and with a view to extending eligibility.A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. My Department is at present considering a report from ADM on the operation of the fund during 2001-02.Financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. The provision for this fund has increased significantly from €2.49 million in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to €7.49 million in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.I am committed to progressing other recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science.

I am sure we will have a profitable and productive time in the next couple of years.Does the Minister not agree that Professor Clancy's report makes a mockery of the assertion that we have one of the best education systems in the world? Only 7% have access to third level education in the heart of the inner city, the area the Taoiseach and I represent. Cutbacks in CE schemes will affect pre-school and after-school services. Does the Minister not agree that we have made no progress if the participation rates  are worse than in 1992, that all the talk about ours being the best education system in the world is false and that disparity of access in deprived areas has been growing?

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I do not accept Deputy Costello's point that levels of access mean that the quality of our education is less than we claim it to be. I agree strongly that there is no good in having the best education system in the world if not everyone has an equal chance of getting to it. However, I do not agree that we are not making progress in this matter. A number of other things are happening and I intend to continue to underline the importance of equality of access. The action group on access to third level education published its report in July 2001 and proposed a number of measures including special rates of maintenance grants for people in deprived areas. The new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001 and Area Development Management Limited is promoting this in the 37 partnership areas throughout the country. That is significant progress. The money for increased access is there and it is being promoted. We have much more to do in that area and in my term as Minister for Education and Science, I intend to try to ensure there is real equality of access to education for everybody, not just at third level but also from primary level upwards.

Having mentioned ADM, why does the Department of Education and Science not put a representative on the partnerships? Why is there no representative of the Department of Education and Science on the drugs task force? Why will it not send somebody to represent it in the community where the real need is?

I agree that one of the weaknesses of the Department of Education and Science previously has been its lack of a local presence in areas such as partnerships, ADMs, county development boards, etc. It has been addressed in relation to the task force. As a result of the Cromien report, a number of initiatives will be taken including the establishment of regional offices, the setting up of NEPS, etc., which will facilitate greater participation by the Department of Education and Science at a local level.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The current action by the ASTI in relation to supervision and substitution is part of its campaign to have its 30% pay claim addressed.The Government's position on the ASTI core claim is that the benchmarking process is the appropriate means of addressing this issue. While the ASTI refused to participate in the benchmarking process the INTO and TUI took an active part which will result in teachers' pay being fully addressed in the report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body which will be published at the end of this month.A formal offer of €34.28 per hour for supervision and substitution was put to the three teacher unions in October 2001. The offer was accepted by the INTO but rejected by the ASTI and TUI following a ballot of their members. The ASTI issued a directive to its members to withdraw from supervision and substitution with effect from 4 March 2002. The directive applies to supervision at break times and before and after school and to substitution by permanent teachers for absent colleagues. The ASTI central executive also indicated that it would not enter into any further negotiations on this matter pending the settlement of its 30% pay claim.At a meeting of the teachers' conciliation council on 12 March 2002 the TUI and INTO requested that further discussions take place on the issue of supervision and substitution. The ASTI confirmed it was precluded from dealing with this matter but did not object to the discussions going ahead. These discussions commenced on 28 March with the assistance of a facilitator. Following a number of meetings the facilitator issued a proposal on 26 April 2002 for acceptance. The proposal provides for an improved rate from 1 September 2002, further discussions on pensionability and payment for the  current year on the basis of the original proposals.The proposal has since been accepted by the Government and by both the INTO and TUI and payments, where appropriate, will be made for the 2001-02 school year. The terms of the proposal remain on offer to the ASTI. I now ask the ASTI to consider the proposal and put the improved offer to a ballot of its members in advance of the next school year.

Given that it has cost €17.8 million so far for substitution and supervision, can the Minister confirm that this is about €6 million over budget from what was expected? Considering that not all schools have submitted claims for substitution and supervision, does the Minister know what the total cost will be? Has the Minister given consideration to the proposal by principals to look for a once-off payment for the extra work involved for them in light of the fact that there is considerable strain and inconvenience in operating the system in schools?

It is about  €17.8 million currently. Obviously it depends on a range of factors at the latter part of the year, but it will be in excess of €17.8 million. The ASTI made it very clear to my predecessor and the Department that it is bound by a decision and it will not enter any further negotiations on this issue. There is little I can do about that but I have issued an invitation to the ASTI and the other unions to meet me. It will be an informal meeting where they will have the opportunity to meet me and highlight issues of concern and I will do like wise. Those meetings will take place over the next couple of years. I am not aware of any formal claim or submission being made on behalf of the principals, although I am aware informally of talk of once-off payments. We will look at that when it comes to the Department but I do not have anything before me now.

This will be achieved through a multiannual programme to be called the schools' modernisation fund which will be financed through the National Development Finance Agency and through the maximum use of public private partnership arrangements as appropriate. In order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in all schools, my Department has already commenced, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation – including the production of site and building survey drawings and general building condition reports – of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare and the compilation of the resulting information on a geographic information system database.Work commenced in January 2002 and each school in the pilot area will be surveyed by suitably qualified personnel who will assess and report on site conditions, space norms within the schools and the overall condition of each school. Ultimately, all the data accumulated will be stored electronically on the GIS database and will be used to prioritise capital funding for first and second-level projects. The pilot project is expected to be completed by September 2002 and it is intended to use the experience gained in the  pilot phase of the project to expand the inventory nation-wide. The proposed standards will be largely based on the planning guidelines for primary and post-primary schools currently used by my Department.

Over 800 schools have already been identified as being substandard and will cost in excess of €500,000 for renovation. The works required are basic and would ensure decent health and safety standards for students. Such works involve toilets, combating dampness and refurbishing inadequate buildings, etc. The Minister's Department has not outlined any timescale for effecting those works. The Minister is now kicking to touch again. There will be a fresh inventory and survey and we do not have a clue when this will happen.

That does not mean that all building work is going to cease and wait for the inventory to be completed. Almost €184 million is available for second-level schools capital this year alone and almost €173 million is available for primary schools capital. There is a deficit, there is no question about that. I will not claim that it will be wiped out in my first year in office. A national development finance agency will be put in place and will give us the opportunity to have multiannual programmes which will allow us to plan the programme better than is the case now. The Deputy will be aware of the public private partnership schemes we have in place. The first batch of secondary schools in the first phase of the PPP are well advanced. I intend to introduce a series of measures such as standardising designs, using multischool campuses, devolving responsibility and funding to schools of four classrooms and less for upgrading and additional accommodation, and a more open tendering process. These strategies are being put in place to tackle the real needs that exist. The primary and post-primary schools building programmes are at historically high levels and I hope to maintain that level of expenditure over the next five years.

Perhaps the Minister would care to outline why this backlog has been allowed to increase? I know it was not done in his time, but it was done in his predecessor's time. I would like him to give the House some information about the national development finance agency. This seems to be the goose which will lay the golden egg and solve all the financial problems but it has not had any funding  as yet. It seems it will operate through public private partnerships. What level of public private partnership is going to take place in our schools? Are we going to be in hock to the private sector for education delivery in the future.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	251	As long as the schools are delivered I have no ideological hang-ups about whether it is done by the private sector or anyone else. My main concern is to provide a level and standard of accommodation which is fit for pupils and serves the education system.In 1997, when the previous Government came to office, £44.3 million was allocated to the primary schools building programme, it will be almost €173 million this year. Similarly, £48 million was available for the second-level schools building programme in 1997, but it is €176 million this year. There has been a very significant increase in expenditure. There was a very significant deficit there because of the large jump in the number of students attending school after the introduction of free second level education. The type of schools that were provided were not up to the required standard and we are now paying for it.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The National Educational Psychological Service was established on 1 September 1999 and is an executive agency of my Department. The development plan for NEPS provides for a gradual expansion over a period of years, with the number of psychologists in the educational system increasing gradually to 200. Notwithstanding the time-consuming nature of recruitment competitions for professional staff, there are now approximately 100 psychologists in the educational system, including 86 psychologists in NEPS – double the number that were in the post on establishment date.The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission has now completed the selection of a further 69 psychologists for NEPS. It is envisaged that almost 40 of these psychologists will be in post by the end of this year and the process of clearing and calling the remaining psychologists on the panel will then go ahead. NEPS has delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students in primary and post-primary schools and in certain other centres supported by the Department. Provision of assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in NEPS.The educational psychologists in NEPS address the need for psychological assessments in the schools they serve and also provide advice on the identification and screening of children who might need to be assessed. It will take some time for the backlog of assessment work to be dealt with, but good progress is being made. The psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are worked through in order. Each psychologist is responsible for a number of named schools and visits each on a regular basis. The school authorities provide names of children who are giving cause for concern and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist's visits. That allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in weeks, if not days. Where cases are less urgent, the psychologist will, as a preliminary measure, act as a consultant to teachers and parents, offer advice about educational and behavioural plans and monitor progress.Of the 86 psychologists currently working in NEPS, 13 work exclusively in post-primary schools. The majority of psychologists, however, provide a service to all schools, primary and post-primary, within a specified geographical area. This allows for tracking children, particularly those with special educational needs, from one school to the next.Additional InformationThe number of national schools served by NEPS has now increased to almost 2,000. As each additional psychologist is appointed, more national schools will be added to the NEPS list until all have access to the service. Pending the expansion of NEPS to all schools in the country, my Department has allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools and has made recommendations to top management in the Department in relation to the enhancement of the scheme during the coming school year.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I wish the Minister well and hope he will be pro-active. We will challenge him at every opportunity to do a good job as the country needs it. Does the Minister agree it is strange that he cannot tell us the level of need in schools for psychological assessments? That question has been asked on a number of occasions, but we always get the same reply. I am disappointed the reply is a repeat of a reply given a couple of months ago. Has the Minister any idea of the level of need? Does he agree that there is a two year waiting list in many schools for psychological assessments of the needs of four and five year olds? It is causing stress and strain among teachers, parents and small children. Can the Minister find out the level of need and inform the  House as soon as possible? It should not be difficult to do that.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The need for psychologists and improved and increased psychological services was recognised by my predecessors. As a result, NEPS was set up and given the task of supplying psychological services to primary and post-primary schools. It is estimated that the psychological service, NEPS, covers approximately 2,000 primary schools in the system at present. The Deputy may be aware that there are approximately 3,172 primary schools in the system. I referred to the waiting lists in my reply. There are not any waiting lists. The service is provided to everyone who needs it within those schools. I do not anticipate that I will be in a position to give the Deputy such information at any time in the future.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Does the Minister agree it is a mess? If he wants to plan for a psychological service in our schools, he must have some idea of the need. It cannot be that difficult to ask the psychologists to give the Department and NEPS a list of their case loads. Is the Minister aware that in many schools children have been waiting for more than two years and that it is causing hardship? What will he do about it? Will NEPS have its full complement of psychologists by the end of this year as guaranteed by his predecessor?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	256	My aim and that of NEPS is to provide a psychological service to every school in the State. Where individual assessments and urgent cases need to be looked after—
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	257	They are all urgent.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The Minister should tell that to the parents.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Cases of urgent need are dealt with within weeks or days, if necessary. The psychologists serving the schools give the necessary advice to both parents and educationalists. The aim is to provide a psychological service which covers all the schools in the State. I outlined at the outset that there are 86 psychologists working in NEPS and another 40 will be employed before the end of this year. That is in accordance with the aims and the plan which has been put in place to provide a proper service.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	261	That concludes priority questions. We now move on to other questions. I remind the House that supplementary questions are limited to a maximum of one minute and the replies to these questions by the Minister are limited to one minute.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I am aware that most teachers retire before attaining age 65. The tendency of teachers and other public servants to retire before compulsory retirement age is one of the factors which has contributed to increased expenditure on public service pensions. Another major factor leading to increased expenditure is that average life expectancy is increasing. It was principally because of the rising cost of public service pensions that the Government decided in 1996 to establish a commission to review and report on the existing provisions for public servants. The proposal that a standard retirement age of 65 be introduced for new entrants to the public service, including teachers, is one of the recommendations contained in the commission's final report which was published in January 2001.The Government has accepted the broad thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has established a working group to advise on the implementation of the commission's recommendations. The working group, which consists of representatives of the public service unions, including the INTO and TUI, and relevant Departments, including the Department of Finance and my Department, has met on a regular basis and it is hoped the group will be in a position to report before the end of the year. The operational details of the implementation of the commission's recommendations will be determined by the Government following receipt of the report of the working group.The report of the commission records that the three members who were representatives of the public service unions were unable to agree with the recommendation that a standard retirement age of 65 be introduced. They accepted the desirability of increasing the age at which public servants would actually retire, but they felt this should be achieved by providing incentives for staff to stay in employment, for example, by being able to accrue more than 40 years' service for pension purposes. The reservations expressed are being considered by the implementation working group.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Does the Minister agree that it was misguided to have a standard retirement age of 65 given that 80% of primary teachers leave  before that age? Why is a standard being introduced which cannot be implemented? Teachers are voting with their feet as there is an exodus from the teaching profession. There is a broader issue to be dealt with in terms of the resources to schools, pupil teacher ratios and pupil behaviour. Why is a standard retirement age being introduced when 80% of teachers are leaving voluntarily, as a result of illness or for family reasons? It is in stark contrast with what happened a generation ago when teachers applied for extensions beyond 65 years of age. There is something seriously wrong with the primary education service.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	264	It is not my place at Question Time to give my views or opinions on anything. I am giving my official position as Minister for Education and Science. I will talk to the Deputy afterwards about it.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I would like to hear the Minister's views.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Is the Minister concerned about the stress felt by teachers in schools? Does he believe that is a factor in the exodus of teachers before the official retirement age?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Stress is a factor. One can see that from the figures for the number of people who leave teaching before the normal retirement age. All the studies would indicate that stress is one of the factors affecting health. Sometimes the ill health is brought on by stress and sometimes it is not related but there is no doubt that it is a factor. Teaching is a very onerous and responsible job and it is not getting any easier. I am certainly interested in trying to advance anything we can do to relieve the stress involved in teaching. Stress is probably as much a result of changes in society as of changes in education.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	268	In view of the already low take-up in terms of teacher training places and the stress involved in the job, to which the Minister has referred, does he agree it would be a detrimental step for the educational system to force teachers to remain until age 65, without their goodwill?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	269	They will still have the option of retiring before age 65. What we are discussing here is really a public service retiring age. If I read the figures before me correctly – and if I am mistaken I will correct them later – it appears that, in 1986, 44% of teachers who retired had reached the compulsory retiring age and that the figure for 2001 was 19%.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	270	My Department operates an aid for schoolbooks grant scheme at primary level. The purpose of the scheme is to alleviate the costs of providing school textbooks for eligible pupils in primary schools. For the purposes of the grant scheme, an eligible pupil is defined as a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances – such as substance abuse – which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship. My Department issues an annual circular to all primary schools and, through the principal teachers of individual schools, invites applications for assistance under the scheme. Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way, under the terms of the schemes, based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.A consultancy report, which was submitted to the Department in 1993, dealt with the factors that contribute to the cost of school textbooks. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of schoolbooks to parents. The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible. For this reason, enhanced grants are paid to schools that operate book rental schemes. At primary level, in 2002, a total of €3,679,000 has been provided towards the aid for schoolbooks grant scheme. I can assure the Deputy that, in the context of securing additional resources for the primary education sector, the question of increasing the resources available to this grant scheme will be considered.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Does the Minister agree that the scheme is in need of review, considering that what is now in place is a pool of money for which a principal teacher in a particular school submits an application and that the amount of money disbursed depends on the number of applicants? Does he agree that that can result in an individual pupil in a particular class in a given school getting less than what is required for a single text book and that the cost of text books is quite exorbitant, especially in view of curricular changes? Does he agree that needy pupils in deprived areas require a far greater amount of money for text books? While I applaud what the Minister has said about the rental scheme, greater funding and a more generous approach is required for needy pupils. Will the Minister consider reviewing the scheme?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I accept the Deputy's point that the scheme could benefit from a review. However, my first priority is to try to secure increased resources for the scheme and I am sure the Deputy would support me in that regard. In addition to the particular aspect to which the Deputy referred, there are other things which need to be looked at. There are six different rates of payment in relation to the grant scheme and I believe that could be reduced. While I am favourably disposed towards a review, my priority over the next few months will be to get increased resources for the scheme. After that, I would have no objection to reviewing the scheme and how it operates. No doubt, a committee on education and science will be established in the near future and perhaps this is one of the topics we should discuss at an early date to see if there are ways and means of improving the scheme.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	273	Perhaps the Minister would bring some imagination, innovation and, even, courage to this matter. Would he agree that the fact that text books change so frequently is a problem? The fact that text books are so heavy is a serious problem which needs to be addressed. Does the Minister agree that a move to a modular system would be desirable, whereby books could be divided in chapter form so that only the required chapters need be carried to school every day? This would also facilitate sharing of books and thereby cut the cost. Will the Minister consider an innovative solution which would reduce the weight of school bags, a major problem in itself, which one of his predecessors – the Minister before last – identified but failed to resolve? Will he give a commitment to examine this with a degree of courage and innovation and come up with practical solutions that will actually work? He should tackle the publishers.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I hope the Deputy might acknowledge that, in my previous ministerial position, I showed a certain amount of innovation and courage but I may not always have received the support I would have liked. Perhaps I will get support from across the floor of the House this time. The suggestion of presenting text books in modular form is certainly an interesting one. I acknowledge that, because of changes in the curriculum, text books are changing and becoming more expensive. That is a serious concern. However, I believe the book rental scheme is one of the best ways of assisting pupils and it has worked extremely well in other areas. If we are to have a review and take suggestions on board, we should have a good look at the book rental scheme with a view to encouraging more schools to avail of it. I am not sure what the uptake of the scheme is in disadvantaged areas but we should set out to make it very attractive for as many schools as possible to participate.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Work on the establishment of a National Council for Special Education is at an advanced stage and it is my intention to bring this body into being by ministerial order under the terms of the Education Act, 1998. I have also indicated my intention to restore to the legislative process the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002. This I will do in the autumn following the continuation of consultation with interested parties throughout the summer. This legislation will, when enacted, establish unequivocally that the special education needs of children must be met as a matter of legal right. The establishment of the National Council for Special Education will be central to translating these rights into reality on the ground.This council will have two broad functions. First, it will be responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for children with special needs. In particular, the new council will have the capacity to co-ordinate special needs education provision at local level and arrange for the delivery of agreed educational services. This will be achieved through the employment of a network of special needs organisers who will act as a single point of contact for the parent of a special needs child with the clear and specific objective of delivering for that child those educational services to which he or she is entitled. Second, the council will be responsible for carrying out research and providing expert advice to my Department in relation to special education issues. The council will also be responsible for putting in place an independent appeals mechanism open to parents unhappy with the educational provision proposed for their child.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I expect that the council will take the approach outlined by the Deputy. At present, the special needs organisers have a role in bringing together the various services so that the full needs of children can be assessed. Once assessed there should be a single point of contact to respond to the needs. The delivery of services at local level is part of this. An aspect of the present difficulty is that my highly centralised Department is trying to provides services at a local level through local schools. There is a lack of overall co-ordination. Despite the worthwhile  efforts of various officials in the Department, there is a need for a more local focus. Greater co-ordination is possible. Apart from the gaps in the service, there is probably a high degree of overlap. In view of this, the Deputy's suggestion will be part of the new arrangement.

Will he assure the House that he will secure the necessary resources to provide for what is one of the most neglected areas of education?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	279	In 1998, the Government decided, during the term of office of my predecessor, that, following assessment, the provision of whatever education facilities for children with special needs was required would be almost automatic. That remains the policy. I have been in receipt of correspondence outlining the delays in some areas, nevertheless, it is the policy to try to provide for those with special needs almost immediately. This will be accelerated following the establishment of the national council, which will also provide a focus point. Much as the situation has improved over the years, the national council will ensure considerably greater improvement. It will have the funding to do that.

Will the Minister indicate if it will be given carte blanche to make any relevant decisions that will ensure the provision of a better service for parents and those living with people with special needs, including those suffering from Asperger's syndrome, dyslexia, autism and attention deficit disorder? At present pupils are experiencing problems in getting a special reduced student rate for the use of a city speed bus, the No. 25X, to attend Catherine McAuley school for dyslexia in Baggot Street. Given the funding to be made available to the national council, how many local centres will it be allowed to establish?The Minister indicated that he will reintroduce the persons with disabilities Bill. Will he assure the House that the valid comments on the Bill made before the general election by parents and those with disability will be given full consideration when it is reintroduced?

In response to an earlier question, I indicated the roll-out of psychologists under NEPS. I understand there will be a further 69 appointments before the end of  the year, in addition to the current complement of 80. That is not a full and final roll-out.

With regard to the reintroduction of the people with disabilities Bill, a consultation process is ongoing. I understand officials in my Department have received submissions from a variety of groups. A number of constructive suggestions for improvements to the Bill have already been made, some of which I understand we will be in a position to facilitate. When the Bill is restored to the Order Paper in the autumn, I will ensure that the amendments accepted by us will be published to enable those interested have a full picture of what is envisaged.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	288	There was a growing sense that the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas had outgrown the financial and control structures with which it had been endowed at the foundation of the State. The former Chief Whip and present Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was exploring with his counterparts what accelerated reforms would have consensus support and I am aware that other parties were teasing out the implications for their members of scenarios for possible change. Sufficient agreement existed on what should be done for members of the Public Accounts Committee sub-committee on certain revenue matters to sketch it out in its first report published in December 1999.I and my Cabinet colleagues were also conscious of a widespread feeling among Members  of these Houses that our Parliament was under-resourced in terms of facilities which Members thought were not merely desirable but essential in a modern Parliament exercising its constitutional function of supervising the Executive. I cannot help feeling that this is connected with a little-remarked change in the character of Dáil Éireann in the past decade or so. We now have a House where experience of Government office is more diffused among its parties and Members than was the case previously and there is, I believe, an anxiety to put that experience to work more effectively in the business of the Oireachtas. The cynical may see this as a case of poachers turning gamekeepers and, having resumed their old career, wanting to have any perk or facility the gamekeeper enjoyed. I do not and cannot see it that way.We were also very much aware that a view was widespread here about the levels of staffing available to the Houses. These views were reinforced by increasing contact between Members of this House with other parliaments – be it the European Parliament; parliaments of other EU states or other countries with governments and systems similar to our own. Any Minister for Finance has a natural distrust of international comparisons because he finds them used by every pressure group, trade union, sectional interest, even his colleagues, to prove that in comparable countries whatever service they are involved with costs more, has much better paid staff, more sophisticated equipment or is manned by several times the number of staff deployed on it here. Often when these stories are checked the facts turn out to be very different. Nevertheless, I was persuaded of the desirability of having the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas commission an international benchmarking review to provide an international comparison which took account of differences of function and culture on resourcing and staffing levels required for the proper functioning of a modern parliament.My hope was to have this study to hand earlier this year but it took longer than expected to agree the terms of reference and modus operandi governing the study. These were not concluded before last summer's recess and, as a result, the study started late. The report from that exercise, which came in two parts, has just been finalised and will enable a realistic figure for staff and support costs, either arising from the Civil Service staff, or the staff made available directly to Members to be computed in a realistic manner on the basis of an objective study. The staffing levels recommended will be included in the sum incorporated in the Bill to meet the expenses of the commission going forward.I mention the international benchmarking exercise for two reasons. First, it shows that significant work has been done on a new configuration of institutional support for Members in their vital tasks and, second, because it has an important bearing on the core of this Bill. The central figure of this Bill is just that – a figure,  an amount of money which should appear very clearly in section 5 of the Bill. That figure was, and still is, to be agreed with the Ceann Comhairle and, once embedded in this Bill, it will when enacted and brought into force be available to the commission as a matter of right to meet the current expenditure costs associated with running the Office of the Houses of Oireachtas. It is the amount the commission can charge on the Central Fund over the period provided in the Bill, namely three years. Once embedded in an Act, neither I, the Government nor any Minister for Finance can reduce, increase or renew it without coming back to this House and having an Act passed. It is important to emphasise that these arrangements relate to current, not capital, expenditure.As I said, that sum is intended to last the commission for three years following which there will have to be another Bill and another agreement, with a new amount and a new timeframe established. Some concerns have been expressed at the prospect of having to enact new legislation every three years and the ensuing media attention to which this would give rise. Where moneys are a charge on the Central Fund, I believe it is appropriate that the overall service be comprehensively reviewed periodically. We do not know what new expenditure requirements might arise or what levels of expenditure the commission might consider necessary on existing services. This Bill provides for an amount of money to run this institution and when that money runs out new legislation involving a fresh allocation negotiated for another period will be needed. If, because of recess or rigidities of Oireachtas business, this cannot be done, authority is provided to the commission to draw on, as a holding operation, one half of the amount provided for in the previous year. A comparable arrangement applies to the spending of voted moneys in advance of the Estimate being passed.Initially, the general scheme envisaged the expenses incurred by the commission being a charge on the Central Fund for a period of three to five years. I believe that it is prudent to provide for a limited period of three years at the outset. This can be revisited when the legislation is being formulated for the next round of funding. There may be a view among parliamentarians that these arrangements could be simplified by allowing the amount to be updated from time to time by way of statutory order. There are two points regarding this matter. While I am confident that the arrangements set out in the Bill are eminently workable, we are moving into uncharted waters about which some people outside these Houses may be sceptical and experience of working the new system may throw up practical issues which require some fine tuning. Second, I believe it a healthy proposal that this House should have the opportunity to have an in-depth discussion about the funding of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas every three years or so.I had hoped that, at this stage, we would have a definitive figure incorporated in section 5 but it is impossible to arrive at a realistic figure until the effects of implementing the international benchmarking recommendations are incorporated into the office's costings. That exercise started much later than intended and has only just been delivered. It is not permitted to have a section in a Bill with a blank area marked "to be inserted"; for this reason we have, as a holding operation, provided a notional figure for three years expenditure. This will be replaced by whatever sum is agreed between myself and the Ceann Comhairle before Committee Stage. The findings of the international benchmarking review will provide the primary basis for this figure.I do not like to convey the impression that apart from the end of the three year period, or the money, the commission will be out of the public eye. Each year a member of the Oireachtas commission, or a Member of the House nominated by the commission, will under section 13 of the Bill present to this House a statement of the expenditure by the Houses showing how a portion of the overall sum provided by the Oireachtas in the legislation will be spent in the following year. Instead of being formally granted by a Vote, the Estimate will be taken note of by the Dáil. The purpose of this is twofold – it keeps the Houses of the Oireachtas informed and the statement of estimated expenditure for the following year's budget is then passed to the Minister for Finance to allow him to include the amount in the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure. This will replace the current procedure whereby the annual Estimate is presented by the Minister for Finance.The other major element in the Bill is the proposed commission which will take responsibility for the organisation and staffing of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It proposes that it will have 11 members, all but one being Members of the Oireachtas. These are: the Ceann Comhairle as chairman of the commission; the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad; the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas; a representative of the Minister for Finance, who will be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas except during periods of dissolution; up to four representatives of this House to be nominated by this House or a committee established for this purpose; up to three Members of Seanad Éireann to be nominated by Seanad Éireann or a committee established for this purpose.The philosophy underlying the Bill is that the governance of the Houses of the Oireachtas should rest with the Members of those Houses. What this effectively does is to provide the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas with a commission which will have the managerial role which Ministers have in their individual Departments. Indeed, it will have a wider role, in that the commission, unlike Ministers, will not require the Minister for Finance's authority for the expenditure incurred under the provisions of this  Bill. With this in mind, the only non-parliamentarian to be a member of the commission will be the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Clerk of the Dáil, in his capacity as Secretary General of the office and, in effect, the commission's chief executive. The selection of the seven ordinary members is a matter for each House and there are a variety of ways in which this could be done but it is for each House to decide how they are to be chosen. The remaining parliamentarian is to represent the Minister for Finance. I want to emphasise that, having eliminated the Minister from his traditional control role in regard to the office, this is not a machiavellian plot to reintroduce him by the back door. The representative is there to represent the Minister because of his role in relation to the Central Fund, public service remuneration and Civil Service matters which impinge on the Office and Members; and his continuing role as the sponsor of legislation on Oireachtas matters.The Bill proposes the Ceann Comhairle as the automatic chairman of the commission. It has been argued that the commission should appoint its own chair. However, having considered this question carefully I am particularly conscious that the Ceann Comhairle has traditionally been the public face of the Houses of the Oireachtas and is also accepted as being free of party ties in the discharge of his existing functions. These are desirable characteristics in a chairperson of the commission. I also believe that the separation of the Ceann Comhairle and commission chairing roles could give rise to difficulties centring on clarity of roles. These circumstances have convinced me that the Ceann Comhairle should be ex officio chairperson of the commission and section 7 of the Bill provides accordingly.The Bill also deals with the arrangements which affect Members during a dissolution period, as well as the removal and resignation of Members. In essence, when a Member ceases to be a Member of the House which appointed him or has ceased for specified reasons to have its confidence, he or she leaves the commission. The same applies to the Minister's representative. During a dissolution the Chairman of each House remains in place until a successor is appointed and a temporary Minister's representative who must be a Minister or Minister of State may be appointed.I am aware that some Members have expressed concern about the proposal to provide for dismissal of ordinary members of the commission. While I can well understand concerns about ill-founded allegations having detrimental effects on persons in public life, I cannot visualise a situation where either House could not remove a commission member which it had appointed having formed the view that he or she was culpable of stated misbehaviour. Accordingly, the Bill provides that an ordinary member can be removed because of incapacity, stated misbehaviour and to facilitate the effective functioning of the com mission, but only on a resolution passed by the House which appointed him or her.When this Bill was being prepared for publication, I was insistent that the explanatory memorandum accompanying it should set out in some detail what the provisions in each section did and also a brief summary of the underlying principles. I did this to ensure that from the launch of its text, Members of this House had a very clear idea of what it contained and to avoid the risk of the Bill being misunderstood. Having done so in that document, I am not inclined to repeat the exercise in section by section tutorials. However, there are a few matters which may require comment.The Bill envisages the transfer of various functions from the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for Finance to the commission. In this way the commission shall determine the funding, staffing and organisation of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is proposed that the Minister for Finance will retain powers in relation to the rates of pay and allowances of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and in relation to rates of pay, allowances and certain gradings of the officers and joint staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. These relate for the most part to Civil Service wide linked grades. Otherwise, the commission shall have responsibility for the funding and staffing.Some changes have been made to the Bill since it was circulated at draft stage. The initial scheme provided for the commission coming into being by way of resolution of the Dáil and Seanad. Legal advice suggested that this procedure was not constitutionally essential as the functions of the commission were administrative in nature and did not impinge on the business of the Houses regulated under Article 15.10. The advice also suggested that the right which either House enjoyed to amend or rescind any resolution could at some stage bring about a situation where resolutions and the Act were in conflict and cause serious problems in the management of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. In these circumstances, section 3 proposes that the commission shall stand established when the Minister for Finance makes the necessary establishment order.One of the functions ascribed to the commission is to provide for legal advice to be made available to Members and committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of the business of the Houses. Currently when legal proceedings are being taken on foot of actions by either House or by Oireachtas committees it is necessary to name individual Members of such committees in any legal proceedings. This provision makes this unnecessary and allows the commission to be a party to such proceedings where the authority to do so is provided by either or both Houses.This Bill involves, as I have made clear, handing over virtually all the functions of the Minister for Finance in regard to staffing the office to the  commission. I will retain responsibility for pay and pension matters affecting both Members and staff. Under section 12 the commission is required to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance if it wished to create posts at or above principal – higher – level. The main grade above this level in the Civil Service generally is assistant secretary general of which there is a relatively small number and it is important that no local arrangement should lead to any dilution of the quantity and quality of work normally attaching to those posts. It is my intention to operate this unusual arrangement by sanctioning such posts as I have ascertained to have the same level of ongoing work as the generality of such posts in the Civil Service.It has been a fairly regular occurrence for Ministers for Finance to come before the House to sponsor legislation affecting Members or their Houses. Much of this has been concerned with the bread and butter issues of pay and pensions. Some provided Members with immunities they needed to discharge their public duty or imposed obligations on them in regard to ethics requirements and electoral financing. It was rare for my predecessors to deal with matters so fundamental as recasting the organisational framework within which the Houses of the Oireachtas function. I feel very privileged to be the Minister for Finance given the opportunity of introducing legislation which will transform the conditions under which we and our successors as Members of this House can work for the betterment of our nation. I commend this Bill to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18000	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in seeking to improve the operations of this House. No doubt he has taken the side of Members at times when it has been neither popular nor profitable.This Bill will potentially improve the operation of the House. It is certainly welcome that we would have a self-governing commission and that you, a Cheann Comhairle, will be at the heart of that. It is important, as the Minister stated, that we would be seen to have independence from the Executive in the way in which we organise our business and it is very important that we set about being professional in what we do.I was a little surprised that the functions set out for the commission are somewhat anodyne in their nature in that it just makes provision for services and facilities. I would certainly have liked to have seen some reference to best practice and improving standards against the benchmark of other European countries set out in the various reports which have come to hand. Perhaps that is quibbling about the nature of the Bill in that at the end of the day it is the commission which must define itself by the way it conducts its business.I have only had an opportunity to read the second of these reports. I am not sure whether the first one is available. Perhaps it is, but I have not read it. However, the extent to which  Deputies find that they are working in a very unprofessional environment is revealing. There is – I can speak from personal experience – very little support to spokespersons for the main political parties in seeking to prepare amendments and to prepare for debates, and by the nature of the way this Parliament works spokespersons carry a great deal of the burden of preparing for those debates. It was interesting that 88% of Deputies use the research facilities which are now available in the Library, but 45% of them rated them poor and 24% rated them fair. Therefore only a tiny proportion rated them as either good or excellent. That tells us much about the nature of the support to which we have become accustomed.The benchmarking exercise was also interesting in that when it looked at the number of researchers available to the Houses, it showed that in Ireland there are three available to the 166 Members, whereas in Northern Ireland, which has a smaller Parliament, there are 28; in Scotland, 42; in Wales, 10; and in Finland, 15. In Germany, it appears there are hundreds because every member has a researcher as well as the houses having about 60. These figures speak for themselves.It is significant that Deputies rate the research facilities as very poor in the general work of the Oireachtas but on the occasional instances when we have investigative inquiries, like in the case of the DIRT or mini-CTC inquiries, the rating of the resources available to the House has dramatically improved. In those cases, most of those who have participated regarded the support as either good or excellent in the case of legal and technical support, and perhaps not so high in some of their other areas – but certainly a very high rating. The opposite is the case in the ordinary committees, with very few rating the facilities.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18000	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Therefore there is a huge distance to travel in order to make up lost ground.When we come to Committee Stage and the Minister has run the slide-rule on the assessment of what is best practice and how Ireland should square up to it, we will have an interesting debate about the type of budgetary envelop presented by the Minister and the basis on which that is to be developed. The Minister has stated in the explanatory memorandum that this research will form an input, but he did not give as much inkling in his Second Stage speech as to how precisely the envelop would be arrived at. I know there is already evidence that different Members have different views on both the location and scale of the research unit and the extent to which there should be constituency officers as against research support. There are many issues on which Members will want to hear a fairly open and transparent debate. Will the Minister bring forward some tentative proposals, perhaps well  before Committee Stage, so Members will have the opportunity to note the direction of the thinking that underlies the budgetary framework for the three years going forward?I am not familiar with the arrangement of three year block grants. However, it seems fair to the Houses of the Oireachtas that, if it transpires that the budget, although run efficiently and within the Minister's pay rates and conditions, runs ahead of what is expected, the Minister will make a reasonably generous provision to allow that continue and for a new Bill to be prepared without the Dáil running into difficulties doing its work.On the wider issue of Dáil reform, there are 16 Members who are among the elite. The 149 others, excluding the Ceann Comhairle, are in the peloton. We have to get up and cycle up and down the slopes for many hours every morning. The reward for our effort in terms of influencing public policy is extremely minimal. I am not referring to financial reward, but our capacity to influence the way in which this Dáil operates. If the Government does not develop a much newer and more radical role for Deputies over the coming 12 to 24 months at the same time as giving us financial independence, it could mean, ironically, that this Bill will add to public scepticism and the view that we are independent in terms of our conditions of employment, albeit not our pay and expenses, and that we are part of a cosy club.People want to see real reform matching the new independence of the House. While I commend the Minister for giving the House independence in running its financial resources, if we do not also start on a very realistic and much more ambitious programme of Dáil reform than we have seen to date from the Government side, we will disappoint those who regard this Bill as a step forward.It is disappointing that we have come back into this Dáil and still do not have a new approach to raising relevant issues in a meaningful way each day. It was expected that Deputies from all sides, whether Independents or members of parties, would have the opportunity to raise relevant issues each day, but that has not happened to date.We have also seen in the past 12 months – Deputy Howlin will be much more familiar with this than I am – that the courts have stripped the Dáil of important powers of investigation. It can be argued that some of those investigations veered too far in the direction of drawing conclusions concerning what probably were offences. Equally, the court rulings swung dramatically in the other direction and have curbed our powers of investigation to a remarkable degree. It will be very difficult to frame serious investigations in the future that are confined, as the courts now seem to be saying, to pursuing legislative issues or holding the Executive to account. It seems to leave a very large grey area in respect of our powers to investigate the workings of semi-State  bodies or to draw conclusions on foot of investigative work that we undertake.It is a pity that the Government has been silent to date. I certainly have not heard any view from it that we need to reinstate the important power of investigation on behalf of the Dáil and the committees it establishes.The Government won a vote this morning by 30 votes, but its majority, the largest in over 20 years, is extremely comfortable by historical standards. It is time for the Minister and his colleagues to be courageous in respect of Dáil reform.I have been in this House for quite a long time and I cannot see why we cannot debate the budgetary framework now for next year, before the Minister gets into detailed negotiation with his Cabinet colleagues about their Estimates. The framing of the budget is our business. We are the elected Members of this Parliament. We have a right to know much more about the outlook for 2003, to participate and hold the Government to account in a meaningful way using full information. We have a ridiculous tradition that this information is not revealed until a day or two before the budget and we create an artificial high noon, of which I know the Minister is critical, but we still have not moved sufficiently far down the line.Why should we not have the power to veer money from one Estimate to another or within an Estimate? It is not meaningful that we do not have the power to move money around and draw a conclusion. If we are to have stronger and more meaningful committees, we must be willing to give committees the power to say, "Perhaps the Minister has got the health priorities wrong for 2003. The Dáil would like to seen things done differently. We would like to see more money provided for people with disabilities and less money in certain areas of acute medicine." I do not see why the Dáil could not have that sort of opportunity to debate.Why should Ministers not be able to present heads of legislation to the Oireachtas committees at the time they are agreed by Cabinet so that Oireachtas committees can conduct meaningful negotiations with lobby groups and interested parties who want to see legislation accommodating their needs? Why hold discussions in private with lobby groups completely outside the glare of public attention? Why have lobby groups pulled Ministers aside at social functions to present their cases? Why not allow such discussions to be transferred to an open, all-party committee which can debate these issues openly? This would allow the lobbyists to act in a serious and open way. That is the direction in which we should move.The Dáil should have its own parliamentary office of investigation so that, far from being curbed in respect of investigative powers as has happened in the past 12 months, it could have new capability for investigation. Many would regard the tribunals of recent years as evidence of the incapability of the Dáil to get its act  together and to conduct investigations in a timely way. As a result, we have had to engage in tribunals, which have been enormously expensive to the taxpayer.Perhaps it is too simplistic to say that the DIRT inquiry showed how powerful Parliament can be because many of those involved came in with their hands up, which would not necessarily be the case in other investigations. However, we need to expand greatly the capacity of the Dáil to undertake serious investigative work which is what the Dáil does best. Politicians are best at scrutiny. They are better at this than, as happens in many cases, acting as the token councillor or parliamentarian on a board. It is preferable that parliamentarians hold those who have responsibility for spending money to account in a meaningful way. In many cases, that necessitates powers of investigation that go well beyond that envisaged by the courts at present.I do not see why the recommendations of all-party committees should not be given far greater status by Government. Since the committee system started, I have been a rapporteur in several studies – on educational disadvantage, illiteracy, science in education and public transport in Dublin, to name but a few. In no case did the relevant Department say that the all-party committee recommendations were worthy of serious investigation and that it would deal with them and report back in a specific period, nor did it offer its views as to how many of them it would take on board.Oireachtas committees are viewed with contempt by Departments and Ministers are happy to allow that system continue. It is a make-work opportunity for Dáil Deputies to have them as rapporteurs. There is no serious intent on the part of the Government to do anything because all the parties of the House are combining to say that something needs to be done about educational disadvantage. Some of those proposals were very radical, yet none has been adopted.There is a belief in Departments that what the Oireachtas and the committees do is of no real relevance to them. Unless the Secretary General is called to account they pay no heed to what goes on. This must be changed and a practical way of doing this would be for the Government to say that the recommendations of an Oireachtas committee will become policy unless a motion to the contrary is submitted. That would not bind the Government – it always has a majority – but would give an opportunity for real debate about the committees' reports. If recommendations were offered it would be up to the Government not to accept them and to debate in the House its reasons for not doing so. That never happens.In this day and age we should be escaping the notion that parties can freely put political hacks onto boards. We should tell the Oireachtas committees that they have the power to scrutinise ministerial appointments. In the interregnum between the last Government and this, even though it was the same Government, I saw people  who in my view were unacceptable being put on boards. These people were party hacks with no experience relevant to the work they were being given. Even the great whistle-blower on the other side, the side from which one Member is here, did not say this was unacceptable. The Oireachtas committees are the ones who should blow the whistle. It is unacceptable to have people from the other side of the country, with no relevant experience in a task, being appointed to a board dealing exclusively with Dublin-related matters. The Minister of State knows the board to which I refer. It is ludicrous. The Oireachtas committees should be regarded as an important gatekeeper, keeping watch on the standard of appointments the Government makes. We are elected and we have that right.It is hypocritical for the Government to talk about wanting to see legislators taking their jobs more seriously. The Government perpetuates the system in which Deputies effectively have fewer powers than a county councillor. I have more powers on Dublin City Council than I do here. I can actually get things done there. I cannot get things done here although I can recommend things that are never done. The 150 Members who are not members of the Government, in the hope that we may one day be part of the charmed 16, have allowed our wings to be clipped. I hope that the appointment of an independent commission is not just about freeing financial control from the Minister for Finance but also about taking the fetters off Deputies and allowing them to act as an independent power that can do things to make this Dáil relevant. We are dependent upon the Members on the other side of the House. They have a substantial majority.This is a second-rate Parliament. That is the reality and we are suffering the contempt that goes with it. Our colleagues in the media are crammed to the rafters to see what we have to say about the future of the Oireachtas commission.

We need, as a group of 166 people, to get our act together and decide what will benchmark Dáil Éireann against best practice in any parliament in the world. We are unacceptably far off the pace. No trade unionist, lobbyist, IBEC or Small Firms Association member who wants to see Government policies change will turn up to Oireachtas committee meetings except out of courtesy. They come because they are asked. They do not come because they believe that this is the throbbing centre of power where public policy is being moulded and shaped. They do not believe that this is the place they should be in order to see policy becoming responsive to their needs. They simply do not see things that way and we have allowed that to happen. We have allowed social partnership to expand to fulfil roles that should be here in the Chamber and in the workings of the Dáil. I do not wish to criticise  social partnership but to say that we have failed and that those people are filling vacuums that we created.Even when we pass this Bill, we will not have arrived. We will only have made a very tentative start on a journey. If we want to see a strong, relevant Dáil we must ensure that we no longer see its influence eroded and that we start to reassert ourselves as the primary source of authority for the 16 members of Government and beyond. Ironically, it is the 16 members of Government who suffer because of the way in which we have allowed our powers in this House to be curbed. Once the centre of authority and decision-making shifts from inside the Chamber to the Departments and the partnership networks, the authority of the 16 men and women who sit around the Cabinet table is also eroded because their ultimate authority derives from the extent to which they have influence in this House.I make an impassioned plea to the Minister of State and to the Government, which has a comfortable majority, to take its courage in its hands and start to do the things I outlined earlier. I have no doubt that other Deputies have many other ideas but we need to start the process of achieving not only financial independence but also the creation of a real parliament that is relevant and can demonstrate to people that it can make changes to make their lives better. Sadly, many of the electorate have lost their faith in us and we are seeing the consequences of that in the declining number of people who bother to turn out for elections.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I am privileged to be in the House not only for the introduction of this important legislation but also for the very thoughtful contribution we have just heard from Deputy Bruton. He made some extremely important points about the function of these Houses about which I have my own strong views. There are two Opposition Deputies in the House, nobody in the press gallery and a junior Minister on the Government benches – with all due respect, a junior Minister who is relatively new to the operation of these procedures and has yet to find his way in terms of the functioning of the Houses. I have lobbied for a long time for this debate and for a fundamental change in the way this House does its business and demands its place as the cornerstone of our democratic accountability. We have absolutely surrendered that to a variety of other institutions.I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and I wish him every success during his term of office, but I dare say he will learn that he probably had more influence as the leader of a farmers' organisation in shaping national policy than he will have as a junior Minister in this House. That is a fact which we must address collectively and not pretend to deal with. The introduction of this legislation is a very considerable start. It is a milestone and I heartily welcome it,  but it is nothing more than a building block in a process with which we must either engage or not. The Bill provides a statutory framework for restructuring the operation of the Oireachtas. How radical that restructuring will be depends on the performance and the membership of the commission. There is no doubt that the manner in which the Oireachtas currently operates is in need of radical overhaul. Deputy Bruton said little with which I could disagree.Two key reports have been published in the past two years – the IPA report on the future operation and development of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which was published and available to Deputies, and the Deloitte & Touche report of March 2001. There was a two-year gap between the publication of those two reports. Both highlight the inadequate current funding and supports available to the operation of these Houses. I heartily agree, a Cheann Comhairle, with comments attributed to yourself when you stated in the final report of the Committee on Members' Interests produced by the Deloitte & Touche investigation that: "we have a seriously under-resourced parliamentary system". You are right and no one who tries to operate here would disagree with that.We must decide for ourselves if we are collectively going to make democracy work in this society and bring it back into these Chambers. We are all guilty in this because, as Deputy Richard Bruton rightly said, for 30 years up to the previous general election, Governments changed at every general election and those of us in Opposition had expectations that we might be in office. The notion that the Executive was in every sense the Government and Parliament and wanted to be as unaccountable as possible was the rule of thumb. The more authority that was devolved to a questioning Parliament, the more bothersome Government became, and that was something to be resisted.We had an interesting few years in the previous Dáil. The issue of investigations is one example. I do not know of any parliamentary system which does not allow for parliamentary investigations of public administration. Some do it with great effect, such as the American system where a Senate or Congressional investigation has enormous clout and the same authority as a High Court investigation to summon witnesses and papers, to take evidence under oath and to hold people in contempt for either false evidence or refusing to give evidence. Britain has a very effective parliamentary investigative system as well.We have had experience of three committees of investigation in the previous Dáil. I was a member of one, namely, the sub-committee on Abbeylara. The High Court and Supreme Court judgments on that investigation bear interesting reading for us. There will always be a point of tension between the Oireachtas and the Judiciary in terms of the scope of powers. As I pointed out in an article in The Irish Times yesterday on  another matter, most actions of public administration are justiciable in this democracy and that is as it should be. It is up to us all to live within the law and to apply constitutional justice in dealing with any matter which falls to us, whether as parliamentarians, administrators or members of Government.There is also a greater good, namely, that of society as a whole which appears to be being squeezed by the inexhaustible right of the individual. It is the shape of our times that the individual has so many rights that society in general is crushed into a smaller space and has lesser rights. Individuals in such circumstances, therefore, will always be in a position, especially if they have resources, to perhaps trample on the greater good. It is the fundamental role of a parliamentary democracy to represent the greater good. Getting that balance right is a challenge for us. I do not have any magic formula for it, but I know in terms of the investigative work done by the sub-committee on DIRT and attempted by the sub-committees on mini-CTC and Abbeylara that there is a space within which parliamentary scrutiny must be defined and allowed to operate.I wish to comment briefly on the issue of resources for the Houses of the Oireachtas. For the past four years, I was justice spokesperson for the Labour Party. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the previous Dáil generated more legislative proposals than any other Department. There were 40 items of legislation across a range of diverse issues. We do not have resources in the Opposition to do the research and analysis.There is also an enormous amount of secondary legislation, some of which was on the Order Paper today, under Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty which requires parliamentary scrutiny. This deals with justice matters which often have significant implications for the rights and privileges of citizens of the State. We do not have any input into those nor do we have any briefing in terms of their discussion and evolution within the European system and COREPER. They are largely handled by civil servants and, when they are agreed by Ministers, are presented to us for rubber-stamping. Even that is done with contempt.I have had rows with various Departments over the years but especially recently with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about secondary legislation, which has been debated and examined for months within bureaucracies, being held in the Department for months, presented for a short period in the Oireachtas Library and torpedoed into the House, often to be rubber-stamped without debate. We allow that to happen because we are overstretched and do not have any resources to get researchers to advise us. Often when one has five different items of secondary legislation as well as an Adjournment Matter and normal legislation to deal with, it is the line of least resistance to agree to the secondary legislation being taken without debate.  One knows one does not have the physical energy and time to do the scrutiny one would wish for.That is wrong and fundamentally undermines our democracy. We need to do something to address that and I hope this framework will allow that process to begin. I hope it will allow proper resourcing of research and support so that when Opposition Members discuss legislation, they know the background thought processes and where the international experience came from to allow them question in a meaningful way the proposals coming from the Executive.Sometimes it does work and the experiment in the previous Dáil whereby committees allowed external submissions before legislation was taken on Committee Stage was a good model. One example with which I am familiar was the decision of Government, which is still current, to transpose the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law in a narrow and limited way. I resisted that. One way the committee got a broader view on it was to invite submissions and we received scores of them from external bodies who wanted to express points of view.The one with the greatest impact was from the new Human Rights Commission and its president, the eminent jurist, former Justice Barrington, who put a compelling and devastating case against the Government's proposals. Those measures have not been proceeded with, although I understand they may well emerge in similar form again. That is a different battle. To have the facility for that external scrutiny and for people with expertise to analyse legislation in public is a tremendous broadening of the scope of Parliament and a very good development.What Opposition spokespersons often have is submissions from vested interests. One often depends on such submissions and one has no way of investigating or evaluating them. One may use them if one wants or one may not. We need to be more professional if Parliament is to be meaningful. Otherwise the Executive will continue to keep the functioning of Parliament as restricted and limited as possible.I wish to discuss briefly the contents of the Bill in specific terms before I make a few general and broader points. We will propose some minor amendments on Committee Stage. Apart from that, the Labour Party strongly supports the Bill because it provides a comprehensive, coherent and progressive framework for the development of the Oireachtas and gives the Houses an independence in their funding and organisation, one of our greatest deficiencies to date.Members of this House fall into different categories. When one examines the record, there were Members of this House who did not see legislative involvement as being a critical part of their work. Indeed the general public do not regard legislative work as being particularly critical because, as Deputy Bruton will testify regarding his former front bench colleagues, some of the most hard-working Members, incisive thinkers and best debaters in the last Dáil lost their seats.  Other people were elected, and it is invidious to even contemplate naming people, but they see their role, not as legislators to table an amendment or contribute a Second Stage speech to a Bill, but as agents of their constituents to deliver whatever is available from the national cake to them and address their concerns like some sort of ombudsman. They are often the Members who are most secure in each election and that has a salient message for us all. The reality for most Members is we must try to do both. At least those of us in the Labour Party must try to do both as there is an expectation that we will do the constituency work while the majority of us have front bench duties too. This is an extraordinary burden to carry and is something we cannot continue to do in a meaningful way without much greater support than that which is currently available.The Bill provides that organisational and operational freedom be given to the Oireachtas through what is the cornerstone of this legislation, the Oireachtas commission. The membership of that commission, proposed in section 8 of the Bill is: the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, the Chairman of Seanad Éireann, the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas, a member appointed by the Minister – which explains why he wants that – and not more than seven ordinary members; four Members of the Dáil and three of the Seanad. The one non-parliamentarian proposed is the Secretary General of the Oireachtas to whom I spoke to and I hope he does not mind my saying so. My view is that the commission should be comprised exclusively of Members of the Oireachtas. There should be a working group to the commission which would implement its administrative decisions but no other person other than a parliamentarian should be a member. This matter should be considered between now and Committee Stage.Section 4 of the Bill details the proposed functions of the commission. Deputy Bruton suggested that they were rather inane but I think they are broad enough to stand the test. Section 4(2)(d) states that “The commission will determine, subject to the consent of the Minister in respect of a person engaged in the provision of secretarial facilities, rates of pay, conditions of employment and pension rights”. There are other sections in a similar vein: section 12 deals with staff employed by the commission and, for example, gives the commission the right in section 12(3)(e), where it considers it appropriate to do so, to recommend to the Government the dismissal of an established civil servant employed in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. These are new and onerous responsibilities to give to a group of parliamentarians and we need to be careful about how we select the people to do this work. I hope that at least one member would have industrial relations skills as that would be important.One of the most important sections of this Bill is section 5, which deals with the critical issue of  funding. There is no specific final figure included – the figure is a no-policy change issue. I have some experience of dealing with Estimates in two big-spending Departments and I understand what "no-policy change" means. It means that one starts on the current base. If we are to be radical in terms of resourcing parliament in a way most people would like and giving the resources and ability to do something more meaningful to Members, we must be realistic in the acknowledgement of the additional resources that are required.I argued for some time that all the Votes that are discussed in the House, whether for the Department of Health and Children, Department of Defence or Department of Education and Science, should have a champion in a Minister at the Cabinet table who can argue for his or her Vote. The Oireachtas has never had that because the Minister for Finance carries that brief and he has other things to do. He was not a champion of the Oireachtas in arguing for the Vote so the role of the commission is in freeing that up and creating an independent champion to argue for what we need.I understand that the Minister cannot be explicit in terms of what will be provided but I hope he will go further than he did in his Second Stage speech in addressing some of the important matters such as what shape he sees the staffing and supports that would ideally be available to Members of the Oireachtas taking? Where does he stand, for instance, on the Deloitte & Touche report? What specific supports would be available? Should there be different supports for front bench Members? How would we organise research and support? Should it be through an enhanced Library available to all Members or should they get research assistants? Should there be a significant increase in the supports available in constituencies? These matters should not disappear as debate material for the future. I would like the Minister to have formed a view that he can put on the table and with which we can engage on Committee Stage. If that cannot be done today, it should be done when we return to this Bill.In Schedule 2 of the Bill, there is a comment in relation to the right of the newly established Oireachtas commission to the sales of televised proceedings of Dáil and Seanad Éireann which raises the issue of how the Irish people see our Parliament. There is an Oireachtas committee on broadcasting which Deputy Séamus Brennan chaired from 1997 to 2002 but I am not sure what has happened with that committee, what reports it has published and what it has achieved. We currently do ourselves an injustice in terms of the way we present what goes on in the Houses.When we debated digital television, it was argued that we would have a dedicated channel for public service broadcasting to include excerpts from the Dáil, focus on certain issues and comment from parliamentarians to liven up the way these Houses are presented to the public. The era  of terrestrial digital television is disappearing further and further away as is the option of having a dedicated television channel for the Oireachtas. With all due respect and absolute regard for the people who present "Oireachtas Report", they strike me as having all the resources that used to be available to the "Garda Patrol" programme. That is not the modern way. If one looks at the BBC programme presented by Andrew Neil on the operation of the British Parliament one can see someone engaging with the parliament rather than simply showing snippets of who said what. It is about bringing the issues of the day to life and having a studio debate. That requires resources but we have stopped taking control of these issues.Many moons ago, I was involved in the debate on the televising of the Houses. At that stage we considered the position of C-SPAN in the United States, which is a channel dedicated to public and parliamentary broadcasting. However, all of that appears to have gone into abeyance. We need to consider how we present ourselves and how we can ensure that our deliberations are given a better time slot on national television. Deputy Rabbitte has previously stated that the only people who watch "Oireachtas Report" are drunks and insomniacs because it is on at such an ungodly hour. We must also consider how we construct our debates and how we can make the Parliament more meaningful. We should be given air time not only on television but on radio.The Oireachtas should have its own staff who would be charged with the role of making this place more relevant to people, of making suggestions, of challenging us and making the type of programmes to which I refer. None of that appears to be a reality at present. The old adage that has always ruled the roost here is that the Executive wants strong Government and weak Parliament. The weaker the Parliament is, the stronger the Government can be.I understand there are ongoing discussions between the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Department of Finance. The conclusion of those discussions will be essential in terms of whether this framework proposal will be perceived as being really not meaningful or whether it will come to be a critical milestone in changing the functioning of this House. I am advised that the key remaining concerns which exist between the staff and the Department is that the legislation should provide for the provision of funds for essential services for the Houses of the Oireachtas and that core parliamentary services – such as parliamentary questions, the Bills Office – should not be diminished by competing resources for other areas of parliamentary activity.There is a suggestion that there should be a linked annual inflation rather than a rigid funding mechanism such as that provided in the Bill. We should set the base at an agreed level. I understand that it is envisaged that discussions on this matter will be confined to the Ceann Comhairle  and the Minister for Finance. I hope, however, that this will not prove to be the case and that Members, in the broadest context, may have an input. Once we agree what is a reasonable base, we could then put in place an annual inflator in order that the type of exigencies that squeeze budgets could not squeeze the Parliament which, if we want it to be, is the bedrock of our democracy. Alternatively, we could allow what has happened incrementally in recent years to continue, namely, we can become less and less relevant. Some people, including certain members of the Executive and those in particular Government Departments, want it that way. They believe the real business is done outside, through social partnership and holding great summits around that nice white table in the Sycamore Room in Government Buildings with the television cameras rolling. They are of the opinion that we should make this House less relevant. One day, that will be the rock on which we perish.Ministers more frequently make announcements outside the House than they do within it. There have been umpteen examples of Ministers – I cannot say the word "lie"– engaging in obfuscation when replying to parliamentary questions because they have made decisions they are going to announce a matter of days if not hours later at some grand functions in Dublin Castle or at some other external forum where they can present their message in whatever way they see fit. The respect that once existed for this House is diminished on every occasion we allow that to happen. The Ceann Comhairle has a real role and responsibility to set standards which ensure that parliamentary questions are rigidly answered and that where there is an obfuscation or inaccuracy or where decisions have been made and we are not informed about them because Ministers want to make announcements elsewhere, people are held accountable.I have already stated that I am of the view that the Secretary General should not be a member of the commission. I understand that a suggestion has been made by the staff side that there be a board of management which would work to the commission. Such a board would provide a proper medium through which the Secretary General and others could play a role. I understand this principle works in other parliaments, the operations of which have been considered.One could speak at great length about this important issue. I heartily welcome the Bill as a significant advance in providing a framework for making Parliament meaningful for all of us and attractive to those who will not stand for election because they can have more influence on public policy by not being Members of the Dáil. We have an obligation to ourselves, our citizens, our democracy and our founding fathers to make this place work to the optimum. I hope Government will engage in the Opposition in shaping a framework for this Dáil that will be a model of which we can all be proud.

I wish him well and I thank him for the courtesy he has extended to me and to other new Members. It is deeply appreciated. I also congratulate Deputy Parlon on his deserved appointment.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	297	There is a contrast between Deputies Howlin, Richard Bruton and I because, being a brand new Member, I see things differently. As stated previously, people have asked me if I am sorry I was not here 20 years ago. In some ways I am, but it has happened the way it has happened and I am proud of the way I got here. I was elected 39 days ago and I have only been here three weeks so I probably have a different perspective on the House. I notice not everyone does it, but I have spent some time trying to balance my days by listening to the debates and the perspectives on offer. That is important and I am not ashamed to say so.I have known and admired colleagues over a long period and it is important that we all understand each other. Whatever about the need for party politics – I accept that this will always exist – one of the things one learns in the House is that one gets the opportunity to work with people who, even across party lines, one admires. It is important that the public is aware of that. If, as Deputy Howlin stated, we are concerned with perceptions, the public must understand that there is a serious side to this House and that people have an opportunity to work with each other on behalf of the community. As far as constituencies are concerned, I work across party lines in South Dublin County Council and Dublin County Council and I am certainly going to try to do so in this House. If that is unheard of, I apologise for it. However, I believe that is what people in my constituency of Dublin South-West desire. They want to see co-operation between Deputies Rabbitte, Crowe, Conor Lenihan and myself. We must do the job with which we are charged, but people expect a certain degree of co-operation between us. I hope this can happen.I hope he will not mind me repeating it, but Deputy Howlin, when he was Minister for Health, appointed me to the board of Tallaght Hospital. I know he was criticised by his party at the time, but it was a good decision. What I am saying is that there are those of us who have taken some time to come through the system. I  know that not everybody in my party will accept what I am saying, but there is a certain amount of truth in it. The public would understand politics and what politicians are trying to achieve better if there was more co-operation. I hesitate to use the term, but people do not want to see the nasty side of politics. It is the side they see and hear and they do not like it. It is a pity they do not have an opportunity to spend more time in this House and that a process cannot be found to allow them to see what really happens here in terms of good decisions, good contributions from across the parties and attempts to make things better in all our communities, whether in Wexford, north Dublin, Tallaght or other parts of the country.The Bill to establish the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to take over the day to day management of the House is to be warmly welcomed. As somebody who has only been here for a few weeks, it is important to point out that I have already experienced the professionalism and support of many of the staff who work to deliver an effective service to Members.I hesitated about coming into the House. Members will remember my good friend, former Deputy Chris Flood, who I was lucky enough to replace, for the fine contribution he made. I recall he asked me at 10 a.m. on the Monday before the first sitting after the election if I had been in Leinster House. When I informed him I had not, he told me I should go to the House to get a sense of what had been achieved, meet colleagues, hear what was being said and meet staff. That first day was like being at school – in fact, it was like sneaking into school before it started. It has been important for new Members like me to get to know people and find out how helpful staff are at every level. Perhaps colleagues who have been here for many years tend to become more cynical, but I have enjoyed the welcome I have received.The ever changing role of the Dáil in serving the electorate requires the ability to be pro-active in responding to and managing these changes. This is best served when business decisions can be made quickly and in-house knowledge and experience is available to remove and pre-empt difficulties. With regard to the functions of the commission, I have no doubt I speak for all my colleagues in saying that its Secretary General will have an effective lobby group on his side when negotiating and agreeing the expenditure budgets with the Department of Finance.Without wishing to upset anybody, it is a pity the traditional title of Clerk of Dáil Éireann appears to be a victim of the Bill.

With regard to the composition of the commission, the number of members, at 11, is adequate. I would have liked the membership period to be shorter than the lifetime of the Dáil. Appointing members for 18 months would allow  more Members to contribute to the commission and understand the scale of activities covered in the day to day operation of the House.

I seem to know everybody in the House and I apologise for it. Will you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, write to the few Green Party supporters in Tallaght to inform them that I have co-operated?I welcome the commitment in the Bill to consult Members to ascertain the level of resources and staff necessary to meet the needs of the House. I request that this activity be done internally by administrative staff and that we do not engage, if it is planned, the services of an outside consultancy. An internally managed consultative process will be a useful opportunity for the commission to take a hands on approach, make decisions, stand over them and not use external reports as a way of side-stepping issues. I also ask that the partnership process is engaged in order that staff at all levels are made fully aware of the changes and are invited to make a significant input into the consultative process.I have several observations on the issue of the facilities provided to Members. I was first elected to Dublin County Council, which was then located in the city centre, in 1992. Later, I was elected to South Dublin County Council after it moved to Tallaght in 1994 and have represented the people there since. Throughout that period I took the view that I needed to make myself available, not only in the normal manner, but through several weekly clinics and meeting the demands of the electorate by attending community activities and the main functions which take place in a major population centre.I thank God I was elected to represent a Dublin constituency as I am not sure how I would cope as a Deputy for even Wexford, not to speak of Cork or Limerick. We have to take account of certain demands placed on us. I have experienced a massive increase in voter contact during the past month, both during and especially since the election. People thought I had been elected before the event, but since the election the increase has been huge and manifests itself in many different ways. I still receive calls from people asking if I have left Tallaght because I have not been seen for a day. Presumably, other Deputies have to deal with the same challenge.

I admire my colleagues from the country. Getting to Tallaght eight miles away can be just as difficult as getting to Wexford or Cork. There have been huge demands on my time and constituent contact has increased. Nevertheless, while I find the challenge different, I am delighted with it. As I go around Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue and Tallaght, I find I have to become more professional than ever. Providing a professional response will require the assistance of the new commission. I look forward to inputting suggestions on topics such as IT equipment and communications systems which, I hope, will allow me to manage an active constituency office in Dublin South West. I have no doubt many Members will be seeking similar assistance.I find that following up requests, advising constituents, attending community events and, in due course, preparing for committees, together with reading Bills and researching for debates such as this, provides me, as a new Member, with the challenges that my experience in local politics will allow me to meet and overcome.Without the facilities provided by the House, a professional and sustained constituent customer service and Dáil performance would not be possible. While my parliamentary career will, in time, be decided by my constituents in Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills and Tallaght, where I live, their response to my work starts here. I am delighted to support this legislation. I look forward both to listening to the remainder of the debate and to the progress of the Bill, which would be in the interests of all Members and the House.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I compliment the previous speaker on his address. He was very forthright and incisive about how he finds Leinster House. The procedures for new Members have changed somewhat since I entered the House in 1989 and probably a great deal since Deputy Howlin was elected, which must be decades ago at this stage.I am glad there are initiation procedures for Members and instructions on how everything works. I hope this follows through to all the parties. On our side we are trying to help new Members to find their feet.I welcome this Bill and I compliment Deputy McCreevy, on the work he has done as Minister for Finance and on the way he has helped Members to do a better job. New Members, including Deputy Parlon, would be astounded to know that when I became a Member of the Oireachtas in 1989 my office was in Merrion Street, outside the perimeter of Leinster House. Members occasionally missed divisions because the division bells did not always ring. We shared offices and even when we moved into better offices we had only one fax machine per floor. We had very few facilities. Various Ministers for Finance gave us concessions and Deputy McCreevy has been excellent. As a member of  the Members' Interests Committee I record my appreciation of his response to Members' requests for better facilities.Before the last Dáil went into recess a Member, who was not re-elected, remarked that, no matter who was in Government after the election, every Member of the House hoped that Deputy McCreevy continued to be Minister for Finance because he had looked after Members. Deputy McCreevy has been excellent and we should remember that.The Deloitte & Touche report, which looked at international benchmarking procedures in relation to Members' services, has been very worthwhile. The report contains some worthwhile recommendations and others with which I do not agree. My major concern with the Bill concerns the commission's budget. I note that its budget is to be decided by the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance and will remain fixed for three years. The budget will cover the running of the House, but under what terms? Will the House be run as it is now, in terms recommended by the Deloitte & Touche report or in terms laid down following further discussion with Members from the various political parties.The Deloitte & Touche report recommends an additional 20 researchers in the Oireachtas library. The library staff are very helpful and co-operative. They do an almost impossible job. I am sure they receive calls from every Member looking for material on various subjects. An additional 20 researchers would make life easier for them. However, this is not the way forward. Deloitte & Touche set out the ways in which the additional researchers should be deployed. The report recommends that research areas should be organised according to "specialisms" and suggests five "specialisms" covering areas such as economics, social issues, health, education and international affairs, with each "specialism" shadowing three committees or so. In the period before the presentation of the budget I might ask a library researcher for material on the budget. If, for example, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, asks for material on the budget will he receive the same package as I do? If every Member is given the same material how do we put our own identity on it. Each Member should have his own researcher-manager.Things have changed dramatically in the few years I have been a Member of this House. It was interesting to hear Deputy O'Connor saying that since he was elected there has been a huge increase in the number of calls he receives. What Deputy O'Connor has experienced in recent weeks is small compared to what he can expect in the future. He will receive an ever-increasing volume of material. The public have become more demanding and want a virtually instant response on all kinds of complex queries.How do Deputies balance their local commitments to constituents with their duties and responsibilities within the House? Local issues  were of huge importance in the last general election. Candidates who ran a good constituency office and responded to constituents were far more likely to be elected. Almost every Deputy wants to be re-elected. We therefore need more help at constituency level to answer our constituents' queries. Should we provide resources to Members in their constituencies or provide better resources in the House? Each Member should be provided with an additional researcher-manager. We must strike a balance between our commitments in the House and in our constituencies.I am my party's deputy spokesperson on finance. When the Finance Bill is published later in the year we will spend a week in a committee room debating the Bill on Committee Stage. None of this will be reported in the media and our constituents will not be interested in what the committee is doing. Will more Members commit themselves to scrutinising legislation, which should be our primary function, or will we be more concerned with dealing with our constituents' problems with a view to being re-elected? In the general election a number of Deputies were defeated by candidates from their own parties. Deputy O'Connor spoke of his activities and hard work in his constituency. Is there someone already queuing up behind him?

Deputy O'Connor says people in Tallaght are already asking him if he has left them. Is it right that someone can come in behind him and exploit the fact that he has responsibilities here?We must look carefully at the structure of Leinster House and at our commitments in the Oireachtas. Perhaps we should examine the issue of the dual mandate, now that we have lost the influence of the great man from Kerry who had such an interest in those issues but who is not now so influential. Maybe this is something that should be revisited by the Government.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	310	Within the set up budget, other issues need to be considered apart from what the Deloitte & Touche report says about services to Members. What about committees? How will these be serviced adequately? In the past, clerks of committees have tried to do their best with very limited resources. When Members look for back-up research on the Committee Stage of a Bill, the resources are not there. In preparing the set up budget we must decide if we are to properly resource the committees. Even the Deloitte & Touche recommendations state: "these specialisms should shadow three or so committees." At the last count there were 15 committees of the House. What will happen to  the other ten? Are they irrelevant? What happens to them? We must decide if we are to provide proper resources when giving input to the set up budget.I had the privilege of being chairperson of the Committee on the Family some time ago. We had an excellent clerk, Pat Timmins, and a limited back-up team. We worked for two and a half years, got submissions from the public, etc., and did a tremendous amount of work. We were absolutely hamstrung in relation to the amount of resources we had. As chairman of that committee, I was sickened that the then Government, which comprised my party and others, set up an outside committee to look at the family. Because that committee was departmentally based, it got unending resources from the Departments. However, a committee of the House composed of parliamentarians had damn all to spend on research, etc., which was not right.I welcome the provision in the Bill that money will be available for legal advice. So often committees get bogged down over the legal advice and we cannot get it. We must discuss how we will go about that. Should we have budgets to bring in outside legal advice at appropriate times or should we have legal experts that are associated with the various committees? I am aware that within the staff of the House there are people with legal training. Perhaps we should beef up their contracts so that they will be able to provide that kind of legal advice.To a great extent the Minister is giving a free hand to the commission to decide on most things it wants to do within the jurisdiction of the House. However, it cannot appoint a person above the level of principal officer. If we are to need people with particular expertise, maybe we will need to go higher than that to get the right person. It is an imposition within the legislation that perhaps should not be there. If the Minister is to hand over responsibility to the Houses of the Oireachtas for doing its own business he should not claw back responsibility for this and I ask him to reconsider it.What about the proposals to restructure the Dáil and the way we do our business? Many people talk about the need for Dáil reform, but it is not clear what kind of Dáil reform is being proposed. We hear discussions are going on within various committees on proposed Dáil reform. What will be the impact on the financing of Leinster House if we have real reform? Many things need to be discussed and changed, some of them very radically, but there must be adequate discussion and negotiation with the staff, Members and the various political parties. What will be the cost implications for those? Are they to be included in the new set up budget costs?Resourcing of spokespersons is another major issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who is in the House, can call on all the resources of his Department to help him prepare a speech to give in the Dáil. Opposition spokespersons of all  parties operate to a great extent on their own. I was a spokesperson at one stage and the amount of back up I got from party resources was virtually nil. As a result we depend on the goodwill of friends and advisers, whom we ask to help in reviewing legislation and other topics. It is not good enough that opposition spokespersons have to rely on such help if they are to scrutinise legislation properly. We must consider how opposition spokespersons are resourced. That must be separate from their membership of the Dáil. If an ordinary Member is allowed an additional researcher-manager to help him or her, then the spokespersons need somebody in addition to that. I am always wary of giving additional staff to parties because often they get absorbed around the party leader and very little benefit accrues to ordinary Members within the party. This needs to be discussed and agreed at an early stage.The commission will have full responsibility and resources to pay the salaries and expenses of the Members of the House. That is worthwhile and I hope it works well. This will highlight a further anomaly that exists already, which will not be rectified. From time to time, under the Freedom of Information Act, various newspapers seek to get the expense accounts relating to the Members of this House. There is one new Member here this evening who has probably read these in the newspapers in the past. There are 166 Members of this House, but when the expense accounts are released they relate to only about 125 Members because Ministers and Ministers of State have expense accounts based in their Departments. Thus it may appear that a Deputy McGrath from County Westmeath is getting a certain amount in expenses. A Minister, on the same list, who might be based in that constituency, is shown to be getting a fraction of the expense that I am getting. On reading this, the public wants to know how the Minister can do so much around the county when all the other Deputy does is to draw expenses. It is unfair and needs to be changed. If expenses for Members of this House are to be published, all 166 Members should be treated equally. The 32 people on the Government side should not be in the privileged position that only some of their expenses are published.It does not make for a level playing pitch. While I see my good friend and colleague Deputy Browne smiling, perhaps he was not too happy when he saw the discrepancies occurring when there were Ministers in his constituency during the last regime.

Not having been a Member of the House previously I cannot assess that properly but I would have some experience having been a researcher for my party. I have seen the evolution of services to Green Party Members over the last couple of Dála. There has been an undoubted improvement in the standard of services available to Members. Congratulations need to be offered on those grounds.This Bill is sincere in attempting to improve those facilities further and to bring about a better organisation of how the Houses of the Oireachtas are run. However, it is unfortunate that it seems to be a managerial approach to how the system of running the Houses can be looked at. I would like to have seen a wider philosophical attempt at increasing the effectiveness of how the Houses might be run. Maybe this is something that could be looked at on Committee Stage, the Bill might be better for it.In the past it was not unusual for my now party leader to share an open plan office with a secretarial assistant, a researcher – which the party would have provided from its own resources – and latterly a press agent. It was not an ideal working arrangement but things have evolved. Members now have individual offices, secretarial assistants are in adjoining offices where available and that improvement is to be welcomed. New Members have experienced some teething problems and we are still trying to sort those out with the authorities in the House, particularly the Whips office. I am sure these problems can be resolved. I am grateful for the ongoing assistance that has been offered by the Houses of the Oireachtas staff in making sure that new Members are aware of what is available. In that regard I do not think there is a lot that needs to be changed in the working of the House and we should be looking at better ways of rewarding those who bring about the smooth operation of the House.I would like to see a deep examination of some of the more mysterious aspects of how the Houses of the Oireachtas have evolved. I would like to see why there might be resistance to adopting necessary changes that reflect a modern 21st century Parliament. It strikes me that some of the rituals, habits and paraphernalia are very much rooted in the 1930s. While the Dáil in the 1930s played a very important role in evolving democracy in this country, it is not necessarily the best system going forward. There is a reluctance to use technology to a greater extent to improve our stature and the way we do our work. The electronic voting is an undoubted step forward and I look forward to the time when we can use it – I hope it will be soon. Other parliaments have gone even further. The idea of using information technology by having desk monitors in parliaments is useful for instant information retrieval in debates. Other speakers have spoken  about the resources available to Opposition spokespersons compared to those of the Government. If we were to use information technology in an imaginative way, many of those problems could be overcome.The Minister makes specific reference to how the management system of the commission should be structured. I can sense this Bill was largely drafted before the election. We must acknowledge that not only are we living in a new Ireland following that election, we are living with a new reality in this House where the political structures have undergone a massive upheaval. I do not believe the number of Members' representatives proposed for the commission – who will have the largest interest in the smooth running of this House – is reflective of how this House is now constituted. There are a number of political groupings and I would like to see the Bill amended on Committee Stage to properly reflect that. It is no secret to any Member that there is an ongoing dispute over the Standing Orders and how they should be changed. I can sense there is a degree of impatience from the more established political systems with a longer history of membership in this House. As much as we feel comfortable with how things have been and how things are, we must be prepared to embrace change to bring about a more efficient and better working relationship. This Bill is only about adjusting the paraphernalia of the business of the House rather than deeply examining what the House is and how it can operate better.I hope to see the Government addressing the idea of having a more interactive Parliament, but I do not have too much confidence in that. I would like to see legislation, especially that which is not of a financial nature, coming from all sectors of the House. I would like to see a greater use of Private Members' legislation and the use of the Law Reform Commission to overcome backlogs in the legislative process by producing finished Bills that can immediately be inputted into the workings of the House. That would lead to an ongoing legislative programme to which all Members could relate.We must also address the way we structure our business. This Parliament meets less than probably any other in Europe and that is not satisfactory. It is very much hamstrung by British parliamentary procedures of the last century and is very male oriented and anti-family in how it structures its business and its timing. As a result, we suffer in the composition of the membership and the number of people who can confidently put themselves forward for election to this House because of what are seen as archaic barriers to being a proper Parliament of the people which would involve people in the decision making of this House. I hope attention is paid to the Second Stage debate and that appropriate amendments are tabled on Committee Stage. If the Minister does not do that, the Green Party will do it. I hope we can vote on a Bill which improves the workings of the House.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I welcome the Bill. I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here because I want to compliment him. It is not often that a Minister is complimented by the Opposition, but he sees the issue from all sides. He spent a long time on the Opposition benches. There was a time when he thought he would be appointed a Minister, but the plug was pulled on him. He did not forget the Members the day he was elected. I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, on his appointment and I wish him well. He has always been a kind and courteous person in the House. I hope he does not forget the Members on the opposite side of the House, like other Ministers did when they got into office and received the support of staff in the Civil Service. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, did not do that. He dealt with the grievances, problems and salary structures of Deputies. I compliment him on that because credit must be given where credit is due.My party did not have a good general election and, as a result, a high price was paid. We lost some of our colleagues and our secretaries both inside and outside the House. We often forget about the secretaries and the loyal service they gave to the Deputies every day for seven days a week. Once a Deputy loses his or her seat, some of the secretaries lose their jobs because they are on contract. I want the Department to respond to this issue. I call on the Minister for Finance, who has come into the Chamber, to ensure that the loyal service given by secretaries to Deputies is taken into consideration when applying for jobs in the health boards or county councils. They have the qualifications for such jobs because they know how the system works and they have dealt with problems which have arisen. I ask the Department to recognise the service and time they have given to the House if clerical positions arise in Mayo County Council, Cavan County Council or Donegal County Council. I ask the Minister to comment on that in his reply to the debate.Many secretaries feel let down by the system. They were busy during the election as they worked hard for the Deputies. Some of them have families, mortgages and commitments. Something should be done to help them. Packages are provided for Deputies who lose their seats and for secretaries, but some of them have more to give to the system. They have a great understanding of the system. I hope something can be done for them because they have been forgotten.I agree with what Deputy Howlin said earlier. We had wonderful people in this House in recent years who gave great service to the committees and who spoke on many Bills. They did a lot of work with limited resources. Many of them neglected their own work and subsequently paid a heavy price for it. I am glad Deputy Ó Caoláin is in the Chamber. It amazes me that I have to compete with Sinn Féin in my constituency. It has an  office which is staffed on a full-time basis. However, I have one secretary who is overworked and is not paid properly for the job she does. I would not be in Dáil Éireann if it was not for the support of my wife and family. I see other people at meetings who have the best research facilities and people to do everything for them. However, I must depend on my brain. I try to help my secretary, who has too much work to do, but I do not have enough time in the day to deal with it all.The media are always critical of politicians and they will not leave us alone. However, they would not be able to survive without us. They will not have enough stories during the summer recess, so they will make them up and hope the parties respond. They give out about the House but they would not have a job if it was not for the House and the county councils. They would not have anything to write about to fill their newspapers every Sunday. Newspapers sold best when nasty things were happening in the House. They do not seem to cover the positive things which happen here. One could make a great speech about something, but it would not appear in the newspapers the following day. However, if I made a serious allegation about the Minister this evening, I guarantee it would be on the front page of the newspapers tomorrow. Perhaps the media should look at the hard work being done by Deputies, many of whom were not rewarded at the last election.There are not any votes in the House, only in the constituencies. One must be in the constituency all the time. I told a political meeting one night that I would be a wonderful Deputy if I did not have to attend Dáil Éireann. I could visit every place in the constituency, but the problem is I must be here from Monday to Thursday. If I want to do my job properly, this is where I must be.I hope the Minister and the commission have discussions with the Members of the House about the budget and that we do not leave ourselves short of finance. We do not want the media to zone in on the fact that we have resources from the Department of Finance, but we do not have enough money in the budget. That is important. Members and former Members, who have gone through the system and who either lost their seats or retired at the last election, have a part to play in that regard. They should be brought on board because they have seen the changes in recent years.Every household now has a computer. We get more e-mails than letters every morning. We have telephones and mobile telephones. I have had one secretary since I came into the House eight years ago. We get an allowance for someone to help us out, but it would not pay for one day's work. The people want us to operate in a modern Parliament and to give a modern service. Almost one third of Members lost their seats in the general election because the people have high expec tations. They expect us to be able to give a complete service.I will give the House a simple example. I spent a half day on Monday on the telephone to the Passport Office because a constituent had problems with a passport which was sent by Swift Post. I compliment the Passport Office which did everything in its power to help. The person concerned was supposed to leave the country tomorrow. He spent €2,000 on tickets because he had got a job in America. He would have lost the job and the money only for the work done by the Passport Office and by me. People will say I should not have done that. If I told that constituent on Monday morning that I could not speak to him because I was a legislator who should be in the House of Parliament dealing with Bills, I would spend a short time here. I would be elected for only one term. I listen to the media and the critics who say we should not do council work or listen to people's problems. However, if we do not do that, we will not be Members of the House for long.We must get the necessary resources for this legislation. As regards the funding which will be put in place, I do not want it to be given to political parties. I will oppose it if it is given to my party, to Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party or Sinn Féin. The resources must be given to the individual Members. Deputy McGrath referred to a recent report which indicated that an additional 20 researchers would be provided. Even if an additional 40 researchers were provided in the library, more work would be found for them and the Members would continue to suffer from a lack of resources. It is time the Members' requirements were considered.With regard to the Freedom of Information Act, while I have nothing to hide, I believe we in this House have sold ourselves short in relation to expenses and our own private business. Within the next few months, the many new Members of the House will have to sign up and declare what property and businesses they have. The media will be only too ready to publish that information to let the public know what each Member has. Why should it matter what I own? As a Member of this House, I declare what I own and that information rests with the Clerk of the Dáil. If I speak or act on an issue in which I have a business interest, that should be dealt with promptly by the House, but why should what a Deputy has be any concern of Joe Soap? How does that serve the public interest? Why should that have to be put on display?If I was in power, I would deal with the freedom of information issue in relation to our expenses. I have no problem with people knowing our salary. My objection is to the media exaggeration of our expenses. Do people in the media not realise that, because I live in the west, 165 miles from this House, my expenses are obviously and necessarily greater than those of a Deputy who may live 20 miles from the House? Do they  not know that I have to pay for overnight accommodation while I am in Dublin from Tuesday to Friday – or do they expect me to stay on the streets? Why should my allowance for the use of a telephone be an issue? Are we expected to do without modern methods of communication? There is gross exaggeration of what Deputies are portrayed as "extracting from the system". I do not object to publication of what I get for travel and subsistence costs – that is what I personally draw. However, it is wrong to add in the costs of maintaining my office, which I do not personally draw. That issue should be dealt with without delay. We should look at the practice which applies in the British Parliament, where the expenses of MPs are not trotted out on the public media. It is time we took a stand on this. I emphasise again that I have no problem with publication of my salary and personal expenses but the day to day running of the office should not be for public consumption, resulting in the ridiculous accusation that Deputies are getting £100,000 – or the euro equivalent – out of the system.If we want a modern Parliament whose Members have up to date services and facilities, we cannot be expected to accept third class, inadequate resources and staff to assist us. In preparation for this debate, I had to read the Bill and prepare my own notes. My secretary is fully occupied dealing with day to day constituency work. Later this evening, I have to follow up on three pages of phone messages. I cannot just tell my constituents that I am a legislator – I have to listen to their problems and deal with them. We need the resources and staff to enable us to do our job properly. A recent report showed that we are the most under-staffed Parliament in Europe. That must change as we cannot continue under present conditions and expect to compete with the rest of the world. Ten years ago we did not have the pressure of having to respond immediately to e-mail messages and local radio stations. While we had a week or two to respond to letters, modern communications demand an instant response to queries from constituents which have to be followed up with Departments and other agencies. For example, at my constituency clinic last Monday, the wide range of queries included some from refugees seeking information on their rights. I also have to deal with inquiries from companies in relation to work permits and so on. I cannot be expected to have all the required information at my fingertips – I have to research it, put it together and convey it to the people concerned.Each Deputy has one secretary, who is allowed 21 days holidays each year and four privilege days, to which they are perfectly entitled. However, that means I have to do without a secretary for 25 days of the year. That would not be tolerated in any business or in any Department. There is no question of closing down the office or business because a secretary is on holidays – a replacement has to be provided. It is equally impossible for politicians to close down their  offices for 25 days of the year. There was a time when one could count on a relatively quiet period during the summer months, when there were less inquiries and problems being raised. That no longer applies and we are subject to calls every day of the year, regardless of the season. It is time we had adequate back-up, including additional secretarial service and some form of programme manager to assist us with the necessary research and information to do our job effectively. We cannot do that job under present conditions and that is one of the reasons there is such a turnover of people in this House. One has to make a choice, as new Members will soon realise, between being a legislator or doing constituency work. If one concentrates on constituency work, one has some chance of being re-elected but if one chooses to be a legislator, one has no such chance. Those who choose to be legislators will simply not be returned to the House at the next election.We must show some imagination and not be afraid to take the correct decisions. We are not looking for anything unreasonable. We are simply asking for adequate back-up and proper facilities. We are a modern Parliament and our Members need modern equipment and adequate staff. The Minister is not afraid to make political decisions. I compliment him on the political decisions he has made in the past and I hope he will do likewise in future. I hope an adequate budget will be put in place for a three year period. We should allocate sufficient resources now, rather than having to come back for more in two years time, with a further round of media criticism at that stage. We should have the courage to equip ourselves as a modern Parliament, without being afraid of what media people may say. We are not magicians, we are politicians. If we were magicians, we could deceive the people and avoid working for them. As parliamentarians, we have to do our job well. Civil servants and others do not have to go before the interview board which we politicians have to face every few years and which is becoming more difficult to satisfy, as Deputies on this side of the House have learned in the recent election. The normal practice has been for the electorate to take out the Government, but on this occasion they took out the Opposition instead. We may have had a bad day but there are better days ahead. There is a Mayo man at the helm of my party and I have no doubt he will be on the other side of the House after the next general election.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	317	In recent years there has been a gradual erosion of the position of Parliament vis-á-vis the Executive. There has also been a growing imbalance in the resources between the  Opposition and the Executive of the day. While Dáil reform appears to greatly agitate the members of the Opposition, when they get into Government it falls down the list of priorities on the political agenda.The erosion of the position of Parliament is bad for our parliamentary system of democracy. For example, among many of the findings of the DIRT inquiry was the generic one that what happened in terms of the extent of tax evasion was the consequence of the failure of parliamentary accountability. As of yesterday, €446 million has been recouped for the Exchequer as a result of the inquiry. What happened could not have occurred were it not for a breakdown in the kind of parliamentary accountability and scrutiny that should normally apply.However, this accountability and scrutiny cannot happen when all the resources available are allocated to the Government side of the House and when, on this side, even frontbenchers are expected to operate with the assistance of a very badly paid secretary. I am not sure if I can make sense of the requirement by the Department of Finance that those leaving the service must make their decision by Friday. Should they leave, they cannot change their minds and stay on for a year, thus enabling them to qualify for the few cent of severance pay to which they would be entitled. They must decide now or contract for the lifetime of the Parliament. Despite this, Members would be unable to recruit from outside the kind of people who can do the job that is expected of those predominantly female staff who work for us. As Members we have failed over the years to make that point to the Department.It is a serious injustice to attempt to equate those working for Members, not to mention frontbenchers, to the grade of clerical officer in the Civil Service. The Civil Service unions are partly to blame for this due to their dog in the manger attitude. They do not accept these workers into their union because they are not regarded as civil servants, which is strictly the case, yet, they are damned if they will get anything that does not have knock-on effects throughout the service. I cannot see the merit in this situation. It highlights that we have never asserted ourselves as Members of Parliament and that decisions are made by others. That is not in the interests of our parliamentary system of democracy, nor of the relevance of this Parliament in the minds of citizens, nor, ultimately, of the Civil Service.The germ of hope I see in this Bill is that it will allow for a devolution to the elected Members of this House of the governance of the institutions of Parliament, the Seanad and the Dáil. There are great possibilities here. This is not to denigrate the excellent service we get from the officials of the State who work for the Houses of the Oireachtas. The civil servants who have served this Parliament have generally been of a high quality. They have constantly been prepared to work above and beyond the call of duty, including  ridiculous hours, and under serious pressure at peak times in Parliament in terms of legislation, including when several Bills are due for consideration at the same time, as happens under the current plethora of Dáil committees.We, the elected Members, should decide whether we are seriously interested in Dáil reform. I ask the Minister and, through him, his officials to consider how often this Parliament has seriously engaged in such reform. The answer is hardly at all since the foundation of the State. If we are to seriously address the question we should do so in a radical way that brings this Parliament into the 21st century.I am not concerned with issues such as the press releases that the former Chief Whip and now Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, used to issue at the beginning of the Dáil or a new parliamentary year. I fully admired his skills in being able to declare great progress in Dáil reform, evidenced by the number of committees he established and changes he introduced. That only tinkered at the edges. The parliamentary committee system is as much dictated by the necessity to create Chairs for disappointed backbenchers in the Government parties than it is for legislative scrutiny. There are so many disappointed sore heads in the backbenchers on the other side of the House that there is a need to exceed in number the 21 committees which existed during the lifetime of the last Dáil. That is usually the dictating factor, not whether it is in the interest of our system of democracy.This House cannot service 21 committees and it is transparent that the staff cannot do so. The membership of the Dáil, at 166, compares with a membership of over 600 in the House of Commons. Given the size of the House of Commons and the fact that some of its membership does not aspire to office while others specialise in foreign affairs, public accounts or whatever, it would be possible to have such a committee system there. However, if one allows for the 15 Ministers and all the Ministers of State and their Opposition counterparts, it is clear that this House is too small to service such a system. While it is a mechanism to provide a chocolate sweet to those Members with a sore head because they did not join the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, in the ministerial ranks, it is not Dáil reform.If we are serious about Dáil reform and concerned with making an historic breakthrough we should do it in a fashion that brings this Parliament into the 21st century. This involves making major decisions. I am not sure how this can be done in the context of section 5 of the Bill, which appears to stipulate the budget that will be made available. I do not know how it is calculated nor whether, on the basis of multi-annual budgeting, it is a three year multiple of the anticipated outturn for 2002 at today's rate. I understand the Minister is to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage that will vary the figure provided for but that the figure agreed will be the fixed  amount unless he comes back to the House for legislative authority.We need to know what this figure takes account of, especially given the huge imbalance in the allocation of resources. One of the joys which the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, whom I am delighted to see in that office, has perhaps not yet savoured is that he will now have a constituency office of faithful civil servants looking after the drudgery in which he has been so proficient in Dublin North-Central up to now. He will have four or five people to staff the office. I do not know if Deputy Michael D. Higgins would be prepared to put down a question, as Deputy Callely used to do in the past, to find out how many civil servants are working in the offices of Ministers. If we had the staff, we could do a research project on the kind of questions Deputy Callely used to put down.

The day will come when one is no longer a Minister, when the rug is pulled from under one's feet and one is an Opposition Front Bench spokesperson with, as Deputy Ring said, only a secretary to back one up. That is an indication of the stark imbalance in resources that exists between this side of the House and the Government side.The Department of Finance has a role in terms of monitoring public expenditure, although one would not know that from the past 18 months, but generally that is its role. It is beyond me how it can be posited that that imbalance in resources is in the interests of our system of parliamentary democracy. Given the complexity of issues that regularly come before this House, one cannot expect any kind of informed contribution from the Opposition on a sustained basis without backup being available.I do not know what commitment is envisaged in terms of that backup. I will be told we made the decision ourselves. If there is a problem with something in the Civil Service the solution is to bring in consultants as a first step. Someone brought in consultants here – maybe we did – but I would rather see half a dozen Members being asked to do the job. We know more about it than consultants. Nevertheless, we have the report on the international benchmarking review on Members' services prepared by Deloitte & Touche. I do not know what status these recommendations have. Does this document go to the commission? Is it taken as an interesting submission or is it a template for the way forward?One recommendation is for a dedicated research service of 20 researchers associated with the Library. That is a good idea as our Library  has traditionally been badly resourced. However, it does not resolve the problem that as a member of the Labour Party I do not want to go along to a central research unit to be told how I should look at the latest piece of intellectual property before the House. I would like to be able to consult my own researcher who reflects Labour Party thinking in preparing my contribution on an issue. A central unit will not solve the problem.Another recommendation contained in the report is that each Deputy be provided with one additional member of staff. What status does that have, if any? Colleagues have spoken to me about constituency managers. Front Bench colleagues in a number of parties have spoken of their preferences for a researcher. I do not know why we have to make this choice if we are serious about parliamentary reform. If I had to make this decision I would choose to have a competent, qualified researcher, but I do not think we ought to have to make that choice. The report assumes an average cost for a researcher of €39,000 per annum, including salary, employer's PRSI, pension contributions and so on. One is not going to get a researcher worth tuppence for that salary as the net income is less than €30,000. That is insufficient to attract a competent person with some degree of experience. I do not know if this is what is being proposed, and I presume the Minister in his reply will say if he is to introduce an amendment that will fix a figure based on something that is acceptable to the Members of the House in terms of additional staff.I am greatly amused to hear the Taoiseach and Tánaiste regularly say we are going to build a world class stadium. We do not know whether we are going to build it on the site of the old Irish Glass Bottle Company in Deputy McDowell's constituency or in Abbotstown, but it is going to be world class. We are at the cutting edge of information technology. We have brought in electronic voting because we have to send out the message to the world that this is the intelligent island. I do not know what was wrong with the system of voting we had, but we have to have electronic voting because we have to convey how modern we are. If we are going to do all those things why can we not apply it to the Houses of the Oireachtas? If we are to have a world class stadium, why can we not have a world class Parliament?

I did not hear a solid commitment on that from the Minister. I do not know if the Deloitte & Touche report has been accepted. Is it a matter for the commission? The Ceann Comhairle, it appears, will lead the proposed commission that will make decisions about the governance of Parliament. Let me make it clear that I do not want anything I am saying to be taken as reflecting on the current eminent office holder, Deputy O'Hanlon.The imbalance in this House is on the Opposition side. In recent years we have abandoned the convention of this House that the Ceann Comhairle is taken from the Opposition side, which is a great pity. I do not know how it came about that yet another chocolate sweet had to be given out to the Government supporters allowing them to elect their own Ceann Comhairle. The tradition was that he was drawn from the other side of the House regardless of who was in Government. The role of the Ceann Comhairle is critical. The entire commission will fall if we end up doing what the Government or the official side want us to do, or if we employ more legal advisers to tell us what we cannot do. We want to know how we can do things, and therefore the balance on the commission will be critical. Obviously we have to tailor our cloth to fit the measure in terms of times of stringency or whatever, but this is the national Parliament and our citizens depend on the quality of legislation enacted to a considerable extent, which is sufficient reason for us to resource it accordingly.I wish to refer to an exchange that took place between Deputy Conor Lenihan and Mr. Kieran Coughlan, the Clerk of the Dáil, at the Public Accounts Committee on 22 February 2001 as follows:Deputy C. Lenihan: Is it still the case that we are the worst resourced Parliament in Europe?Mr. Coughlan: That is right.Deputy C. Lenihan: I know you compared it to Belgium.Mr. Coughlan: Our resources were less than 50% of those in the EU in terms of resources per Member and in terms of staff.Deputy C. Lenihan: Less than 50%?Mr. Coughlan: Yes, 50% less than the EU Parliaments in terms of budget per Member and staff per Member.Deputy C. Lenihan: Where do we stand on a general European comparison as opposed to the Belgian comparison? Are we bottom of the league again?Mr. Coughlan: We are.Deputy C. Lenihan: Of all the EU?Mr. Coughlan: Yes.That is our comparative position. If we are not permitted to take that as the base line and to engage in serious Dáil reform on this landmark occasion, we will never do it. We are running out of time. This House is becoming less and less relevant in the eyes of very many citizens and if we are going to make it relevant again, this will be an essential component.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins.I welcome the opportunity this Bill affords us to discuss the running of the Houses of the  Oireachtas. It is timely because it is being introduced at the start of a new, and what is clearly a very different, Dáil. The Dáil is now more representative than ever before of the political diversity in this State. The smaller parties have come back in greater strength and among the Independents there is a broader political spectrum than before.I must put on record at the outset my disappointment that the Government has to date refused to agree the necessary changes to Standing Order 114 of this Dáil in order to give proper recognition to my party, Sinn Féin, and to the other smaller parties and Independent Deputies. This is directly relevant to the legislation before us because proper recognition for political parties is essential to the general running of these Houses as well as the running of Dáil business. Cross-party co-operation is vital and for this to happen the integrity of all mandates, including party mandates, must be given due recognition.This arises directly under section 8 of the Bill which sets out the composition of the Houses of the Oireachtas commission. It is proposed that four members will be from the Dáil and three from the Seanad. The problem rears its head immediately as to how smaller parties and Independents can achieve proper representation.For decades this Dáil was totally dominated by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The way of doing business here has been moulded by that by-gone reality and the three-way split is still the dominant approach. My party is denied access to our own Priority Questions, leaders' questions and Private Members' Business. We cannot fully participate in the Business of this House in all its aspects. We live, quite literally, on borrowed time, just as in the case of this debate. Once again, I urge the Minister and the Government to end the democratic deficit in this House and put the matter right before the Dáil adjourns for the summer recess.These difficulties can be resolved easily if there is goodwill and common sense on all sides. It suits none of us for the business of the Dáil to be delayed or disrupted. I must emphasise that we are not looking for special privileges. Proper recognition of all mandates will ensure the smooth running of Oireachtas business, but I want to reiterate – I have no doubt but that I have the support of my colleagues in the Green Party and the Independents – that if the rights of all Members and all parties are not vindicated, then we will continue to oppose the daily ordering of Business on the basis of Standing Orders which do not reflect the reality of how the people voted in the general election. I hope and believe we can resolve this issue and avoid that scenario.I fully acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in facilities in these Houses in recent years, but they are still far from satisfactory. Ministers and Deputies supporting the Government have the use of legions of civil  servants to cater to their every need. Opposition Deputies must cope with inadequate staffing levels and other minimal resources, especially in terms of research. This places us all at a huge disadvantage.One of the major problems in these Houses is the lack of proper press facilities – I hope our friends in the press will take note. We have no rooms for press conferences or press interviews. Buswells Hotel is effectively the press centre of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Interviews must be conducted on the plinth and cleared beforehand with the Superintendent or the Captain, which is often a major inconvenience for Deputies and for the media, given the need for rapid responses to issues as they arise. The Superintendent and the Captain should not be burdened with this type of work and the new commission must address as a priority the whole area of media facilities.Even after the addition of Leinster House 2000 there is still inadequate use of space in the Houses of the Oireachtas. My party requires, as a matter of urgency, more office space in addition to that currently allocated. At present, two of our Deputies are sharing an office designed for one person and two are in single rooms with little space for their secretaries. We have no designated party meeting room. While I realise the limitations, I urge a thorough review of the use of office space in this complex. This should be one of the first undertakings of the new commission.It has been mooted in the past – I want to pay particular attention to this issue and ask that it be noted – that the Oireachtas would seek to remove its neighbour, the National Museum, from its fine building here in Kildare Street in order to take over that space. I would be strongly opposed to such a move. The National Museum, an Leabharlann Náisiúnta, the newly extended National Gallery and the Natural History Museum are all vital parts of a fine cultural complex at the heart of our capital city. They attract tens of thousands of visitors every year and should not only remain but be further enhanced and developed.Many of the established working methods in Leinster House, both in terms of the actual business of the Dáil and Seanad and the management of the Oireachtas as a working environment, have come down to us from a bygone age. They were inherited from our former colonial governors at Westminster, where parliament is run in the manner of a gentlemen's club. We are not quite that bad, but much remains to be done to make this a more efficient and accessible Parliament. To take just one example, it is incredible that in 2002 we still do not have a crèche available for the many hundreds of people who work in this complex. This is disgraceful in an institution which should be an example to all other employers.I entered this House five years ago as the sole representative of my party. It was a strange and solitary experience. There were some friendly faces to greet me but I have to say that many more were not so friendly. Sadly it was not my  fellow Deputies who were of most assistance to myself and my parliamentary assistant at that time, but the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Ushers, administrative staff in the various offices, library staff, the IT unit and restaurant and bar workers treated me and my assistant with courtesy and friendliness and have always done so. I want to place on record my appreciation for the work that the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas do in all the many and diverse aspects of life here in this complex.Deputies and Senators account for only a fraction of the number of people who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas. For that reason I strongly contend that the make-up of the commission as proposed is totally insufficient. There are to be seven Oireachtas Members on the commission, but where is the representation for the hundreds of staff members of all grades? It might be argued that the Secretary General will represent them but this is totally unsatisfactory. There should be worker representation. In a democratic institution such as this, there ought to be the fullest representation and participation possible. The workers' representatives could be directly elected or nominated by the relevant trades unions or by a joint trades union committee of the trades unions representing workers in these Houses. However it is done, it should happen and I want to signal my intention to table amendments in that regard. I urge the Government and the other Opposition parties to accept the principle of full and proper representation for all who work here.

I strongly support the original motion as proposed by Fine Gael, except that there is no point in launching more marketing campaigns in the US and the UK per se. There needs to be a targeted approach. In his amendment the Minister “notes the challenges facing the tourism industry in 2002 arising from the aftermath of the tragic events of the 11 September last in the US.”  Those events have impacted on the tourism industry in particular. The Green Party joins the Minister in noting that.Does the Government have any plans to tap into the enormous goodwill towards Ireland of over 40 million Americans of Irish descent, not to  mention other Americans? Are there any plans to use this goodwill in terms of encouraging people to come to Ireland as a home away from home?I welcome the foundation of Tourism Ireland which started up during a particularly difficult period. Under the circumstances, it has performed fairly well. In that respect, I support the amendment. However, I disagree with the Government's amendment on two points, particularly in respect of the Agreed Programme for Government, which is strong on aspirations but very short on substance. This is especially noticeable in the area of tourism. For example, some of the actions proposed in the Agreed Programme for Government include fostering expansion and competition on air and sea routes, but there is no recommendation or allusion to how this will be done. Given the input of the Progressive Democrats in this Government, it is all too likely that Aer Lingus may come under the hammer for sale. Certainly, if one is trying to increase the role of Shannon Airport in terms of having more people travel to the west of Ireland, getting rid of Aer Lingus will not help one whit.Why bother creating a new national tourism development authority which will complement the work of Tourism Ireland? Why not just make Tourism Ireland the authority with the remit to look at developing tourism and give it more powers beyond marketing? In terms of the maintenance of standards and services at the top of the tourism agenda, what steps can the Minister take in light of the Forfás report to market Ireland as a high quality but competitively priced tourist destination? Are there any plans in this regard?With regard to encouraging year-round, activity-based and special interest tourism, what sort of tourism are we talking about? Does the Government have any clarity or focus in respect of these issues? What is meant and how will it be done?

They cannot afford housing, but there are mini-ghost towns that contribute nothing to the economy. There must be a better way, which I hope the Minister will outline in his response.Insensitive development over the next ten or 15 years will continue to destroy Ireland's unique selling point, its greenness and heritage. We will not have an island to market. What steps will be taken to ensure that the fragile ecosystem, which attracts so many Americans and Germans in particular, will be maintained?

This will come as little surprise to anybody living in the 26 counties in recent years. The prices of one's weekly shopping, ticket to the cinema, few pints and lunch have all risen in recent years. While there are a number of reasons for this, it is inescapable that, since the changeover to the euro, there has been profiteering and excessive greed. Who can blame those who have increased the prices? They are only doing what the Government encouraged them to do – screw the punter and take what you can. Eircom shareholders will know all about this.While this may seem irrelevant to the motion before the House, it points to a factor that should not be overlooked when trying to understand why tourist numbers are falling and, consequently, why revenue from tourism is down.One must ask if Ireland is an inviting place to visit, are we targeting the right tourists, are we investing in the right infrastructure to facilitate tourism and are we pricing ourselves out of the market? While I have no doubt that we need to promote tourism in the USA and the UK, we must not limit ourselves to these markets but reach for new markets and offer new opportunities to those involved in the tourist industry.Kerry, especially south and west Kerry, is largely dependent on German and US tourists for the generation of income and for its overall development. Since 11 September, the number of tourists visiting the area has greatly reduced. Jobs have already been lost and some businesses have gone to the wall.We need to urgently review our attitude to tourism nationally. We need to invest and fund the development of infrastructure to cater for tourists. With regard to Kerry, I can testify that the infrastructure in place is not always able to cope with the demands made of it. When that happens, it can have a very negative impact and leave a lasting impression on our tourists. I refer in particular to the road infrastructure in west and south Kerry.While the US and UK markets are obviously valuable they are not the only countries in the world from which we receive visitors. As members of the euro zone we need to increase our efforts to attract other European visitors. The benefits are obvious for them and us.There are also other markets to look at. After the Italia '90 World Cup, we were told there was an influx of tourists from Italy to Ireland. Apparently, this was attributed to the great behaviour and humour of our soccer supporters while in Italy. We are told that there is plenty of evidence to suggest that our supporters in Japan and South  Korea were equally well received while they were there for the World Cup. The Government and our tourism agencies must strike while the iron is hot and seek out new markets in Asia.Returning to my original point on the cost of living in Ireland and the negative impact it has on the visiting tourists, there is also an knock-on effect that needs to be addressed – the issue of insurance and the massive price increases that have taken place in that industry. Insurance affects many aspects of the tourism industry. From the person organising hill walking tours to the owner of a family tourist farm to hotel owners, insurance costs have become prohibitive. This is all part of the general rip-off to which everybody, not just tourists, is subjected on a daily basis.While we may not be able to force people to come to our country, we can make it easier for them by improving our infrastructure, reducing the cost of living and making insurance affordable. These issues can be tackled if there is a political will. Ireland is a beautiful country and Kerry is a beautiful county with a lot to offer.

The industry has long been one of the mainstays of the Irish economy and has withstood many setbacks such as the foot and mouth outbreak and the aftermath of the 11 September tragedy in the USA. Nevertheless, there is considerable room for exploitation and expansion of this potential jewel in the economic crown of Ireland.There are a few areas where such expansion could be applied. Not enough is being spent on internal marketing of the country's attractions. Beauty spots such as Killarney and Connemara are continually highlighted in tourist information literature but little or no mention is made of the attractions of areas such as Kavanagh country in Monaghan, the Shannon Pot in Cavan, Slieve Beagh and Lough Muckno. In the past, Cavan and Monaghan achieved an international reputation for fishing facilities on local rivers and lakes and many British and European fishing championships were held there. This contributed handsomely to the local economy. We could get back to those days with a little more aggressive marketing on the part of Bord Fáilte. In contrast  with major festivals such as the Rose of Tralee—

Knowing your reputation over the past five years as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I have no doubt about your ability for and interest in your job. I wish you well.I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in his new post, which is possibly the most relaxing part of the Cabinet with arts, sport and tourism all combined. Justice was finally done in giving Deputy O'Donoghue this portfolio. I say that as a colleague of the former Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I am glad to have the opportunity of reminding Deputy O'Donoghue so early in his term of office that all the work is not complete in Donegal and therefore we will be extending an invitation to him to visit the area. We all know that it is not so cold up there.In Donegal we have lost an industry – in the form of textiles – and I see tourism as a possible big employer which could affect job creation in the area in a positive way over the next number of years. The impact is already being felt in agri-tourism, marine tourism and many other areas. We want to see real jobs. Some people in our neck of the woods feel that a tourism job is not a real job – they are not familiar with Kerry and other famous tourism destinations and see tourism as some sort of second best. I do not see tourism jobs as second best. Jobs in tourism have improved because of initiatives taken by the Government, such as the introduction of the national minimum wage. People are no longer being exploited to the same extent in the jobs traditionally associated with tourism. I am not speaking only of those working in the hotel industry as I see a vast potential for job creation within the entire tourism network.When I spoke on tourism previously in this House I complained about our geographical location and the isolation we felt in Donegal, north of the North. Without people coming into an area there are few incentives to investment in either accommodation or facilities. Even with its natural resources, Donegal is in a chicken and egg situation. There can be no investment without people coming into the area but people will not come into the area unless there is some reason to come. We believed there was a reason to come but unfortunately there was no money coming in for people to develop their facilities. Happily, things are beginning to change and are actually  changing rapidly. This has been due to the tremendous achievement of the Good Friday Agreement. We have 140 miles of border with the Atlantic and 70 miles of border with the Six Counties, but less than 7 km of border with the rest of the Republic. Therefore, the tourism of north-east Donegal was very much reliant on people whose families came from the area and who were returning home from abroad.There has been much talk of the millions of pounds going into marketing. A significant portion of those millions is sitting on shelves or in boxes in the backs of offices as brochures and leaflets. In my own home town a number of bus operators, from Scotland and other places, such as PAB tours from Dublin, bring busloads of people to the area, not only during the high season of two weeks in August – not the three months of summer, but two weeks – but all year round. If those companies got a bit of help with their marketing they could double their current business. These are real people coming in and spending real money. I ask the Minister to consider giving an incentive to the tour operators with a proven track record of bringing people into an area. If he was to give them a small bit of marketing money he would see a return.In the past, people were actively discouraged by our own national tourism agencies from coming north. I say that without fear of contradiction because my own father once went to a tourist office in Cork looking for information on Donegal and was told not to go up there as it was too dangerous. I am glad to say that since the Good Friday Agreement things have been getting better. The Agreement has led to more open co-operation at every level. We, in the North West Region Cross Border Group, had worked with Derry City Council, Limavady Borough Council and Strabane District Council for almost 30 years, but there was more talking and planning than doing. There was no structure for funding and no real political will at a higher level to promote such activity. It therefore pleases me to take a flight from Derry to Dublin and see people – locals or strangers – heading off or going home with their luggage. I am delighted with the ease of access created by the flight and delighted that the Government has delivered on the public service obligation and ensured that our access was improved.On a practical level, I was very emotional on Friday, 7 June when the first car ferry sailing took place from Greencastle to Magilligan. This linking of Donegal with the counties of Derry and Antrim has been a long-imagined dream come true for many, including my father, who was in the cross-Border group for 16 years prior to my arrival almost seven years ago. It was with great pride that the members of Donegal and Limavady councils past and present took their places on the ferry for that first sailing. I was almost overwhelmed at the significance of this event which had taken almost 25 years to be realised, but very  proud at having played a part in setting up the funding for it. I thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for that.Donegal was years ahead of the projections of the experts because we saw real opportunities for tourism locally. We exploited our own markets instead of reaching out to America, although I do not underestimate its importance. It has now been pointed out by the experts that Northern Ireland is an important market because of the relative values of sterling and the euro and all the advantages associated with that. We were ahead of the all-Ireland tourism body concept – we went out, put it together and delivered. We talk so much about peace and reconciliation, but what could be more appropriate than a physical link? People from the other side of the Foyle have already come over on the ferry and had their first experience of Donegal because of this piece of infrastructure. The ferry is already increasing the numbers of day-trippers and will ultimately be useful on the larger tourism access front as the marketing kicks in.This is not the only Government support we have received in this aspect of our tourism drive. We have a ferry ready to start crossing the Swilly which will link Buncrana to Rathmullan. After the success of the Foyle ferry, which has only been operational for a couple of weeks, I await with excitement the impact the second ferry will have on the peninsula. We were speaking last night of the details of cross-Border revenue and heard that sea traffic is down. Ferries have massive potential and we intend to continue to explore links between Donegal and Scotland.I ask the Minister to continue putting pressure on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to expedite the delivery of the programme for marinas, which has been earmarked for funding under the NDP. Projects are at an advanced stage for both the Foyle and the Swilly and the potential for bringing yachters into the region is huge. We look forward to its becoming reality. Yachting and water-based sporting activities are hugely underdeveloped and I hope the Minister will consider this aspect of tourism which overlaps somewhat with the area of the marine. Water-based activities are not our only offering to tourists. Our golf courses are already famous enough to make Nick Faldo want to purchase the Glashedy links in Ballyliffin although he was unsuccessful. The courses are attracting a huge number of clients and these numbers can only increase with the decision to market them jointly with the courses in Port Stewart and Royal Portrush as well as those in the rest of Donegal.Malin Head, the most northerly point in the country, has been neglected down the years, although it should have had massive tourist potential for geographical reasons. However, even this is starting to change. I thank the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, for the moneys he provided to ensure that Malin Head Development Association was able to employ a development officer  to assist it in implementing the recommendations of its development plan.There is so much potential to be realised in locations such as Malin Head that I trust the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, can work alongside the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, in his portfolio of rural development to make more of the dreams become reality. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, would examine with his Northern equivalent the issue of rail links from Dublin to Derry and Donegal. Access plays an important part.The Ring of Kerry may be fixed on the tourist map but it is nothing compared with the jewel we have held hidden for all these years in Inishowen. Having insulted the Minister, I trust he will take an interest in the difficulties our tourism representatives bring to his attention during his term in office. I know that, with his supporting roles in arts and sports, he has at his disposal a huge resource to make a difference in any region to which he turns his attention. Perhaps he would turn his attention to us.
#MichaelCollins	unknown-#MichaelCollins-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I wish to be associated with the good wishes expressed by Deputy Keaveney to the Ceann Comhairle and to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. I extend those to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and wish them all every success.I was glad to hear the Minister state the other evening that he took the initiative of meeting with the chief executives of the key tourism State agencies to get an up to date briefing on the most critical issues facing the sector and the current state of the tourism season. No one can deny that, after the terrorist attacks of 11 September last, many challenges face the tourism industry. Some 70% of all passengers on transatlantic flights every year are flown by Aer Lingus to and from the United States. The immediate consequences of the attacks in America was a falling off in passenger numbers travelling to Ireland on tourism breaks. We know the importance of American tourists travelling to Ireland.As a Member of the House for the constituency of Limerick West, I am acutely aware of the important role tourism plays in the development of the mid-western region. Shannon Airport is a central cog for tourism development in the region. Some two million passengers travel through Shannon Airport every year and we must build on these figures at every opportunity. We do not want under any circumstances to lose the right to retain transatlantic travel to the mid-western region. That is because we know from our statistics that a large proportion of the people who travel to Ireland book their holidays so that they can disembark at Shannon Airport. I hope this remains the position for some time to come because it will help to ensure that the tourism industry in the mid-west remains competitive.This is an ongoing political issue of concern to people living in the mid-western region and the Government must remain highly vigilant when this issue comes up for discussion within the  European Union in future. The Government supports the principle of balanced regional development. Supporting the tourism industry and the ongoing development of Shannon Airport contributes to improving the economic climate in this important region.The Government is due to publish a national spatial strategy which is premised on the need to develop smaller towns and villages. Such a spatial strategy must include an element that supports the tourism industry where it plays an important role in the development of the local community. The spatial strategy, by its definition, is premised on outlining a framework for the future development of our country. Tourism plays a central role in the development of our country and should be part of the final strategy when it is published.I welcome the recent decision by Ryanair to increase flight numbers at Shannon Airport. The introduction of low cost travel certainly helps to boost passenger numbers from Shannon Airport to and from Britain and other European destinations. I hope Ryanair will increase the number of flights that will be made available from Shannon Airport in future. I believe in competition in the airline business. Good competition has a direct consequence on the cost of flights for passengers. That is a plain and simple fact and one hardly anyone could deny. I support continued assistance for regional airline routes in Ireland. Flights to and from Dublin to other destinations, such as Kerry, must continue into the future.The Government recognises that substantial funding must be available to market Ireland as a tourism destination. That is why I welcome the successful start-up of Tourism Ireland and the fact that €50 million is being made available for the international marketing of Ireland as a tourism destination. I acknowledge that that amount is being made available to Bord Fáilte this year, of which €25 million is being used for market-related activity. Under the national development plan, the objectives over the next five years include the increase in tourism revenue and helping tourism achieve a wider seasonal and regional distribution of business. These key objectives can best be achieved by marketing Ireland on an all-island basis and by the international marketing of special interest products, but we can only achieve them by increasing the level of radio, television and print advertising in new and evolving markets.The United States is still the fastest growing market for us at this time, but other countries such as the Netherlands, Italy and those in Scandinavia are performing well in terms of the numbers of tourists coming to Ireland. We must ensure that adequate resources are made available to market Ireland on the Internet and that we use every advertising tool at our disposal. This is an expensive business but one which clearly bears fruit in terms of securing increased tourist numbers.I wish to make a few points about niche marketing. Special interest products such as golf,  cruising, conference facilities, angling, marine tourism and walking are especially important in developing a sustainable tourism industry because such niche markets deliver higher yield visitors, are more inclined to benefit from wider geographical areas and are more environmentally friendly. Support will be provided for the branding and marketing of special interest products, with priority being given to those which incorporate an industry partnership approach to development. In addition, smaller and less developed niche businesses must and will develop. Small operators, including bed and breakfast and other small accommodation providers which are essential to the tourism industry, must be given support to market their products at home and abroad.I welcome the support which is and will be given to the tourism industry in the Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. It is clear that we will broaden our tourism source markets so that we will not be overly-reliant on any one market. We want to increase our share of the continental market in particular. We will foster expansion and competition on air and sea routes, continue to support the bed and breakfast and small accommodation sector through specific marketing initiatives and ensure local authorities take account of the needs of the tourism industry in the provision of infrastructure.It is not only an increase in the level of financial support for national roads that is needed to develop our tourism industry further. We must also continue to support financially the development of our secondary and county road network in rural parts of the country. I urge the new Minister for the Environment and Local Government to continue to allocate the necessary resources to develop all aspects of our road infrastructure. We will encourage year-round tourism activity and special interest tourism.One element of the joint programme I am pleased to see is the support for the Tourism Ireland initiative. This new body was set up in December 2000 under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement to market Ireland, North and South, as an international destination. The Government will support and promote Tourism Ireland in its work of promoting the whole island of Ireland as a tourism destination.We will complete the task of creating a new tourism development authority which will complement the work of Tourism Ireland. The National Tourism Development Authority brings together the functions of Bord Fáilte and CERT. The establishment of this authority is especially appropriate at a time when the industry is at a pivotal point in its development. This authority can help shape the most sophisticated tourism products which are available in a changing international marketplace. The National Tourism Development Authority can build on the proven knowledge, skills and experience of Bord Fáilte and CERT and combine these to create new syn ergies which will provide highly effective institutional arrangements to support the development of tourism.Tourism is in a healthy state despite the setbacks presented by the events of 11 September and the foot and mouth scare in 2001. Tourism and travel statistics for last year show that earnings from overseas visitors increased by 5%. It appears the domestic market for tourism is substantially improving and our tourism agencies are correct in encouraging Irish people to take holidays at home in an effort to support such an important national industry.It is clear the Government intends to support the tourism industry and I was pleased to hear the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism say so last evening. It is putting in place a wide range of measures which will help further the development and quality of tourism products.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department and wish him well in what will be a difficult area. Indeed the figures the Minister gave us last night in relation to the tourism industry are indicative of the task ahead of him. Last year, for the first time after ten years of growth, we saw a fall in tourism numbers but, given the problems the international market has faced, figures are holding up relatively.It is apt to have this debate as it comes at a time when the Government is facing belt-tightening. I commend the Minister on what he has done in his short time in office and for what he outlined to us last night as his vision for tourism in Ireland. We should acknowledge the many successes of Irish tourism. We have seen ten years of uninterrupted growth with overseas visitor numbers reaching almost six million in 2001 and foreign tourism revenue earnings reaching almost €4 billion. This is not an insignificant feat and all those involved in the tourism industry throughout the country are to be commended on it.International comparisons show us to be one of the strongest growing European tourist destinations but we should acknowledge that we came from a very low base and that ten years ago the tourism industry was in a poor state when compared with our Continental colleagues because they had been in the market before us. We may have been late starters but we have done particularly well in recent years.Last year our tourism industry suffered severely on two fronts. First, we had the unfortunate foot and mouth outbreak in early spring which severely restricted foreign tourists coming into the country, particularly from the UK, and had a devastating effect on some sectors of the tourism industry. Second, was the attack on the twin towers in New York on 11 September which effectively shut down tourism world-wide for a short time. We are only now beginning to recover from that. Central Statistics Office figures suggest that in 2001, overseas visitor numbers were down by about 5% in comparison to the 2000 figure of six  million visitors. Even with this decline, the volume in revenue receipts increased by 16% according to Bord Fáilte figures issued this year. The knock-on effect of this is that employment is down slightly. CERT maintains that the recruitment of skilled personnel for the industry remains a problem as evidenced by the number of foreign nationals employed in this sector.Air and sea passenger movements this year have seen an increase over last year, however it has been suggested that a major proportion of this is accounted for by outward movements which can be put down to the poor weather we have experienced this summer. The US continues to be a difficult market with some improvement becoming evident in the Continental market. The news this evening that Aer Lingus is preparing to axe some of its Shannon-based schedules to the US for its winter season does not encourage confidence. The US market, where a big effort has been made, remains strong according to Bord Fáilte. The domestic market remains good which many competitors put down to the competitive pricing by hotels and I have noticed aggressive marketing campaigns by hotel chains which is to be welcomed.The shortfall in tourists, particularly from the US, means that some sectors of the industry, most notably the coach tour business, have been badly affected. The knock-on effects will be felt most severely in areas such as Cork, Kerry and Connemara which are more dependent on this type of tourism than other areas. Tourism Ireland Limited has a budget of €50 million which is supplemented by regional budgets through Bord Fáilte. I understand from the Minister's statement that extra funding will not be made available. This is understandable given the pressure on public finances however, it is important that Tourism Ireland Limited and Bord Fáilte maximise the budgets they have left for the remainder of the season.I will turn my attention to some of the counties which would not have traditionally been seen as attractions, including my own county of Carlow. Over the past five or ten years, small counties have done much to attract tourism. Carlow has invested heavily in its efforts and resources over the past five to ten years in promoting a novel gateway for foreign visitors and there are many other counties which could benefit from a little imagination and the assistance of the national state agencies.Small towns and villages throughout the country have much to offer. For example, Leighlinbridge is a small village in County Carlow which won a gold medal last year in the Entente Florale competition. Many would say it is a tourist's dream. Just off the beaten track and the Dublin to Waterford road, it enjoys many facilities including its beautiful location on the banks of the River Barrow with boating, angling, river cruising and river side walks as well as first class accommodation, food and drink all within an hour of the port of Rosslare and an hour and a  half from Dublin airport. Other towns in the county such as Rathvilly, Borris and Tullow boast international standard golf courses and facilities. Regrettably, our national agencies are not promoting these sufficiently. Bord Fáilte estimates that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland will have declined by some 7% in 2001 and are not expecting a great improvement this year, however I compliment the Minister and the Government on trying, in what is a difficult season, to encourage as many Irish people as possible to holiday at home. I also commend them in their marketing efforts overseas on the Continent, in the UK and the US to encourage people who have not had the opportunity to visit Ireland to come for the first time.I ask the Minister to continue his good work, implore the State agencies not to forget the small, off the beaten track counties like Carlow and wish the Minister well with his new portfolio.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I wish the Minister well in his new job and congratulate him and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on their appointments. I wish to share time with Deputies McCormack, McGinley, Perry, Crawford and Enright.I congratulate and commend Deputy Deenihan on bringing forward this motion. There is no better person to do so, given that like the Minister he comes from County Kerry which is probably the jewel in the crown of the tourism industry. People from that county have intimate and detailed knowledge of the industry and it is interesting to see the Minister and the Deputy debating this issue. I commend Deputy Deenihan's motion to the Minister and urge him to invest money in this area in order to attract visitors to Ireland and counteract the negative aspects that have developed in tourism during the past 18 months.Tourism is extremely important to our economy. When I was young, agriculture was the mainstay of the economy. However, tourism has now become another mainstay and employs 145,000 people, 60,000 of them in hotels and bed and breakfast establishments, and brings in €6 billion to the State coffers each year. We must recognise its importance to our economy. At a time of crisis, we must also recognise that action needs to be taken in order to counteract the downturn in the industry. It would be a good investment to market our country as a tourism resort. Last year, for every euro spent there was a return of €50. Surely we must seek to exploit this and I urge the Minister to respond to Deputy Deenihan's motion in a positive fashion.The Minister must be concerned that there has been a downturn of 25% in the number of visitors from the United States, that the number of visitors from the UK is also down – a strong marketing campaign must be engaged in to reverse this position – and that the European market is static. We must promote Ireland and its image  as a tourist and holiday destination, particularly because we have a valuable and unique product to offer.We must be extremely concerned that the Shannon survey has given a very gloomy forecast for 2002. Feedback from the June survey, which was undertaken on 135 tourism businesses by MRBI on behalf of Shannon Development, has confirmed that there was a downturn in holidays in the Shannon region, in which my constituency is located, during the period January to May. The survey also highlights the difficulties the trade will face over the full year.I represent an area which is dependent on tourism and I live just three miles from Adare, which is known as the prettiest village in Ireland. We have felt the immediate effects of the difficulties experienced by tourism providers in our community. Shannon Development has confirmed that over half of the tourism businesses across the sectors in the Shannon region have indicated that trade was down in 2001. It has been an extremely difficult year for tourism interests in the west because of the foot and mouth crisis and the impact of 11 September. According to the Shannon Development regional tourism manager, less than one fifth of companies and operators are indicating growth.While tourism in 2002 is generally down, the performance of the overseas market is of greatest concern with 55% of Shannon region tourism businesses experiencing a downturn and less than one in five experiencing growth. These are grounds for extreme concern and I urge the Minister to invest in attracting visitors from abroad and to take action to counteract what is happening in the tourism industry. Trade feedback also indicates that the North American market – this was anticipated to some degree – is proving the most difficult, with two thirds of those surveyed who deal in this market experiencing a downturn in their business. The German market is also giving cause for concern.Even coach tour operators, who have been quite active members of the industry for many years, are experiencing a downturn in trade. Visitor attractions and the entertainment sector have been particularly badly affected and 80% of visitor attractions have indicated that a segment of their business is significantly down.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	341	The year 2000 was very good for tourism interests in Ireland, but it is unfortunate that since then it has been all downhill. In early 2001 we had to introduce foot and mouth restrictions which was followed later by the tragedy of 11 September. These events greatly affected tourism interests and the result was that 2001 was the most difficult year ever for Irish tourism, with great losses being experienced by many businesses. Hotels, guesthouses, B&Bs and  the economy in general all suffered. Business from North America has been greatly reduced and seat capacities on airlines flying directly to Ireland have been reduced by 21% nationally, while seat capacities on direct flights to Shannon have been reduced by 30%. The latter will have a serious impact on tourism in the west. There has also been a significant reduction in the number of American coach tourists visiting our shores.The reduction in the number of tourists to Ireland will have a serious affect on hotels and guesthouses. However, the impact has far wider implications for the entire tourism industry. Approximately 60,000 people are directly employed in hotels and guesthouses but there are also coach tour operators, coach owners, those who service and repair coaches, car hire operators, the owners of golf courses, those who offer angling holidays and those involved in other tourism interests whose business is being affected and reduced. In addition, the various spin-offs from tourism have also been affected. There will be serious job losses unless corrective action, such as those outlined in the Fine Gael motion, are put in place.Consideration must be given to the increased costs the tourism industry must face. Insurance costs for hotels, guesthouses and related tourism activity have escalated and increased by 48% in one year, despite the fact that business volumes decreased. Tourism is one of the few industries which is regionally based and investment in it should also be regionally based. In the west, angling tourism has been hit and the number of angling tourists visiting the Corrib region is down. The numbers of people taking sea cruises are down by 18% and sea angling figures and also down.I ask the Minister to indicate his views on the success of the marketing efforts of Tourism Ireland, which was introduced for the first time from January this year. I understand that the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation has sought further promotional aid. Will the Minister indicate the nature of the confederation's request for such aid? I suggest that now is the time to take this initiative, which needs not be very costly. I am aware that advertising expenditure in America is costly, but not if it is properly targeted at the potential Irish-American market. The Minister would be well advised to obtain Exchequer funding for that purpose because it would be money well spent.It was depressing to read in the Evening Herald last week that one of the most renowned bed and breakfast guesthouses in the Connemara Gaeltacht, which has 14 bedrooms, played host to only four visitors in one weekend. This is a serious matter and the Government needs to put in place a focused marketing strategy to improve the situation. The point has been raised about the difference in air fares, depending on the way one  travels between America and Ireland. We need to instigate a much more aggressive marketing campaign aimed at Irish Americans in particular. The article in the Evening Herald to which I refer pointed out that Americans are not alone in believing that foot and mouth disease still exists in Ireland and some of them even believe they could contract it if they come here. That may sound hard to believe, but it is true.We need to do a great deal of work to establish a clear market. We all remember the heroic efforts people made during the foot and mouth crisis when they voluntarily stopped travelling and called off many sporting and other events. At the time we heard fine words from the Minister and the Government to the effect that they would be rewarded. Perhaps now is the time to do so. It would cost just a fraction of what the crisis cost. The owners of some tourism businesses, particularly those running and developing small bed and breakfasts, remortgaged their houses. They are now in serious trouble and need assistance. I welcome the Minister's appointment and ask him to concentrate in his new capacity on these people. The Government has not done enough to help the tourism industry since the foot and mouth crisis.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him the very best in what is a very important job. Tourism is one of our biggest industries and has the potential to surpass all others. While the opportunities are immense, the industry is facing huge problems. Many villages and towns across the western region are dependent on this significant sector of the economy. We cannot assume that past performances offer a way forward. In the north-west we must ensure that those involved in the tourism industry compete at the upper end of the market. It is essential to provide a quality brand. The real problem is that business has not started, the year to date has been disastrous and the season will be very short. It is now late June and the growth envisaged from the US, UK and European markets has not materialised.I wish Deputy Gallagher well on his appointment. It is good to see a man from the north-west in office as he will examine the issue of the region's growth, which is very much needed. We need new attractions because many of the tourists who have been visiting for years go to the same destinations. They want a change and if we are to develop tourism in the region, it is very important to offer them new attractions. It is not good enough to direct tourists to the same attractions a second time.The previous Government allocated funding to the BMW region for a very ambitious plan for clustered developments. While I welcome this possibility, I hope it will be accelerated and ask  the Minister to give a clear indication of the projects under consideration.We must encourage enterprise. The growth in the economy, particularly the tourism sector, is due mainly to people who have taken risks. We do not want the tourism industry to be taken over by massive consortia. People who take risks in small business and provide services in the tourism sector are entitled to some support. Unfortunately, they are offered very little comfort and no support. They have to make considerable investments and as the sector is very staff intensive, staff costs are high. The biggest difficulty, however, is VAT. By just putting food on a cooker, its cost increases by 21%. Every €1,000 in income a businessperson gets has a net value of only €790. One must also subtract from this figure the cost of the product. The consumer in the restaurant or hotel does not realise the difference between gross and net income. Revenue from tourism is huge and it is time to reconsider this tax.Sligo is Ireland's best kept secret and, while Donegal is very well promoted, there is major potential for growth in the region through cross-Border development and co-operation with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. I have pointed out that the greatest difficulty in the past 30 years was the lack of cross-Border growth. The work of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy McDaid, on this issue needs to be accelerated. Guesthouses and hotels need to be offered major encouragement. The British Government has extensively funded businesses in the six counties of Northern Ireland. Very little support has been allocated by the Programme for National Recovery fund, INTERREG or the International Fund for Ireland despite the huge potential to do so. While there are fantastic people working in those bodies, it is regrettable that more funding has not been allocated to grow cross-Border tourism. We have 32 county tourism potential.I was very disappointed by the contract awarded by the State for commuter flights between Galway, Kerry, Derry, Sligo and Knock. A new airline, Eureka, which operates from Waterford, was brought in. This raises questions, particularly with regard to the fantastic service being built up by Aer Arann, which allowed people to fly to Copenhagen and offered an international link. I appeal to the Minister to check out this matter as Sligo was seriously disadvantaged by the Minister for Transport last week when he awarded the contract to an airline which does not offer the possibility of international travel. The decision has far reaching implications for the growth of tourism in Sligo and the Border counties.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The tourism industry is a very important sector which needs to be nurtured. Historically, agriculture was the number one industry  in the State. With its decline, there is a great need to build up and retain as strong a tourism industry as possible in order to maintain rural Ireland. Although foot and mouth disease and the events of 11 September have undoubtedly hit tourist numbers during the past 12 months, we cannot ignore the issue of increasing costs which have been discussed in the House in the past few days. As they will damage our competitiveness against other countries, they will need to be managed properly at Government level.I pay tribute to the tourism industry in County Monaghan under the chairmanship of Mr. P.J. Russell. Historically, County Monaghan has attracted one of the lowest number of tourists in the country. We have some great hotels catering for passing traffic along the N2, but only some 20 registered guesthouses and a number of family run hotels.Great efforts are being made to build up business in Canada and the USA, for example, P. J. Russell has been there for several weeks in a personal capacity trying to promote the county. I welcome the fact that people can now fly into Dublin directly from Toronto. However, with numbers from the US and Canada down by up to 50%, we must use every opportunity to advertise and promote for the future. This is what the motion is about.The Rally School based near Scotstown, County Monaghan, which won the AIB rural tourism award last year, is a good example of how local people with some support can create a niche market. This business was estimated by the AIB experts to be worth £2.5 million to the area and the school uses much of the accommodation in County Monaghan and the Border region. We need more support in areas such as north Monaghan where tourism had a poor record in the past. We need support for bed and breakfast establishments and for family run hotels in town such as Clones and Ballybay.The wedding of Sir Paul McCartney and Miss Heather Mills at Castle Leslie in Glaslough, County Monaghan was of major benefit to the tourism potential of the area and of the whole of Ireland. I spoke to someone in Canada who had watched the event on television and had a very positive response to the coverage. We must make sure that such benefits continue. Ms Samantha Leslie and all those working with her in Glaslough deserve credit and need support in building up a business in an area which was hard hit by the closure of roads and the Border activities of the past.Cross-Border involvement is essential if we are to build up a tourism culture in the Border region. It was Deputy Enda Kenny, as Minister, who initiated co-operation between North and South to promote tourism on an all-Ireland basis.  Problems later arose regarding the Shannon but Deputy Kenny promoted a very positive attitude and we must build on that. A fast link exists through Northern Ireland between Larne and Stranraer and between Belfast City Airport and Britain. This should be used, as well as Dublin, to bring tourists to the northern part of the country. In the past the tourism industry was geared to bringing people to places such as Donegal, Kerry and the west in general.Without proper roads, railways and airports we cannot promote tourism. I am frightened by the information coming from Government regarding the danger that roads such as the N2 from Dublin to Derry and Donegal – Derry is the third largest city in the country – may be left out of the national plan for road development. Without proper road structures people will not be encouraged into an area.Since the railway was done away with in the 1950s successive Governments have promised support for the main road arteries but this has not happened. I trust the Ministers for Finance, Transport and Arts, Sport and Tourism will make sure these roads are created.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Everyone accepts the importance of the tourism sector. In the midlands, my own part of the country, the sector has been growing in the last number of years. We must be conscious of our need to promote Ireland internationally but also to ensure that we give a fair and even spread to the promotion of tourism.I welcome the work of the regionally extendible fund but I am concerned that it is only available to organisations with international elements in their programme and is primarily geared to new projects. New projects can receive 75% funding, reduced over a number of years but the fund ignores an important reality in the tourism sector. In my own area Ely O'Carroll Tourism has benefited from the fund. However, many organisations cannot become commercially viable in the short number of years in which funding is available. Unless funding is provided to small organisations which promote their regions on an ongoing basis it will be impossible for these organisations to exist. Some such organisations have benefited from the social economy programme and are trying to venture into the commercial sector but that was not their original aim or intention. These organisations must spend their time and energy organising fundraising events in order to survive and cannot focus on their original objective of promoting tourism in their own areas.Little help is available for the promotion of domestic tourism interests. We must encourage Irish people to holiday in Ireland. Funding tends to be concentrated on new ventures so that projects find it difficult to fund themselves on an ongoing basis. This problem must be addressed.Many people have taken risks with their own money in recent years but this willingness to take a risk in the tourism business is declining, which is understandable. A new heritage hotel with 118 beds opened recently in Port Laoise and is a tremendous local amenity. However, there is a reluctance to set up smaller amenities. After last year's experience of foot and mouth and the events of 11 September people are nervous to take risks. There is also considerable uncertainty regarding the continued threat to air travel from industrial action.We have a high quality tourism product in Ireland. We are still "Ireland of the welcomes" and people still want to come here but we have not marketed ourselves as effectively as we might have done. A tourism operator from County Laois who visited the Bord Fáilte office in New York after St. Patrick's Day last year found that the office had no promotional or information literature on County Laois. Eventually a book on the county was found but it was eight years old. If information on all counties is not available we cannot promote the entire range of our tourism product.We must address the high insurance costs. This is becoming a debilitating factor for those who are trying to set up in the tourism sector. People are working very hard to provide a good product but this is becoming increasingly difficult. Promotion is the key. Our favourable exchange rate should entice large numbers to Ireland from the United Kingdom but unless we promote all our counties we will not persuade visitors to come. This is our greatest failing.

Mar Theachta Dála as Dún na nGall, tuigim cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an tionscal seo don tír go léir, ach go háirithe do na réigiúin. Tá a fhios againn go maith go bhfuil an tionscal seo ag fás níos tapúla ná tionscal ar bith eile sa tír nó ar fud an domhain. Dá bhrí sin, ós rud é go bhfuil an tionscal ag cur an oiread sin jabanna ar fáil is ceart agus is cóir go mbeimís ag díriú ár n-áird air.I welcome this opportunity to respond to the debate on this motion and to the contributions made by the various speakers.For decades, tourism, like the services sector in Ireland, was very much the poor relation of manufacturing. Its potential to generate employment, foreign revenue and wealth was poorly recognised in a practical way. That attitude began to change with the launch of two integrated, EU co-funded, investment programmes for the tourism sector during the latter part of the 1980s and into the 1990s. This, in turn, prompted private investment in facilities and services for tourists of  a multiple of that figure, including non-grant aided investment in the accommodation area – in hotels, in hostels and self-catering. These major investment programmes coincided with the advent of low cost access, an increase in the "fashionability" factor for Ireland plus a series of targeted marketing programmes implemented by Bord Fáilte in co-operation with the industry. All of these factors, placed in the context of the general economic boom that Ireland has experienced over the past decade, combined to make the success story that was Irish tourism by 2001.There was a strong sense from a number of contributions during this debate that the tourism industry countrywide is facing a major downturn for this year – or a "washout" as described by one Deputy. I think Deputy Durkan struck a more balanced tone when he cautioned against talking ourselves into a recession and stressed the need to maintain competitiveness within the industry. As the Minister pointed out yesterday, official CSO figures are not yet available for tourism performance in 2002, and it is very difficult at this stage to predict the outcome of this year's season. Of course many people are concerned due to the many factors mentioned.Recent qualitative industry surveys by Bord Fáilte, CERT and ITIC show a mixed picture. For example, ITIC's recent survey showed a number of niche markets such as incentive travel, meetings and conferences, events and sporting holidays proving to be strong this year. Tourism Ireland Limited believes the first part of the year was reasonably good. There has been a good response from the British market. The German market is soft – that is the case for its outward travel generally – but France and the southern continental destinations have produced a response ahead of target. There are also indications that the very strong performance in the domestic market towards the latter part of last year has continued into 2002 and this has been beneficial to many businesses, especially hotels. We all accept that this is a difficult and challenging year for Irish tourism. Such variations in the business cycle apply in the case of many other industries. However the medium to long-term prospects for tourism are undoubtedly bright.Many speakers commented on the softness of the US market. I agree this continues to be a challenge, not alone for Ireland but for tourism the world over. In her contribution to the debate, Deputy Lynch seemed to criticise the fact that the Government and the Minister insist on applying a value for money approach to the deployment of additional resources to the marketing of tourism. I remind the Deputy and this House that this year has seen the largest ever budget of €27 million being deployed for the international marketing of the island of Ireland and that we will spend close to €110 million overall in Exchequer funding this year in support of the tourism industry. I can  assure the Deputy and all Members that decisions on the deployment of the marketing element of this contribution, which were taken in close consultation with the tourism industry itself through the tourism marketing partnership structure, were very clearly informed by a value for money approach.Coming as I do from a Border county and having listened to other deputies from Border counties, I recognise the great return on marketing investment in our home and the Northern Ireland market.I commend the Government amendment to the House.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I wish to share my time with Deputy Deenihan, with five minutes for me and ten minutes for him.I listened to the Minister speak about the amount of money the Government has spent this year in promoting tourism in the country. However he neglected to tell us that most of that money was spent this year setting up Tourism Ireland to promote tourism on both sides of the Border. I come from a major tourism destination in the west and I have been told Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland have no visibility in America since last April because they ran out of money. It is time we lived in the real world.At the end of every year we are told by Bord Fáilte about the record number of people that come to the country. It does not tell us it counts every cow and sheep and everybody who enters or leaves the country. Everybody who comes into the country for a funeral or a wedding is regarded as a tourist by Bord Fáilte. For the past three years there has been slippage in the numbers of people coming into the country. Anybody living in the real world, particularly the people who have invested in the hotel sector and other aspects of tourism say we have had three bad years because we are not out there aggressively fighting to try to get the market. We have let the American market slip. We should be out there battling now. The people of America are only now getting over 11 September. Some of them have not even made plans for their holidays this year. They are now flying John Travolta around the world to try to get people to come to America. What are we doing about it? We are doing nothing. It is time we got out there and promoted our product.I want the Minister to bring this message to Bord Fáilte. It is time the tourism sector in this country lived in the real world. I am tired of people saying there is a goodwill factor from America and Britain towards Ireland. They want good value as well as goodwill, but they are not getting good value. There is a report in today's newspapers saying we are the second dearest country in Europe. It is time we got value for  money. It is time the tourism sector and Bord Fáilte woke up and did their job. All they are good for is wining and dining. They are good at selling themselves, but not selling the product or doing the job for which they are paid. The taxpayers are providing the funding, but we are not getting value for money.We are not getting the people who should be coming here. We are not over in Britain selling our product. The British people are flying all over the world but are not coming into this country. We did well for a few years with people coming to Dublin and other cities for weekends. However, we want the tourist that used to come from Britain. That was the tourist that saved for ten months and came here with his family to spend his money. We cannot do that if we do not have people out there marketing our country.The tourism sector here must start trying to give value for money and cannot take it for granted that we will fill the country for ten or 12 weeks of the year. That is not going to happen. We must have the product, including food and bed and breakfast accommodation, at a reasonable price. However, that is not happening because the Government has done nothing about controlling insurance costs. We should be ensuring these people give value for money. As a result of the fact that they are not giving value for money, people are going to Spain and elsewhere. Bord Fáilte needs to be shaken up because too many of its members are there too long and have gone stale, a bit like the product we have.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Fine Gael put down this Private Members' motion in response to the calls from the tourism industry for help. These pleas for help are coming from all parts of the country and from all sectors of the industry. As I outlined yesterday evening in introducing this motion, there is an impending crisis in the industry.The Minister lives in the heart of Ireland's tourism industry. As he drives through Killarney, Killorglin, Glenbeigh and Waterville, he can witness for himself the decline in the number of tour buses coming to Kerry and the fact that many tour buses are half empty. All he has to do is call a number of tourism operators in his constituency and he will be told bluntly that business is down considerably, staff will have to be let go and that the prospects for the rest of the season are bleak. He was told this by members of the Kerry branch of the Irish Hotels Federation in Killarney on Monday. I understand that the Minister will receive a similar overview of the current state of  tourism at the meeting with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation tomorrow. Those people will confirm what I said here yesterday evening.The Bord Fáilte tourism barometer survey, which was published last week and covered 1,000 tourism enterprises nationally, confirms that 2002 is proving to be a very difficult year and that a recovery cannot be taken for granted. This survey shows that bed and breakfast and guesthouse accommodation, which was badly hit in 2001, is showing no sign of any significant recovery this year. The numbers indicating a deterioration in business compared to last year are more than double those reporting an improvement in conditions. Around 40% of hoteliers reported a less favourable position than 12 months ago while 66% of coach operators reported business down on a year ago, despite the problems of foot and mouth disease then. A large Kerry hotel, that is well known to the Minister, had 72 coaches visit in March 2001 and just three coaches this March. This is a clear indication of the magnitude of the problem facing the industry. Golf courses, which have a heavy reliance on the US market, are also taking a hit. Tourism visitor attractions are reporting a significant drop in visitors, due almost entirely to the decline in the US market.Feedback from the June 2002 "Shannon Pulse" tourism survey, undertaken among 135 tourism businesses by MRBI on behalf of Shannon Development and published yesterday, confirms a dramatic downturn in holiday and leisure business in the Shannon region during the January to May period and also highlights gloomy trade forecasts for the full year. There is a marked decline in demand for Ireland from the US market, with the coach tour sector servicing this market experiencing a decline of 40%. The number of US tourists coming here could be down from 1.1 million in 2000 to almost 850,000 this year, which is a return to 1996 levels.While I agree with the Minister's objectives of broadening our markets and further developing our continental markets, we must never forget that the greatest yield per visitor comes from the American tourist who spends almost €900 per person –€83 per day – in the country. This compares with €63 per day for the British visitor and €53 per day for Europeans. Over 40 million US citizens claim Irish ethnic links and it would be a major retrograde step for tourism if we diluted in any way our marketing efforts in this lucrative market. This was insinuated last night by the Minister when he suggested that we would look at other markets. It has been mentioned that the projected increase in British arrivals will make up for the shortfall from the US. However, it should be noted that in 2000 the average length of stay in Ireland by British visitors was approximately 5.6 days compared to 9.6 days for US visitors. It takes almost two British visitors to equal  one US visitor in terms of time and money spent in the country. It has been insinuated that we will get more visitors from Britain to make up for the shortfall from other locations. They will not make up the shortfall from America unless they come in large numbers.The achievement of tourism in 2001, which the Minister mentioned yesterday, was amazing when account is taken of the traumatic events of that year. However, 2001 would have been a disaster except for the additional €8 million provided to Bord Fáilte for a reassurance marketing campaign in the US and Britain and the extra €1.3 million provided to promote domestic tourism. This confirms what I said last night: if extra money is provided the people will travel here. Industry sources estimate that this additional overseas effort resulted in an extra €130 million of overseas tourism revenue and the home market initiative boosted domestic activity by more than €100 million. The Exchequer benefited by at least €120 million from this additional activity. This action maintained at least 20,000 jobs which would otherwise have been threatened. A similar effort is now necessary for this year.Despite the statement that record funding is being made available for marketing this year, industry sources are saying that there is less advertising activity by Tourism Ireland in our two main overseas markets, namely, the US and Britain, than there was in 2001. I would like the Minister to clarify that as soon as possible. A large amount of the money that was committed for marketing has, I understand, gone into start-up costs for Tourism Ireland which is establishing new offices etc. The industry is convinced that less money is available this year than was available last year.Our spend in those markets is even more important when our competitors are spending substantial additional sums in promotion. Britain is in the middle of a high profile £40 million advertising campaign which includes Tony Blair appearing on US television. It is also spending a considerable amount of money here; we see that in our newspapers and on television every day. I see more advertisements for holidays in Britain than for this country and it is very effective advertising. Britain is also spending considerable amounts of money elsewhere. Canada is spending $20 million on promotion on the American east coast and our major competitors in the British market are also substantially increasing their spend, France being a case in point. All this activity is continuing as we speak and Ireland is missing an opportunity and doing virtually nothing. These competitors do not share the view that it is too late to advertise for the peak July to September season. This is of greater importance with the phenomenon of very late booking so evident this year. We are missing out on this opportunity.We should be reminded of the saying, "You cannot put last night's empty hotel room or the empty seat on an airliner which left ten minutes ago, in a freezer and sell them at half price at the end of the season". Tourism is an industry where action must be taken now. Otherwise we will lose the potential which is still there for this peak season. Immediate funds should be made available to allow Tourism Ireland to continue its highly effective television and radio advertising campaign in the US featuring Martin Sheen of "The West Wing". This campaign was very effective following the foot and mouth outbreak last year and in the early part of this year. A similar campaign should be carried out in the UK.The future of the Irish tourism industry is now in the Minister's hands. Another disastrous season will wipe out many of our tourism operators across the country. The whole future of our tourism industry will be irreparably damaged and, like  farming, the strong will survive and the small operator will go out of business. Our tourism product will suffer if that happens.In his contribution the Minister said he intends consulting widely with the industry and the tourism State agencies to guide him further in his work and that he would urgently review the situation to see what further steps can be taken to help the industry to meet the unique challenges which it is facing this year. The Minister should already know what they will tell him. There is no need to consult them, he should just provide the funding for which they have asked.Last night the Minister introduced a Supplementary Estimate of €30 million for sport which I welcomed. If the Minister is serious about helping this struggling industry, he should support the motion and introduce a similar Estimate for tourism before the Dáil rises tomorrow.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I raise this item on the Adjournment to draw attention to the fact that Comer International is experiencing difficulty in relation to the current market. The company employs 180 people plus a number of part-time staff and seasonal operators. It has been in the Castlecomer area for the past 33 years and is the main player in the world-wide yarn market. In fact, the world headquarters of its operation is based in Castlecomer. Its customer base covers over 67 countries. Its effectiveness, in terms of the marketplace, can be underlined by the fact that it is there for 33 years and is a main player. The difficulty it is experiencing is due to costs and its product is mounting up because of the company's inability to deal with the price on the current markets.I want to draw attention to its cost base. I raised some of the issues here almost 12 months ago. This industry has given good employment in north Kilkenny for 33 years. It is one of the only companies to have lasted for such a length of time. Most of that area in north Kilkenny where it is located is recognised as disadvantaged under the RAPID programme. If this factory was to run into difficulty it would cause further economic problems for the area.There is an in-built bias in investment towards the IT sector and while I support the development of information technologies, perhaps it is time to look at the development of a bias towards the textile industry which is currently under threat. I ask that the PRSI rates for this sector be reassessed and that the energy costs sustained by companies' such as Comer International be addressed also. Last year this company paid £1.5 million in energy costs, an increase of £250,000 over the previous year. That is a serious disadvantage to the company as it adds to the cost of the product going to the market and makes it uncompetitive.I have no doubt that if the various State agencies give the appropriate support to the company at this stage it will pull through its present difficulties. It is extremely important in terms of the employment it gives to north Kilkenny. It behoves us to give as much attention as possible in terms of State support to the company. I understand that a meeting is to take place shortly between company management and some of the representatives of the State agencies and I hope that out of it will come some type of structure that will deliver benefits to the company in terms of its markets and will examine the cost structure in regard to the issues to which I have drawn attention, particularly PRSI and energy costs. Because of the presence of a skilled workforce and good management through good times and bad, if we structure some kind of support for the company it will pull through and grow and prosper. Take-overs have been occurring in that sector and if we are to the fore in supporting that industry in north Kilkenny we will ensure it continues into the future. It has built on fairly secure jobs and we can maintain those, but it does require assistance with its current difficulties.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The chief executive officer  of Enterprise Ireland, Mr. Dan Flinter, is meeting with the managing director of the company tomorrow, Thursday 27 June 2002. The purpose of this meeting is to examine and discuss the current difficulties being experienced by the company. Enterprise Ireland will, of course, provide whatever assistance it can. The position, as I understand it, is that the company has gone from a full seven day working week to a five day week. Both management and staff have agreed to this new arrangement as an initial step to secure the future of the plant.The current situation has been brought about by a number of different dynamics coming into play. Eight years ago there was a surplus of wool and the price of wool was suppressed. This has now changed and wool prices have risen by 25%. Wool spinners have not been able to pass this on to clothing manufacturers. Retail sales have been poor worldwide which has also reduced the demand for cloth.The company is winning the available business but sales are only at two thirds of 2001 levels. This, coupled with high stock levels and a slow down in drawing down stock by customers, has forced them to place staff on short time. The situation will be reviewed in July but it is not expected to be fully clarified until a clearer view of business order books for 2003 can be established later this year.The company has had to respond to the existing market conditions so that it can maintain a strong position in the international marketplace in the future. It has ambitious plans to grow the business over the next three years and has planned some substantial investments to support it.The company, as the Deputy stated, has been operating in Castlecomer for over 30 years and is both a significant and important contributor to the local economy. It is, of course, one of the major employers in Castlecomer.This latest situation in Castlecomer serves to re-emphasise the fact that the clothing and textiles sector continues to face considerable challenges. Competitiveness is the key. We must be able to compete in the global economy. There are a number of competitiveness issues but, in clothing and textiles, the cost of labour is always high on the agenda. It is becoming harder and harder to compete with imports from countries where the cost of labour is significantly lower than in Ireland or the rest of the European Union.The industrial development agencies have the competitiveness agenda very high on their list of priorities. They are working with their client companies to make them as competitive as possible. Comer International is an important exporter as well as being a large regional employer. Significant investment has been made by Enterprise Ireland in the company over the years with the most recent being in April this year when sub stantial assistance was given to support training. The company, keen to maintain its competitiveness, has developed a comprehensive improvement plan aimed at improving work practices and up-skilling the workforce.As I have already indicated, I want to await the outcome of tomorrow's meeting between the company and Enterprise Ireland as the situation will only become clear after that meeting. I will be following up the matter with Enterprise Ireland and the full resources of the development agencies will be available to assist the company in whatever way they can.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	352	A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for selecting this matter on the Adjournment. The reason I asked to raise this is I have been trying since January of last year to get the list of the schools concerned in my county, and naturally I also tabled a parliamentary question on the issue to which I received a reply last week.During the week I wrote to you, a Cheann Comairle, and made a complaint about replies to two parliamentary questions tabled to the Department of Education and Science. I am a Member of this House and when I table a parliamentary question, I should get a reply. We are elected to this House and the staff of the Civil Service are in full-time positions. They are there to serve all Members of this House. They serve the Government but they are also required to give me the information I require for my constituents which I seek in parliamentary questions.It is not reasonable that I still must wait to get a reply to a question I tabled in January of last year, and I probably had that question tabled previously. If, tomorrow morning, a member of the media requested that information under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, it would be made freely available to him or her. As an elected representative to this House, I expect when I table a parliamentary question that I will get a reply from the Department. It is not too much to ask. I tabled this question on a number of occasions and it is wrong that the Department is allowed to act in this way.The text of the reply stated what the Department has been telling me for the past 12 months, that it has put a record amount of money into the schools building programme. That was not the question. I asked for a list of schools, both primary and secondary, in County Mayo which are awaiting approval for funding for renovations, refurbishment and any other works and I did not get a reply to that question.I do not want to come into this House to be awkward. A Cheann Comhairle, I wish you well. I believe that you, as a long established Member of this House, will protect our rights and I know that you will protect my rights. When I table a  question, all I want is the answer and I do not want to be told about all the Government money that is being spent. I want a specific answer to the question asked.In my county I am contacted by school managers, members of school boards of management, principals, teachers and priests asking about schools throughout the county. It is reasonable to request this information. That is why I raised this matter. I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, can give me that information and I hope that in future when I table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science, I will get the answer.This is not a very serious question or a big question. I know that the Department will say that these projects move on from day to day. So be it. I am entitled to get whatever information I seek on a particular day.I do not want to be disrespectful to the House and I do not want to be disrespectful to the officials, the Department or the Minister. I am depending on you, a Cheann Comhairle, and on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to ensure that I will get a response to my parliamentary questions in future. I hope that I will get a response to the question tonight. I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter. I am delighted you did. I know you will protect the rights of the Members of this House.

It is only in recent years that there has such been a sustained increase in the level of investment. As a result of the historic underfunding, the reality is that many schools are in need of substantial investment to upgrade to meet modern health and safety requirements. In particular, many second level schools built or extended in the 1970s and 1980s to cope with the expansion of student numbers were low-cost high maintenance buildings which have exceeded their natural lives and will have to be rebuilt over the coming years.It is not possible to wipe the cumulative deficit of generations immediately. However, the Government will continue to build on the substantial progress made by the previous Government in addressing the historical deficit in educational infrastructure. Redressing the situation will take time and the new Government is determined to ensure that the needs of schools right across the country are met. An Agreed Programme for Government sets out clearly the Government's intentions in this regard. The pro gramme states clearly this will be achieved through a multi-annual programme to be called the schools' modernisation fund which will be financed through the national development finance agency and through the maximum and appropriate use of public private partnership arrangements. The setting up of the national development finance agency will be addressed through the introduction of legislation. It is understood that the Department of Finance will bring heads of the Bill to the Government in a matter of weeks.A bundle of five second level schools are in construction in the first phase of a public private partnership arrangement involving second level schools. It is envisaged that this innovative method of redressing the historic under-investment in educational infrastructure will be used more extensively in the future.Earlier this year the planning and building unit of my Department initiated the EU tender process for a pilot project involving the organisation and undertaking of a comprehensive inventory of accommodation, including production of site and building survey drawings and general building condition reports, of approximately 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare and the compilation of the resulting information on a GIS database.This is a pilot project to aid the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs. The results of the pilot project will be used by my Department to determine the merits or otherwise of expanding the inventory on a nation-wide basis.Turning specifically to the Deputy's question, the 2002 building programme is published on my Department's website—

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	358	My colleague, Deputy Sargent, wishes to support me in the matter I wish to raise.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue here this evening. The problem relates to the Holy Family junior national school in Swords and the inability of the parents or guardians to secure a place in the school for their children, some nearing five years of age, for September next.The school's catchment area has traditionally been River Valley, an estate with in excess of 2,000 houses. Recently, the board of management widened the catchment to include new estates such as Ballintrane Woods, Highfield and Boroimhe, which is currently being developed. All are to the west of Swords.On 10 June, the parents were informed by the board of management that the school was losing a teacher, the 19th mainstream class teacher. Accordingly, given the number of places available, it was not possible to enrol their children for September 2002. The loss of the teacher was based on the enrolment figure in September 2001, which was a single pupil below the figure required to retain the teacher. Since then I have been contacted by distraught parents, with no realistic options available to them, looking for guidance and demanding the support of the Government because the other national schools in Swords, St. Cronan's and St. Colmcille's some miles away, are also full to capacity.It is difficult enough for parents who, through necessity, are required to work outside the home without having the Minister for Education and Science putting additional stress and strain on them and their children. This is totally unacceptable in any town or village, but especially in Swords, which is one of the fastest growing areas in the country and where there is always a demand for school places.Houses are being completed in this catchment area and families with school-going children are taking up residence on a weekly basis. I anticipate – I hope I am wrong – that the Minister, in the normal bureaucratic way, will state that the organisation of classes within the school is a matter for the board of management. I wish to confirm that the principal of the school has rejigged the classes to cater for the largest possible number of children. In addition, the school caters successfully for a range of special needs pupils such as children with physical and sensory disabilities, some in wheelchairs. Some of the pupils have special language needs as the school also caters for children of parents with refugee and asylum seeker status. Are all these pupils to suffer because of the Minister's intransigence?On behalf of the parents of all of the children attending this school, I wish to state that the Minister's response to date is totally unacceptable. The promises that were made in River Valley during the recent general election by the Fianna Fáil candidates, who are now Deputies, are unfortunately proving to be very  hollow. Regrettably, the children of the area will be the real losers.This issue can and must be resolved. As I outlined earlier, this is one of the major growth areas in the country and there are provisions and precedents for resolving this problem within the Department. Let the Minister prove his worth in respect of the provision of education for all our children, particularly in River Valley in Swords.

Holy Family school has a great name in terms of its educational standards, both at junior and senior levels. However, the Minister should take into account that the school is in an area which we are told is the fastest growing in Europe. At break time, one can see the children in very cramped conditions in the playground and, more seriously, in the crowded classrooms.Will the Government recognise that many people voted for Fianna Fáil in this area on the basis of promises that were made and an understanding that a Fianna Fáil Government would not let them down? I hope their trust has not been misplaced because, at this stage, they are desperate to see some response from the Government given that their children, as Deputy Seán Ryan said, cannot even get into the school and there are no alternatives. If the Government will not provide educational facilities for our children of whatever standard, preferably of a proper standard, it has no business being in office. That is a serious point that should be taken on board.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the accommodation of children in the Holy Family junior national school. The Deputy is no doubt aware that the school is losing a teacher for the 2002-2003 school year due to a decline in enrolments.The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.The enrolment of the above school on 30 September 2000 was 542 pupils, resulting in a 2001-2002 staffing of an administrative principal, 19 mainstream teachers, two learning support posts, one resource post and a temporary teacher for non-English-speaking pupils.The enrolment on 30 September 2001, on which the staffing for the 2002-2003 school year will be based, was 527 pupils. The staffing for the 2002-2003 school year will be an administrative principal, 18 mainstream teachers, two learning support posts, one resource post. The temporary  post for non-English-speaking pupils is currently being reviewed by the inspectorate.The number of pupils required to retain the 19th mainstream class teacher for the 2002-2003 school year is 528. If the board of management of the school feels that the enrolment for the school for September 2002 will increase substantially, it may apply for a post under the "developing school" criteria. The "developing school" criteria for the 2002-03 school year are outlined in circular letter 9/02, a copy of which was issued to the board of management of the school earlier this year. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular letter, the enrolment of Holy Family junior school on 30 September 2002 would have to increase by at least 30 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 2001. Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 557 pupils on 30 September 2002 to gain the post. If the board of management of the school is confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September 2002 will be in excess of 557 pupils it should apply to the primary payments branch of my Department for the allocation of a teaching post under the "developing school" status.The Deputy should also be aware that the organisation of classes in a school is a matter for the board of management. With regard to the issue of parents being advised that their children cannot be accommodated, the board of management should submit details to the primary payments section of my Department regarding the number of pupils it has enrolled for the school year 2002-2003 and also the names and details of the pupils that it cannot accommodate and to whom it has refused admission. The details will be examined as soon as they are received and my Department will be in touch with the board of management regarding the matter.

Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leatsa as cead a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ordú ar an Athló. I raise the matter of fish stocks taken from Irish waters by non-Irish trawlers to focus attention on the importance of this industry, which has been much neglected down the years, and also to put in perspective the wealth which has left Ireland at a time when the Government tells us to appreciate and be grateful for the funding we receive from other EU member states.The reality is that fish worth €2,500 million are taken from Irish waters by EU boats every year. Ireland's share is only €127 million. Ireland has 16% of EU waters and only 4% of the EU quota. In effect, this country is giving €2,400 million in what could be called structural aid to our EU partners every year. It is important to tell the  people these facts. The sea is Ireland's forgotten territory and our forgotten resource. We are told by our EU colleagues that we have done well out of our membership. This is true, but they have also done well out of our membership when the wealth taken from Irish waters every year since 1973 is taken into consideration.Over-fishing of Irish waters risks making this renewable resource extinct. I urge the Government to pay attention to the worrying signs of scarcity of fish resources in the Bay of Biscay and off Spain at present. French and Spanish trawlers may be prohibited from fishing in several offshore spawning grounds to allow fish recovery. This is wise, but the knock-on effect of such restrictions would be to encourage more non-Irish boats into Irish waters, including the Irish Sea, where many of my constituents earn their livelihoods. The closure of spawning grounds has been successful in the Irish Sea and a slow recovery in numbers of cod and hake has been noted. However, the cod box needs to be kept closed to ensure continuing recovery of fish stocks, which are very vulnerable to the larger trawlers now to be seen in the Irish Sea.It appears that no limit has been put on the size of trawlers. However, I recall that in the 1980s a maximum length of 90 ft was prescribed for trawlers in the Irish Sea. If the Government has any interest in the future of our fishing industry, such a limit needs to be enforced once again. Rules and limits are useless unless they are enforced. The rules on net size, logging of catches and by-catches and areas for fishing are not being properly observed. Fishery protection vessels and air support are also in need of greater investment. Otherwise, the Government will continue to spawn not more fishing but a culture of law-breaking and the death of the Irish fishing industry. The Government has got off to a bad start with the marine sector by dropping the title of Minister for the Marine. If it is to regain any respect it needs to apply itself to favour smaller trawlers and discourage monster boats such as the Atlantic Dawn, the EU registration of which defies logic and explanation. We need to enforce regulations to ensure fairness for all and provide facilities at harbours for proper waste separation and collection of oil, machinery and other materials.Most fishermen now see the benefit and the necessity of conservation measures. They have yet to see any practical commitment from the Government or any indication that it is aware of the wealth from Irish waters that goes to other EU members and that it is determined to conserve and manage this wealth in a way that ensures that it is renewable and available to this and future generations of Irish fishermen and women.The neglect by the Government of the marine environment is very obvious when one observes  our harbours, especially those in Dublin North. Not only are there few facilities in Balbriggan, Skerries, Loughshinny, Rush and Rogerstown, but wrecks lie abandoned, posing serious safety hazards for other boats navigating the harbours, especially in Balbriggan, and also for children who are attracted to wrecks lying off the harbour wall. The Government talks of rail and road safety. It is high time we saw action on harbour safety. Proper facilities in our harbours would indicate our awareness of our island status as a nation. Safety at sea is also a growing concern as trawlers are forced to travel longer hours and longer distances to catch the dwindling stocks which could formerly be caught closer to shore. The marine sector could be self-financing if it was managed in a sustainable and expert way. I urge the Government to reflect on the way the sector has been bankrolling Ireland's membership of the EU and to repay it with policies to ensure that it thrives.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I thank Deputy Sargent for raising this issue. The legal position within the European Community since the mid 1970s has been that all waters within the 200 mile coastal zone are regarded, for fisheries purposes, as Community waters. The common fisheries policy does not operate on the basis of national zones. At present, national 200 mile limits, including that of Ireland, are not used as a basis for the compilation of fisheries statistics or stock assessments. Ireland compiles sea fishery statistics for Irish fishing vessels and landings by foreign vessels into Irish ports based on the statistical zones defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES. Other EU member states also record similar statistics for their vessels with reference to ICES areas. These zones are designed to reflect the actual distribution of fisheries resources and do not correspond to national waters or zones of economic interest.Firm estimates of total catches and the value of these catches in Irish waters by other member states are not therefore currently available. The sea area defined by the Irish 200 mile limit is encompassed within ICES zones VI and VII but these zones extend to a geographical area far larger than the 200 mile limit. Details of the volume of landings of each of the member states in the relevant ICES zones are public information and are available monthly from the European Commission. However, information relating to the value of landings is not published by the EU and must be requested from each member state on an individual basis. Multi-annual statistics on the volume and value of total catches, by species, in the Irish 200 mile limit are not currently available.Around 40% of all catches in EU Atlantic waters come from ICES areas VI and VII and the proportion of these made in the Irish 200 mile limit can only be estimated. Notwithstanding the present statistical difficulties, the Department has made an estimate of the total volume and value of catches in the Irish 200 mile limit. It must be emphasised that this estimate is based on a number of assumptions made about the percentage of each fleet's catch in ICES areas VI and VII that can be attributed to the 200 mile limit. It is also based on of the number of vessels of all member states fishing in Ireland's 200 mile limit, the percentage of allocated quotas taken by each state while fishing in our 200 mile limit, the non-quota stocks taken from within the 200 mile limit, the catch per unit effort for the various fleets and the information obtained from inspections of log books and landing declarations of vessels fishing within the 200 mile limit.Based on available data sources at our disposal and within the significant limitations of the assumptions made and the factors to which I have referred, we can estimate that the Irish and other fleets catch approximately one million metric tonnes of fish annually within the Irish 200 mile limit. The first sale value of the estimated total catch within the 200 mile limit of all fleets, including the Irish fleet, could be estimated at some €1,000 million. I am arranging for our own landing statistics for 1986 to 2001 to be forwarded to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann for the information of Deputies. These statistics give the volume and value of landings by Irish fishing vessels into both domestic and foreign ports. In 2001 the total catches landed by Irish boats was 315,000 tonnes valued at more than €250 million.The Common Fisheries Policy, subject to quota entitlement, embodies the principle of free access to the fishing grounds of member states beyond the 12 mile limit. In so far as a share of the catch is concerned, these have been determined based on historical participation patterns and vary between ICES areas. Where member states have quota entitlements within the Irish 200 mile limit, as Ireland has entitlements within the 200 mile limits of other states, the fishing activity of their vessels is subject to quota limitations and to the maximum levels of actual fishing effort permitted in Western waters.In addition, under the Iberian Accessions Agreement, the total number of Spanish vessels permitted to fish at a given time in the waters around Ireland is 93 vessels, of which no more than 40 may fish in the Irish box. Overall access arrangements within European waters are a matter of Community competence, and Ireland cannot take unilateral action to reduce the number of vessels licensed by other member states to fish their quotas within the Irish 200 mile limit.Ireland, as a coastal state with a high level of fishing activity by other member states in the 200  mile limit, has outlined to the Commission and to other member states that an improved EU data gathering and management information system on all aspects of fisheries, including stocks, catches, landings and sales, is especially important. In addition to supporting the development of an improved EU database, the Department is working with the Marine Institute and BIM to review available data and develop methodologies which would more reliably quantify existing estimates of catches in the Irish 200 mile limit.Given the level of fishing activity within the Irish 200 mile limit, I assure the House that the relevant Irish authorities work in close co-operation to ensure that all fishing vessels operating within the Irish 200 mile limit are strictly monitored and controlled at sea and in port.

In the region of 2,850 vehicles are required daily covering approximately 5,600 routes to school.The vast majority of the school transport users are satisfied with the service provided. A number of users appeal to my Department each year for changes to be made in the delivery of the service to meet their needs. In order to increase transparency in the delivery of the system and to demonstrate to our customers that such appeals are treated in an efficient and objective manner, an independent appeals board will be established.The new board will commence operation from the beginning of the next school year in September. At present, proposals regarding the membership of the board and the terms of reference under which it will operate are being developed.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The transition year programme was offered in the current school year to 22,772 students in 502 schools. It is operated in accordance with guidelines issued to schools by my Department. The choice of whether to offer the programme is a matter for the school. It is also up to the school to decide whether to make it compulsory for all students in the particular year group or to invite pupils to participate and carry  out a selection process according to criteria developed by the school. In-service support is offered to schools, where the programme is in place, by the transition year curriculum support service. This consists of a five person team of seconded teachers working within the structure of the second level support service.I am broadly happy with how the present arrangements for the programme are operating. A major evaluation of the programme was carried out by my Department's inspectorate in 146 schools offering it in 1994-95 school year. This showed that most schools offering the programme used the freedom afforded in a responsible and creative manner. Under the heading quality of teaching and learning, 88% of the schools evaluated performed well or very well. Weaknesses emerged in two areas. First, in the assessment of pupils' work, 19% of schools evaluated were considered to be weak. Second, in the evaluation of the programme by the school, 25% of schools needed to do more work. My Department has followed up on this evaluation report in a number of ways including ongoing evaluation of the programme in schools and support to schools in the area of assessment of pupils' work and evaluation of the programme by the schools.The Education Research Centre, Drumcondra, carried out a longitudinal study for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on 1994 junior certificate students who sat their leaving certificate examination in 1997. This study provided useful evidence that the programme enhances students' performance at leaving certificate level by 26 points, offsets the handicap of disadvantage and makes students more ready to attempt higher level papers in their leaving certificate examinations.All programmes need ongoing review and the transition year programme is no exception. At present the NCCA is carrying out a review of the arrangements for senior cycle in second level schools. It is also examining the possibility of merging the elements of the programme which are most beneficial in a more streamlined senior cycle. The review group's report will be published in the autumn. It will be presented to me following public consultation and amendment. I will then consider in detail the future of the transition year programme in that context.

These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education  committees' scholarships scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.Given the nature of the student support schemes and the application, means testing and disbursement processes involved, officials of my Department have engaged with officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to options for the future administration of the various student support schemes. Consideration has been given to a proposal that a transfer of responsibility for the operation of the maintenance grants schemes to a single agency or body, such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, might be administratively more appropriate. This view has been endorsed by the Cromien Report of October 2000 on the review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs and by the report of the action group on access to third level education which was published in July 2001.The Deputy will be aware that the time frame for delivering on the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government is the term of office of the Government. When I have had an opportunity of considering the range of issues involved in implementing the commitment I would expect to be in a position to arrive at a more definitive time frame.The Deputy will also appreciate that there are major implications for the local authorities and vocational education committees, for example, in any proposals to change the administration of the maintenance grants schemes. I intend to make sure there is consultation with all interested parties and that no irrevocable decisions are taken in relation to future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place.

The approved syllabus for a subject is issued to schools along with guidelines for teachers which indicate the depth of treatment recommended for the various topics within a syllabus. As part of the in-service programme for teachers, which normally accompanies the introduction of a new syllabus, a draft sample paper of sample questions is issued for discussion. The Department subsequently issues a sample paper which reflects the agreed consensus regarding the structure, format and layout of the paper, choice of questions and mark allocation.When an examination paper is being finalised it is important that the questions are based on the syllabus content. The examination paper in a given year does not ask questions on each and every topic within a syllabus. There are changes from year to year in the range of topics that is examined and occasionally in the type of question that is used to examine aspects of a given topic.When the examination is held, all observations concerning the examination paper that are received from subject associations, teacher unions, parents, teachers and candidates are forwarded to the chief examiner in advance of the marking conference. The marking scheme is developed at the conference by the examining team drawn from teachers of the subject. In this way experienced teachers are able to input their considered views into the framing and development of the marking scheme. It would be inappropriate for me or any other politician to interfere in the work of the chief examiners and the examining teams.

This includes a mix of totally new second level schools, significant extensions, PE halls and other improvement projects.Second, it will be applied to cover the costs that will arise this year in more than 80 projects that are part of the approved programme and planned to go to site in the remaining months of this year. These start-ups include new schools, extensions and other extensive improvement works. The allocation will also cover more than 160 smaller improvement projects planned to start in the course of the year.

One of the most important measures to be taken in this regard is the provision of resources to facilitate schools in the early identification and diagnosis of pupils' reading difficulties. Schools have already been provided with copies of the Drumcondra English profiles. These instruments can be used in addition to standardised, norm referenced tests to enable teachers to build up a profile of each pupil's strengths and weaknesses. The use of the profiles enables teachers to plan reading, writing and language programmes to suit the individual needs of each pupil.Arrangements are also being made that all primary classes from first to sixth will be given support for the purchase of standardised, norm referenced tests of literacy. These tests will assist schools in the early identification of pupils with reading difficulties. Through their use each school will also be able to compare its own results with national norms.School staff will be able to set improvement targets to be achieved within a stated time frame in their school plans. This measure is literally designed to increase the numbers of pupils who function in the higher achievement bands and reduce the number of pupils who function at a low level or who exhibit difficulties.This approach of building the capacity of schools to administer and, crucially, act upon assessments is the best means of proceeding and helping pupils to attain higher standards.At post-primary level, grants are available towards the cost of test materials for use in second level schools with recognised guidance and-or remedial teachers. The grants cover 75% of the cost of materials purchased by the school subject to maximum amounts based on the size of the school. The scheme is restricted to the purchase of published tests and the necessary carriage charges and duties associated with the purchase.I have asked my Department to consider the best method of extending support to schools for the purchase of age related literacy tests as committed to in An Agreed Programme for Government. Details of how this commitment will be implemented will be communicated to schools in due course.

It is not possible to be precise about the combined capacity of those schools. My Department estimates that the overall current enrolment is close to capacity at 3,465 pupils.My Department's planning and building unit is monitoring primary school provision in the Lucan area on an ongoing basis and, in particular, the demand for school places emanating from the new housing developments in the Griffeen area. As part of the monitoring process regular consultations are being held with South Dublin County Council. It has been established that approximately 3,500 houses have been built in the area in the past four years. On foot of these consultations a site for a primary school has been reserved by the county council at Griffeen valley for future primary school purposes.The options for meeting the primary school accommodation needs of the area in the short to medium term have also been examined recently. After careful consideration it was decided that reconfiguring the existing school in the area, Archbishop Ryan national school, as a junior and senior school, each comprising of 16 classrooms, would greatly facilitate the anticipated growth in enrolment. This configuration has the agreement of the school patron and the board of management. It has been established that a site adjoining the school property, which the board of management currently rents from South Dublin County Council, would be suitable for the purposes of building a new school. My Department's planning and building unit is currently investigating the acquisition of this site.My Department is also at an advanced stage in processing an application from the patron body Educate Together for a new primary school in Griffeen. Provided some outstanding matters regarding interim accommodation arrangements can be resolved, I should be in a position to grant recognition to this school from September next. Assuming the school develops as envisaged by the promoters it will add to the overall capacity in the area.Sites have also been reserved for school purposes in the Adamstown area. My officials are in contact with the county council planners with regard to the nature, scale and timeframe of proposed developments in the area.The situation in Lucan will be continually monitored to ensure there is an adequate number of places.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Children in the primary system can experience learning difficulties as a result of a variety of factors. Such difficulties can also vary significantly in intensity.My Department currently recognises a range of conditions which can give rise to learning difficulties among children in the primary system. The conditions in question include: physical disability; hearing impairment; visual impairment; emotional disturbance and-or behavioural problems; attention deficit disorder; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; borderline-mild general learning disability; moderate general learning disability; severe-profound general learning disability; autism-autistic spectrum disorders; specific learning disability; specific speech and language disorder and multiple disabilities.Qualified primary school teachers are trained to identify children who may be encountering learning difficulties. In some cases the nature of the difficulty may be such as to be capable of being addressed by the learning support teacher. Since 1999 the learning support teacher service has been extended to all primary schools. At present there are 1,488 learning support teachers in the primary system.Where the difficulties appear to be of a more serious nature arrangements can be made to have the child assessed. The National Educational Psychological Service was established in 1999 and has responsibility for conducting such assessments.Children identified as having special educational needs on the basis of professional assessments have access to a range of support services. Depending on the nature and level of difficulty involved, such children may be placed in special schools, in special classes attached to ordinary schools or in integrated settings with appropriate support.There are 108 special schools and approximately 500 special classes in the primary system. Each of these facilities is dedicated to a particular special needs category and enjoys significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios which range from 6:1 to 11:1.Children whose difficulties are less severe may be capable of attending ordinary primary schools on a fully integrated basis. Such children can be supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. At present there are approximately 1,700 resource teachers and 3,300 special needs assistants in the primary system.

These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since 1997. It has been increased from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €101.58 per pupil in this school year. In addition a further increase of €10 per pupil will apply from September in respect of the 2002-03 school year.Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These special rates can range from €359.34 to €579 per pupil depending on the level of need involved. These rates will increase by €10 per pupil with effect from September. Under the devolved scheme of minor works each primary school receives an annual grant of €3,809 together with €12.70 per pupil.At post-primary level the main per capita grant amounts to €256.49 per pupil. The grant was increased from €224.74 to €233.63 in 1999. It was further increased by €10.16 to €243.79 in September 2000, and to €256.49 in September 2001. A further increase of €10 is due from September next in respect of the 2002-03 school year which will bring the rate per pupil to €266.49. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra €20,875 per annum and a total capitation grant of €133,245 towards general expenses. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to €152,290.

My officials are not aware of any difficulties in relation to other such schools.The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for patron bodies to decide upon the ethos that will apply in individual schools. Neither I nor my Department have any wish to interfere in such matters.My Department does not lay down a religious education curriculum at primary level. It is a matter for the patron to outline the religious education programme which it expects the school to follow under its patronage and to determine how the programme should be taught. My Department's only stipulation is that a minimum of 30 minutes per day must be allocated to the teaching and implementing of religious education curricula.In an effort to resolve the difficulties in the school, my predecessor offered the parties the possibility of a facilitation process. This was accepted by all concerned and a series of meetings under this process has already taken place. An interim report is expected in the first week of July.

A number of efforts to resolve the dispute have not succeeded, for example, by the Public Service Arbitration Board and the Labour Court. Both bodies essentially recommended that the ASTI claim be dealt with through the Public Service Benchmarking Body. The benchmarking body is due to report next week. I hope its recommendations will form the basis for the resolution of the current dispute.In an effort to find a solution to ASTI's 30% pay claim the issues were referred to the Public Service Arbitration Board. On the rejection of the findings of the arbitration board by ASTI the parties agreed to refer the matter to the Labour Court. Once again ASTI rejected the outcome. The essence of both recommendations was that ASTI should pursue its claim through the Public Service Benchmarking Body. However, ASTI has steadfastly refused to engage in that process. The non-participation of ASTI in the benchmarking process, while regretful, has not hampered the benchmarking body in carrying out a full examination of the role of the teaching profession. Its report will issue before the end of June.

Virtually all second level schools offer science to their students. In senior cycle provisional data for the current school year indicates that 96.6% of schools provide biology, while 75.1% provide chemistry and 78.7% provide physics.My Department has an ongoing programme of school building and development, including laboratory provision. Schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project.In addition to providing laboratory space, my Department also provides grants towards the purchase of equipment. As part of the physical sciences initiative, initiated in 1999 and currently being implemented by my Department, schools have received grants in excess of €13,000 towards the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment. These grants are in addition to annual per capita grants that are made available to schools.The task force on the physical sciences was set up in the autumn of 2000 to examine all issues related to the low take-up rates in the physical sciences, including provision. Earlier this year it prepared a report which has now been circulated for consultation. The consultation period extends to 1 September. At that stage my Department will initiate an implementation process based on the recommendations contained in the report and on submissions received.

Mechanisms are in place to take on board genuine concerns which interested parties, including schools and students, might have in relation to the examinations. Over and above any individual observations submitted, as a matter of course, each year subject associations and the teacher unions regularly provide observations on question paper content to the Department in advance of each marking conference. All observations received in relation to a subject are made available to the chief examiner for consideration in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject. The marking scheme is finalised at the marking conference by the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are drawn from the teachers of the subject. In the case of biology, experienced teachers acting as examiners will be able to input their considered views into the framing of the marking scheme.As it has been the practice for a number of years to publish the detailed marking schemes ultimately used in the marking process, all interested parties will be able to satisfy themselves in relation to the marking process that applies in the case of biology this year. Any candidate who chooses to view his or her marked scripts will have access to the marking scheme. They will be able to see at first hand how the marking scheme was applied in their case.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	383	My officials are in regular contact  with the planning department of South Dublin County Council regarding proposed developments in the Adamstown area of Lucan. The county council has produced an area plan for Adamstown in which there are two sites reserved for primary schools and one site for a postprimary school.In recent discussions with the council regarding Adamstown it emerged that the bulk of housing developments will not commence until the necessary infrastructure is in place and this is expected to be in 2004 at the earliest. Accordingly, my Department has no immediate plans to develop the post-primary site. However, developments in the area are being monitored regularly by my officials so that a timely decision regarding acquisition of the site can be taken.With regard to existing post-primary provision in Lucan, the position is that a building project at St. Joseph's College has been given sanction to proceed to tender. Tenders have already been sought for the building project at Coláiste Phádraig. A building project to provide a permanent school building for Coláiste Cois Life is currently at stage 3 or developed sketch scheme of the architectural design process.In order to monitor post-primary enrolments in Lucan my Department's planning and building unit meets on a regular basis with the principals of the four post-primary schools in the area. This forum assists to a significant degree in optimising the use of existing school capacity so as to ensure that pupils in the Lucan area are able to obtain a place in a local post-primary school.I am satisfied that my Department's current approach, involving the provision of additional accommodation, liaison with the local authority and existing providers, and the reservation of sites will ensure that emerging demand in the Adamstown area is addressed in a timely manner.

This will be used to fund this year's primary school building programme. I am satisfied that the funding available is sufficient to cater for this year's extensive programme.The programme includes more than 200 projects currently under construction or planned to go to construction before the end of the year. In addition, grant aid will be provided for a range of smaller works. To date 700 such grants have been approved at a cost of €21 million and it is anticipated that this rate of expenditure will continue for the rest of the year.

The EU Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is the main European instrument for funding international collaborative research activities; the Sixth Framework Programme, which will run from 2003-06, will allocate more than €16 billion for research activities over a wide range of areas which includes genomics and biotechnology for health, including research to combat major diseases; and information society technologies, nanotechnologies and nanosciences, food quality and safety, sustainable development, global change and ecosystems. A fundamental aim of the programme is to enhance EU competitiveness over the next four to five years. It also aims to contribute to the establishment of a European research area which would effectively compete with the significant research effort of the USA and Japan. The framework programme operates on the basis of an open call for proposals which are then assessed on a competitive basis by an international panel of experts.The Office of Science and Technology appoints national delegates to the management committees which oversee the framework programme. These national delegates also promote Irish interest and encourage Irish participation in their respective programme areas.COST or Co-operation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research is a Europe-wide network comprising more than 30 countries. It encourages co-operation between nationally funded basic research activities from participating countries to address common research goals. Irish researchers are involved in approximately 80 of the 150 ongoing COST actions in a wide range of research domains including the following: telecommunications; transport; materials; meteorology; social sciences; urban civil engineering; chemistry; forests and forestry product; agriculture and biotechnology; information science and technology; environment; medicine and health; and nanosciences. Irish participation in these action programmes is managed by Enterprise Ireland.

The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from £45 or €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €105.00 per pupil in this school year. This represented an increase of 84% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level over the period. The standard rate will be further increased to €111.58 in respect of the coming 2002-03 school year.

In general the allocation to a school is determined by the number of students attending it. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more pupils are entitled to a full post. Those with an enrolment of less than 600 are entitled to the equivalent of half of a post for remedial education. Schools with enrolments of less than 600 which were specifically allocated a full post in respect of remedial education by my Department prior to the 1999-2000 school year retain their entitlement to an allocation of a full post.

There are currently about 100 schools on this list out of a total of almost 3,200 primary schools.The criteria used by the INTO in determining which schools are substandard are unclear. It is not clear from the information supplied by the INTO who compiles the reports and the level of technical input, if any, involved in the assessments. While the INTO has raised concerns about 100 schools my Department is currently dealing with a primary capital programme involving more than 600 major school projects under construction, about to go to tender or in architectural planning.Many of the specific issues raised by the INTO, that is hand washing-drying facilities, heating, replacement of windows and doors, and water supply, are more appropriately dealt with at local school management level by using the devolved capital grant for primary schools. All primary schools now receive an annual capital grant of €3,809 per school plus €12.70 per pupil at a total cost in excess of €17 million per annum. The expenditure of this money is entirely at the discretion of the boards of management.I intend to audit the performance of local boards of management of the schools on the list in relation to this grant and how it is spent to try to ensure value for money.My Department currently has more than 400 major projects at primary level in architectural planning, including many of those identified by the INTO. These projects will proceed through the planning stages and will be programmed for construction on the basis of the available financial resources. My Department's planning and building unit regularly meets the INTO to provide information about the overall progress of the primary capital programme.

This is true under a number of headings. The junior certificate and leaving certificate syllabi are now set out under notional-functional headings. In other words, they stress what the learner should be able to do with the language as a result of his-her learning. The four language-skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing are all given due weighting both in the teaching-learning and in the assessment of Irish. The teaching methodology implied by the syllabi is based on a communicative approach identical to that suggested in the syllabi for the modern languages. Finally, the prescription of literature is kept to a manageable level.The syllabi studied in our schools are all prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment course committees. Representatives of the teaching profession sit on these committees and contribute to the design of the syllabus. Review of all syllabi, including Irish, is an integral part of the work of the NCCA.In addition to the normal work of syllabus review of the NCCA, An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta was set up in December 2001 and held its inaugural meeting recently. Its brief includes conducting research and advising the NCCA on matters relating to the teaching of Irish. I will follow its work with interest and I await any proposals it might make in relation to the teaching and learning of Irish.

The extent to which integration can be achieved is ultimately dictated by the needs and abilities of the child.Students who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. These services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes-units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools with special back-up supports.Children attending on an integrated basis are supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. At present there are approximately 1,700 resource teachers and 3,300 special needs assistants in place in primary schools supporting children with special educational needs on an integrated basis. The level of support in this area has grown enormously in recent years.Where more serious special needs are involved children may require placement in a special school or special dedicated class attached to an ordinary school. There are 108 special schools and approximately 500 special classes in the primary system. Each facility is dedicated to a particular disability group and operates at a specially reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Pupils attending such facilities also attract special rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and the school bus escort service.

In accordance with long established policy on public service pensions, an increase in the pay of a serving teacher which involves a restructuring of duties or a restructuring of the basis for determining salary or allowances will not be passed on to a teacher who retired before the date from which the restructuring increase became effective in pay. With this exception, increases in the pay of serving teachers are reflected in the pensions of retired teachers.The question of pension increase policy generally has been considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The commission has recommended in its final report that pensions of public servants should continue to be increased in line with public service earnings. It has also recommended that serving public servants make an explicit contribution towards the cost involved.In a change from the existing form of pay parity, the commission proposes that a single index of public service earnings be used in the future. It also proposes that pension increases based on changes in the index be paid automatically on a twice yearly basis. The operation of the index will mean that pensions will be increased by reference to the average of pay increases across the public service rather than by reference to increases in the pay of the specific grade from which the pensioner has retired. The operation of the index will also mean that the present distinction between restructuring increases and other pay increases will no longer be relevant.

This initiative is in accordance with both the recommendations of the recent report of the expert group on the allocation of teachers to second level schools and the report by Mr. Sean Cromien into the operations of my Department. The appeals forum will consider appeals from school management authorities for additional teaching resources where particular problems arise for schools in meeting essential curricular commitments within their normal staffing provision. It is planned that the new forum will consider appeals with effect from the 2003-04 school year staffing allocations.Detailed arrangements for the operation of the appeal system are currently being developed by my Department. All second level school authorities will be advised about them.Mr. Jim Lyons, the recently retired chief executive officer of the County Clare Vocational Education Committee, has been appointed as chairman of the appeals forum.

This includes more than 600 projects either in construction, about to go to construction or at various stages of architectural planning.Decisions on additional projects proceeding to architectural planning and construction are taken in the light of the annual allocation for capital projects, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects. The programme for 2002 was published by my predecessor earlier this year on my Department's website and it will be updated from time to time.Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, I will frame a further comprehensive programme.

He also wanted to establish effective links with higher and further education institutions in order to address the related problems of non-completion at second level education and low participation rates in higher education.Following further consideration of the matter it was decided last year to proceed with plans to develop outreach centres in Wexford and Kilkenny. The position has already been outlined to the Deputy in October 2001 and last January. The proposals for similar initiatives in other areas, including Skibbereen, will be reviewed in the light of the experience gained from the development of the centres in Wexford and Kilkenny and in the context of the resources which are available.

However, it must be recognised that there are real constraints on making any significant improvement in respect of the junior certificate if the issue date of the leaving certificate is not to be affected. Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners, my Department ensures that the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met. This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides, where necessary, additional time to examiners undertaking the marking of the junior certificate.I am sure the Deputy will agree that priority must be given to the issue of the leaving certificate results so as to ensure that the CAO college entry process executes in a timely manner.It is intended to issue the results of this year's junior certificate examination during the week commencing 9 September.

This will be achieved through a multi-annual programme to be called the schools' modernisation fund. This scheme will be financed through the National Development Finance Agency and the maximum use of public private partnership arrangements as appropriate.Last January my Department started preparing a comprehensive inventory of accommodation in order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in all schools. This pilot scheme includes the production of site and building survey drawings and general building condition reports of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The resulting information will be compiled on a geographic information system database.Each school in the pilot area will be surveyed by suitably qualified personnel who will assess and report on site conditions, space norms within the schools and the overall condition of each school. All of the data accumulated will be stored electronically on the GIS database and used to prioritise capital funding for first and second level projects.The pilot project is expected to be completed by September. It is intended to use experience gained in the pilot phase of the project to expand the inventory nationwide.

In particular, they are monitoring the demand for school places emanating from the new housing developments in the Griffeen area.

During my term of office I am determined to significantly improve the literacy levels of all school leavers.The teacher guidelines that accompany the English curriculum for primary schools recommend a range of teaching methods designed to improve children's reading and writing abilities. The Primary Curriculum Support Service has been engaged in disseminating the content and methodologies recommended in these guidelines. I will support the implementation of the curriculum by continuing the regional training support service so that each school can gain ready access to the training required to meet the needs of its teaching staff.I draw the Deputy's attention to the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in our primary schools. This will facilitate teachers in catering for the needs of pupils and in giving greater attention to children who have literacy difficulties. Every school will receive support for the purchase of appropriate age related literacy tests to assist teachers in monitoring children's literacy development.

This unprecedented level of investment will be expended on the programme of work set out for the year. I am satisfied the programme in place is consistent with the allocation.First, the funding will be applied to finish 125 projects where work has been under way. This includes a mix of totally new second level schools, significant extensions, PE halls and other improvement projects.Second, it will be applied to cover the costs that will arise this year in relation to over 80 projects that are part of the approved programme and planned to go to site in the remaining months of this year. These start-ups include new schools, extensions and other extensive improvement works. The allocation will also cover over 160 smaller improvement projects planned to start in the course of the year.

The commission recommended a lengthier, more thorough and time bound procedure for processing applications for the recognition of new primary schools. It also recommended that provision be made for appeal of the decision regarding any such application.It is proposed that new criteria and procedures based on the commission's recommendations will come into effect in the case of schools seeking recognition from September 2003 onwards. These arrangements will include an independent appellate structure.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Funding of schools at both primary and second level is structured on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants towards services such as caretaking and secretarial.At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools.This Government places a high priority on increasing funding to schools. Recent developments include, at primary level, significant improvement in the level of capitation grants. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €105.00 per pupil in this school year. In addition, the standard rate will be increased to €111.58 in respect of the 2002-03 school year.At post-primary level, schools have also benefited from increases in the standard per capita grant. The grant has been increased from €224.74 per pupil in 1997 to €256.49 from September last. The grant will be further increased by €10 for the next school year and that will bring the grant to €266.49. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra €20,875 per annum and a total capitation grant of €133,245 towards general expenses. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to €152,290. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. In my view this is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The extensive building programme published by my predecessor earlier this year was sub-divided into projects either in construction, approved to go to tender, tenders accepted, works during the summer holiday period or at various stages of architectural planning. The estimated expenditure on the building programme for 2002 is €172.6 million at primary level and €183.729 at second level.The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible to provide precise information in relation to the length of time it will take to complete all those projects published on the schools building programme except for those projects approved for works during the summer holiday period. These are expected to be completed later this year. The completion of all other projects depends on a number of factors such as the size and complexity of the project, the length of time it takes to complete architectural planning, site acquisition issues where relevant, the local authority planning process and the commitments to be met within the annual financial allocation.Later this year, when the annual financial allocations have been made for the school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, I will frame a further comprehensive programme of works that will proceed to construction. I intend to publish this programme at that time.

EU law prevents me and my Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.The Government intends to tackle the high costs of insurance by way of the comprehensive set of measures which we have put forward in our agreed programme for Government. An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement urgently the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.An implementation group was set up at the end of April and is making good progress on preparation of an action plan to give effect to the 67 recommendations. The action plan, which I intend to make publicly available, will contain a target timeframe for implementation of each recommendation by the Department or body concerned.The new programme for Government also contains a commitment to establish the personal injuries assessment board. To that end, I expect shortly to present to the Government, in accordance with the usual procedures, the report of the interdepartmental implementation group. I can confirm that I received its report recently. I intend to make the report public after it has been considered by the Government.The social partners have committed themselves in recent partnership proposals to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. As part of this commitment, the workplace safety group, which enjoys the support of the HSA and social partners, is promoting a workplace safety code on safe working and accident prevention. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The establishment of an office to promote workplace safety with a chief executive and administrative assistant has been proposed. My Department will be involved in providing financial and other assistance towards getting this initiative off the ground.

They provide a single point of contact and information at local level and support individuals as well as small enterprises and community groups with commercially viable projects.While the type of project described by the Deputy might not qualify for start-up capital due to the nature of the business and the issue of displacement, other services may be available. Services provided by boards may include the provision of advice and assistance in setting up a business, grant aided training programmes on book-keeping, tax courses, VAT, health and safety, pricing and costing, cashflow forecasting, sales and marketing and employment legislation. In addition, the boards may advise on relevant services available from other agencies.

As a general rule, the special increment continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension at age 65 or old age contributory pension at age 66, at which stage the increment ceases to be payable. The personal rate of either social welfare pension is considerably greater than the maximum special increment. Exceptionally, the increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner who was discharged prior to 1 August 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a social welfare retirement pension.The current arrangements are in accordance with the principle of integrating occupational benefits with social insurance benefits in the case of employees, such as NCOs and privates, who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts. The method of integration used in the case of NCOs and privates is more advantageous than the standard method of full integration applicable in other public service employments.

Poultry meat produced in a European Union country may be traded freely between EU countries provided it has been produced in a manner that complies with the relevant health and marketing rules. Common rules apply throughout the EU and these include the requirement that product be produced in an approved establishment, the hygiene standards to be observed, and labelling specifications. Where an additive has been included in a product this must be declared on the retail label. There is no prohibition on the inclusion of additives in a product provided that the additive is not a banned substance and does not pose a risk to animal and public health.Imports from third or non-EU countries are subject to strict rules governing the importation of such products as established under EU harmonised legislation. In particular, the country of origin and the establishment in which the poultry meat was produced must be approved in advance by the EU Commission. The granting of approvals is dependent on such factors as the poultry health status of the country, adequacy of its veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices. Third country production plants are inspected by veterinary experts from EU countries before approval is given.

Following an examination of the application it was found that he sold six cows within the retention period and replaced  them with two cows and four heifers. On 15 April the person named was informed that as he retained a total of 14 cows only for the entire retention period only three heifers could be accepted giving a total of 17 eligible animals on which a reduction penalty would be applied under the terms and conditions of the scheme. The person named requested a review of this decision. Correspondence dated 22 June issued to the person named informing him of the outcome of the review, that is the original decision was upheld and allowing him 21 days to write to the agriculture appeals office if he wished to appeal the decision.

In the course of a subsequent full plan check, however, my Department became aware that a lease for 38.2 hectares included in his application was not stamped and did not have Land Commission consent at the time of his initial application to the scheme.The REPS specifications state that where leased land is included in an application, a REPS planner should be satisfied that an applicant has available, for inspection by an authorised person, a certified copy of lease agreement(s) for any lands deemed eligible for payment under the scheme, registered with the Irish Land Commission and stamped by the Revenue Commissioners. Since his REPS contract began on 1 April 1998, the person named could not have complied with this requirement as the lease was not stamped until 12 December 2001 and Land Commission consent was not granted until 9 January 2002.My Department has considered the matter fully, together with submissions made on behalf of the person named by his legal advisers, but it has been concluded that the leased land must be deemed ineligible for payment. It was also noted that the applicant had sold other lands to an individual who is not a REPS participant. It is a condition of REPS that lands which are the subject of an application under the scheme must be farmed in accordance with the REPS specifications for a period of five years. Where there is a reduction in the area except by way of transfer to another REPS participant or through the implementation of an afforestation programme payments made in respect of the lands in question must be refunded.

Following the fire the nature and scope of insurance cover on the beef intervention stock was reviewed by independent consultants on behalf of the Department and the following upgraded conditions have applied since then: tender documents require the successful tenderer to furnish original policy documents; the identity of the insurer and its regulatory authority must be given in the tender documents and in the case of a collective policy, the insurers and each insurer's percentage of the proposed cover to be held must be stated; the lowest price tendered for the placing of the risk will not necessarily be accepted; a full assessment of the broker's ability to place the risk is made and confirmation of the broker's professional indemnity insurance is sought; as long as market conditions allow, multiple layering in placing the risk is to be avoided and where possible the lead insurer in the placement will be subject to Irish regulatory control.In addition to these specific measures the EU freedom of services regulation now governs the manner in which EU insurers transact cross border business. This had not been implemented in 1989-1990 and the activities of insurance brokers are now regulated by the new Central Bank Regulations.

The issue of compensation for losses incurred is a matter to be resolved between creditors and the liquidator. It would not be appropriate for the Government to intervene in what is a commercial matter.I am aware of the impact of the collapse of the company on local farmers. This type of situation should be avoided if at all possible and the practice adopted by the majority of meat factories of paying for cattle on the day of sale substantially limits the potential exposure of farmers in the event of a slaughterhouse going into liquidation.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	435	Ireland imports an extensive range of meat products from other member states and from third countries. Imports from third, ie non-EU countries are subject to strict rules governing the importation of such products as established under EU harmonised legislation. In particular, the country of origin and the establishment in which the poultry meat was produced must be approved in advance by the EU Commission. Granting approvals is dependent on such factors as the animal health status of the country, adequacy of its veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices. Third country production plants are inspected by veterinary experts from EU countries before approval is given.The relevant rules provide that responsibility for official inspections of meat imports from third countries rests with the authorities in the member state where the product first arrives in the EU. Such inspections should include checks on accompanying documents and on identity and labelling as well as random physical checks on the product itself. Where importation is authorised, thereafter the meat may circulate freely within the EU. The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health of the European Commission constantly monitors events in member states and third countries which are likely to have implications for public health.The framework of veterinary checks provided for by harmonised EU rules, the implementation of those rules by my Department and the veterinary services of other member states, together with the constant programme of monitoring and review of public health risks provided for under the aegis of the standing committee, are intended to provide assurance that imported animal products are fit for human consumption, while allowing member states to fulfil their trade obligations as members of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.

The bonuses constitute emoluments for the purposes of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and reckonable earnings for the purposes of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. Consequently, PAYE and PRSI including the employer's contribution and the health contribution, where relevant, must be deducted by the employer from the bonuses at the time of payment and subsequently remitted to the Collector General.I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the bonuses in question arise from a formal arrangement established in recent years whereby the Irish Horse Racing Association, the IHRA formerly the Turf Club, withholds 3% of prize money from race winnings and this is subsequently paid over to the winning horse trainer's stables for distribution to the stable staff.

The UMP case involved a complex series of legal issues relating to liability, quantum and jurisdiction, many of which are particular to that case. I am not certain therefore that lessons from this case will necessarily translate to other areas of the State sector. However, I understand that following the Ballaghaderreen fire, a review of the nature and scope of insurance cover on the beef intervention stock was undertaken by independent consultants, on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture Food and Rural Development, and that upgraded conditions have been applied since then. I will consult with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to consider, in light of the review undertaken by his Department, whether any improved practices or procedures can be usefully adopted by other State agencies in the future.

The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria. The Deputy will appreciate that the work of this review group is very complex. As part of its deliberations, the group has heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and has received more than 260 written submissions from interested parties.I have been informed there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those which are covered by the scheme, and those with medical conditions covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.Many factors have to be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. Any proposals, whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise, which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration.

The report was published in March 2002.The principal recommendation in the final report is that responsibility for the co-ordination of management of the River Shannon catchment should be assigned to the Western Development Commission. The subcommittee also recommended that the western investment fund should be increased by approximately €25 million to provide a reserve for special and emergency work in relation to the Shannon. I have brought the report to the attention of the Department of Rural Community and Gaeltacht Affairs for consideration and any action it considers appropriate.I am very conscious of the difficulties being caused by the exceptional level of rainfall for various interests, especially farmers, in the Shannon catchment and elsewhere, and I have visited the area and seen the effects of the flooding. I have met local groups and I have invited proposals from them which I will discuss immediately with the Commissioners of Public Works with a view to seeing what action may be possible to alleviate the problems.

Last year, the rate dropped to 1.64% due, at least in part, to the impact of the foot and mouth crisis and the aftermath of 11 September.During the period January to May 2002, almost 195,000 applications were received by the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. This represents a 10.39% increase on the same period last year. It is not possible to say how much of this extra demand is due to the introduction of a new security policy by the airline company to which the Deputy refers.To cater for the extra demand for passports, the Passport Office has taken a number of steps including the recruitment of additional staff and increasing the level of service in the public offices. In addition, a project is being developed to modernise the entire passport issuing system. This will enable the provision of a more efficient and more effective service to the public.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The European Council meeting at Seville on 21-22 June, with a view to improving the functioning of the council in the run-up to enlargement, decided to create a new General Affairs and External Relations Council. This will deal, inter alia, with the whole of the Union's external action, including development co-operation and humanitarian aid.While Ireland had not been pressing for change in this area, the integration of development issues into the agenda for the new council is acceptable to us, for a number of reasons. Very importantly, in Ireland's view, the change allows for development Ministers to participate as full members of the new council when development matters are to be discussed, and that agendas and the organisation of proceedings will be adjusted accordingly.Dealing with development issues at the regular meetings of the new Council, rather than, as previously, at the twice yearly meetings of the Development Council, will ensure greater attention to development policy in general and the paramount objective of poverty eradication. The new approach will also give greater coherence to the EU's foreign, development and trade policies. For example, the treatment of cross-cutting issues such as conflict prevention, human rights and poverty reduction to which Ireland attaches high priority should benefit from this more coherent approach.

Under this scheme, co-ordinators are assigned to schools in disadvantaged areas to work with school staff, parents and relevant community agencies in advancing the educational interests of children. The scheme seeks to address the discontinuity between the children's home and community experiences and the demands of schooling by maximising active participation of targeted pupils in the learning process and by promoting active co-operation and collaboration between home, school and community. A national co-ordinator oversees the day-to-day operation of the scheme and promotes its development.At present there are 309 primary schools and 211 second level schools included in the home school community liaison scheme. Some €589,909.11 was expended on this scheme at primary level and €503,243.22 at post primary level in 2001, exclusive of teachers salaries. It is projected that a similar amount will be expended in 2002.The home school community liaison scheme is currently being reviewed by the Educational Research Centre. In addition to examining the impact of the scheme and how efficiently and effectively the scheme has achieved its objectives, this review will help to inform future policy and practice in relation to the development of school, family and community linkages as a means of addressing educational disadvantage. I expect that the Educational Research Centre will have completed its work and submitted a report to my Department by the end of July.

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school referred to by the Deputy was 80 pupils on 30 September 2002. This enrolment entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for  the 2002-03 school year. The enrolment figure for the appointment of a third teacher is 82 pupils. Unfortunately, in this instance a third mainstream teacher cannot be sanctioned.The school in question currently shares a learning support teacher post with three other schools. I understand the total enrolment of the schools on the caseload of the learning support teacher is 307 pupils. I am continuing to keep the learning support provision under review. The needs of the school in question will be taken fully into account in the event of additional learning support teacher posts becoming available for distribution.The issue raised by the Deputy in relation to the establishment of a special class for children with autism disorder is the subject of detailed discussions between officials of my Department and representatives of the school in question. I am hopeful that these discussions will lead to a positive outcome so that appropriate support services can be put in place for the children in question as speedily as possible.

I am arranging for a copy of the Irish report to be conveyed to the Deputy.The World Education Forum in Dakar in 2000 presented an opportunity to assess progress in the achievement of the goals in the area of basic education for all set in Jomtien. The forum received inputs from Regional Education for All meetings which also assessed progress in attaining the Jomtien objectives.

A number of approaches have been found to be effective in meeting the educational needs of individual children with autistic spectrum disorder. The intervention applied with individuals should be determined by a full assessment of the pupil's needs. In individual cases where it is determined that ABA would be an appropriate approach, my Department has supported such approaches. These include the establishment of special classes with an applied behavioural analysis component. In addition, my Department is currently funding five projects nationally, which are delivering an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism. My Department recently confirmed its agreement in principle to fund an expansion of one of these projects subject to certain conditions being satisfied.My Department has also co-operated in the provision of ABA training for teachers through the in career development unit. Children with autism have access to a range of special support services. To date, some 90 special classes dedicated to children with autism have been established within the primary sector. Each class operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of at least two special needs assistants. Further such classes are being established on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs.Children with special needs including children with autism attending mainstream schools are generally catered for with the support of a resource teacher and special needs assistant services. The level of support provided in any particular case is determined by the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.

When an examination paper is being finalised, care is taken to ensure that the questions are based on the syllabus content. The examination paper in a given year does not ask questions on each and every topic within a syllabus. There are changes from year to year in the range of topics that is examined, and from time to time in the type of question that is used to examine aspects of a given topic. The current biology syllabus is presented in ten sections and no section of the syllabus was omitted from the higher level examination paper in 2002.All those who had comments or observations to make on any aspect of the leaving certificate higher level biology examination paper were advised to outline their concerns in writing and send them in to the examinations branch of my Department for the attention of the chief examiner in biology. In addition to any individual observations submitted, subject associations and the teacher unions regularly provide observations on question paper content to the Department in advance of each marking conference.All observations received in relation to a subject are made available to the chief examiner for consideration in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject. The marking scheme is finalised at the marking conference by the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are drawn from the teachers of the subject. In the case of biology, experienced teachers, acting as assistant examiners, have been able to input their own considered views into the framing of the marking scheme. Careful testing of the marking scheme is undertaken using randomly selected scripts prior to its finalisation and application to all scripts.As it has been the practice for a number of years to publish the detailed marking schemes ultimately used in the marking process, all interested parties will be able to satisfy themselves in relation to the marking process that applies in the case of biology this year. Furthermore, any candidate who chooses to view his-her marked scripts will have access to the marking scheme and will be able to see at first hand precisely how the marking scheme applied in his-her own case. Because of the concerns raised this year, I have arranged that a chief examiner's report will be published in respect of this year's examination in biology.

As the agreed appointment figure for the third mainstream class teacher is 82 pupils, I regret there is no basis on which I may sanction this post at Brannockstown national school for the 2002-03 school year.A report on the staffing and enrolment at this school was considered recently. However, the school can only obtain an additional teaching post in the 2002-03 school year is if it satisfies the developing school criteria as outlined in paragraph 2 of circular 9/02. If the board of management feels the enrolment on 30 September 2002 will be 99 pupils or more it may apply to the primary payments section of my Department for a developing school post.

This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and one mainstream class teacher for the 2002-03 school year.Unfortunately, I cannot sanction the retention of the second mainstream class teaching post for the 2002-03 school year as the school's enrolment on 30 September 2001 does not meet the retention requirement of 50 pupils. The school shares a resource teaching post with three schools in the locality. The special needs pupils in question are on the caseload of this resource post.

The board of management of each school should have advised parents of the terms of the circular when they received it from my Department.In accordance with the terms outlined in the circular, the principal teacher should consult with the learning support teacher and class teacher of a pupil if an application for retention is received from the parents. If all parties conclude that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for a second year the pupil may be retained.However, a record outlining the educational basis for the decision to retain a pupil in class for a second year should be kept for any pupil so retained. In addition, there should be a clear programme outlined for such a pupil that records precisely what new approach will be used for her-him and what its expected benefit will be. These records should be retained within the school and should be brought to the inspector's attention by the principal when she or he visits the school. A pupil should not be held back for longer than one year in a primary school.

When an examination paper is being finalised, care is taken to ensure that the questions are based on the syllabus content. The examination paper in a given year does not ask questions on each and every topic within a syllabus. There are changes from year to year in the range of topics examined, and from time to time in the type of question used to examine aspects of a given topic. The current biology syllabus is presented in ten sections and no section of the syllabus was omitted from the higher level examination paper in 2002.All those who had comments or observations to make on any aspect of the leaving certificate higher level biology examination paper were advised to outline their concerns in writing and send them in to the examinations branch of my Department for the attention of the chief examiner in biology. In addition to any individual observations submitted, subject associations and the teacher unions regularly provide observations on question paper content to the Department in advance of each marking conference.All observations received in relation to a subject are made available to the chief examiner for consideration in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject. The marking scheme is finalised at the marking conference by the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are drawn from the teachers of the subject. In the case of biology, experienced teachers, acting as assistant examiners, have been able to input their own considered views into the framing of the marking scheme. Careful testing of the marking scheme is undertaken using randomly selected scripts prior to its finalisation and application to all scripts.

The allocation for individual schools for a school year is determined by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding school year. The allocation varies between 44 hours per week for schools with enrolments of 1,000 or more pupils to 8 hours per week in the case of schools with enrolments of less than 200 pupils.There are now more guidance counsellors employed by schools than at any previous time. A total of 630 whole-time teacher equivalents, inclusive of the 50 posts which were allocated under the guidance enhancement initiative, were allocated to second level schools in the 2001-02 school year. As a result, schools, whatever their size, are in a position to ensure that pupils have access to counselling and career guidance by qualified personnel.The question of increasing the allocation to second level schools in respect of guidance will be considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the recommendations of the report of the expert group on the allocation of teachers to second level schools.

These tests are used to assess pupils' progress in literacy and to identify those pupils who function at a low level relative to their peers, and who may need learning support. As part of An Agreed Programme for Government, every school will receive support for the purchase of appropriate age-related literacy tests to assist teachers in monitoring children's literacy development and in identifying learning difficulties at an early stage.A combined approach involving the administration of such norm-referenced, standardised tests and teacher vigilance is the most effective way of identifying learning difficulties at an early stage. In cases where it is felt that the learning difficulties are of a more serious nature, resulting possibly from a disability, the pupil may be referred to the National Educational Psychological Service for individual assessment.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	494	The learning support service provides additional support for pupils who function at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of literacy or mathematics. My Department has already published learning support guidelines for schools, and training for teachers in implementing these guidelines is already being given under the primary curriculum support programme. These guidelines already recommend that an individual profile and learning programme be prepared by teachers, in conjunction with parents, in respect of each child attending learning support.In the case of more serious learning difficulties, or special educational needs, arising from a disability, it is accepted that multi-disciplinary teams of relevant professionals, in consultation with parents, should design individual education plans for pupils. I propose that in legislation I will bring forward to replace the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, the National Council for Special Education will have statutory responsibility for ensuring that each child registered as having special educational needs will have an individual education plan. The school the pupil attends, in conjunction with a special needs organiser of the council, will facilitate the formation of multi-disciplinary teams of professionals and parents, as required.

The level of resource support is established fol lowing consideration of assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals.Resource teacher posts may be sanctioned on a full-time basis, either in a single school or in a cluster of schools, provided there are sufficient children with special educational needs arising from a disability to warrant a full-time post. Alternatively, part-time hours may be sanctioned to provide support teaching for individual children or where there are insufficient children with special educational needs to warrant the allocation of a full-time post.More than 1,700 full-time equivalent resource posts have been allocated to primary schools nation-wide and my Department will continue to extend this service in response to assessed needs.

However, national and international surveys of literacy undertaken during the past decade give a good indication as to the proportions of students who have serious literacy difficulties.In 1990-91 the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, IEA, conducted a reading literacy study in 32 educational systems throughout the world. Irish nine year olds and 14 year olds participated in the study. Both Irish populations scored just above the respective international averages for their age peers. Further analysis of the data from this study by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, Drumcondra, indicated that between 6.5% to 8.5% of Irish 14 year olds had serious literacy difficulties.National surveys of reading in primary schools were carried out in 1972, 1980, 1988, 1993 and 1998 by Department of Education and Science inspectors in co-operation with the ERC. Significant progress in pupils reading achievement was recorded between 1972 and 1980. The most recent survey of reading achievement of pupils in fifth class in 1998 indicated that there has been no significant change in reading standards in the past 20 years. It was estimated from the 1993 survey that between 6.5% to 9.5% of Irish 11 year old pupils have serious literacy difficulties.In 2000, the OECD programme for International Survey of Achievement, PISA, found that the proportion of 15 year old students achieving at level one or below on the combined reading literacy scales was 11%. While this is considerably below the OECD country average of 17.9%, it should not be a cause for complacency.Promotion of high literacy standards is among the highest priorities of the education system and during my term of office, I am determined to significantly improve the literacy levels of all school leavers.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	500	The planning group that prepared proposals for the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, recommended an overall target number of 200 psychologists in the educational system as a whole and 36 administrative and secretarial staff. It also recommended that this target should be achieved over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999-2000. The Government made a decision in early  1999 that these recommendations should be implemented.The NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now more than 80 psychologists in NEPS, in addition to a number of psychologists deployed elsewhere in the educational system, bringing the overall total up to almost 100.The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners have recently conducted a recruitment competition for additional psychologists in NEPS, and 69 successful candidates have been placed on a panel. As the commission clears candidates, my Department is issuing offers of employment. It is envisaged that most of these psychologists will be in post by the end of 2002. Once 43 of them have taken up their employment, the original target set by the Government decision for the year 2002 will have been reached.Currently there are 13 administrative staff assigned to NEPS, including three in specialist IT roles, and further assignments while be made during the current year.

For some pupils the nature of the special need may be such that the child can perform quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a learning support or resource teacher. Where more serious cases of difficulties arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children. Therefore, supports as outlined above are allocated by my Department on a demand led basis and are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child or children.There are currently three special schools and approximately 28 special classes at primary level in County Kildare. The number of resource teachers currently in place at this level equates to approximately 106 whole-time equivalent posts. Special needs assistants amounting to approximately 203 whole-time equivalent posts have also been allocated for the support of special needs pupils at primary level in the county. The number of posts sanctioned nation-wide is increasing weekly based on the professional assessment of children with special needs.Information relating to the number of special needs pupils in mainstream primary education is not readily available in my Department.At second level, my Department allocates resource posts, child care assistant posts and concessionary teaching hours to ordinary second-level schools to cater for special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service.In the 2001-02 school year 12.17 whole-time teacher equivalent posts in concessionary teaching hours were allocated to ordinary second level schools in County Kildare to cater for pupils with special needs.For the 2002-03 school year 12.91 whole-time teacher equivalent posts in concessionary teaching hours have been allocated to date to ordinary second level schools in County Kildare to cater for pupils with special needs.

However, the service to a number of post-primary schools has been curtailed sadly during the past school year due to the death of the assigned psychologist.An additional 26 primary schools are included in a pilot introductory programme and the NEPS service will be extended to them in the next school year, as new psychologists are recruited. These schools were also eligible to avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, as were the remaining primary schools in the county.My Department is making every effort to accelerate the expansion of NEPS and I envisage that it should have reached its target of 200 psychologists within the next school year. At that stage, all schools in the county will have access to the NEPS service.

In relation to other Community waters, where access restrictions apply including the "Irish Box", the Commission has proposed a report by 31 December 2003 on the rules concerning access to resources in these waters, assessing the justification for these rules in terms of conservation and sustainable exploitation objectives.The current restrictive access regime for the "Irish Box" is critical for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks in western waters and I will work to ensure this regime is retained into the future.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 218 together.My Department is already involved in a wide range of partnerships with other Departments and bodies in an effort to tackle the issue of alcohol abuse by young people.Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol.Children are targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called Walk Tall. Adolescents are targeted through the On My Own Two Feet programme which forms part of the social, personal and health education curriculum.In accordance with action 43 of the national drugs strategy, the Department of Education and Science in partnership with the health promotion unit of my Department and the health boards, has recently issued guidelines for developing a school substance abuse policy to all primary and post-primary schools.The national youth health promotion programme with support from the health promotion unit, initiated a national project which provided opportunities for young people aged 14-16 years to explore their relationship with alcohol.The health promotion unit of my Department is currently engaged in a three year alcohol awareness campaign entitled Less is More – It's Your Choice. Some phases of the campaign have focused on; those who buy or supply alcohol to those underage with a poster and radio messages with the theme of keeping children safe from drink; third level students in the restaurants of colleges with some facts on alcohol and a reminder that alcohol can affect one's finances, studies and health; and youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people.In the college setting, universities and third level institutions came together to formulate a response to a growing concern about alcohol promotion practices on campus, high risk drinking among students and its impact on student academic achievement and student attrition. A framework for the development of a college alcohol policy was developed and each third level institution can adopt the guidelines to reflect the needs and aspirations of their own campus environment.

This compares with a figure of 438 for the end of January 2002.The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 contains 100 actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. One of its objectives is to enable people with drug misuse problems to access treatment and other supports in order to re-integrate into society. A target of an increase in the number of treatment places for opiate addiction to a national minimum of 6,500 by the end of 2002 has been set and all health boards are working to extend services to achieve this target. The central treatment list stands at 6,097 as of the end of April 2002, an increase of over 15% compared to May 2001.At present there are 5,936 people in receipt of methadone in the ERHA region. Services are delivered through 55 clinics and by 144 GPs who provide treatment to people in their own locality. As a matter of priority, consideration is being given to how the level of GP and pharmacy involvement in the provision of treatment programmes can be increased. Increased capacity at primary level will have the effect of alleviating the pressure on the clinic services which are currently oversubscribed.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	514	As the Deputy is aware, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health Amendment) (No 3) Act, 1996.In 1997, the funding available for the scheme was £27 million, in 2001, the sum was £52 million and in 2002 the funding available is £72 million –€91.4 million. In recognition of the issues involved, this Department made significant additional resources of more than £1.2 million –€1.5million available to the Southern Health Board at the end of 2001. Furthermore, the Southern Health Board received an additional £3.35 million –€4.24 million this year including a sum of €2.641 million to respond to extra pressures on the scheme.The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. This solution involves the payment of enhanced subventions on quite a significant scale.It is the Department's intention to remain in contact with all health boards throughout the year on this and other issues.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	515	With regard to people with physical and sensory disabilities, there is currently no reliable statistical information available for the planning and  provision of health and personal social services for people in that sector. The establishment of the national physical and sensory disability database will enable a planned and pro-active approach to be taken in the delivery of health related services to people with physical or sensory disabilities.In terms of the inclusion of people who are over 65 on the database, it should be pointed out that as people become older, they become more susceptible to physical or sensory disability of some nature or other. The impact of the inclusion of people over the age of 65 would be significant at this stage in terms of data collection and the update of the database. However, it is envisaged that there will be sharing of information between the various sections of the health boards concerning the planning and provision of services to these care groups.The national physical and sensory disability database Committee will review the criteria for inclusion on the database on an ongoing basis, and I am confident that once the database has initially been rolled out, there will be further discussion regarding the inclusion of people who are over 65. These discussions will reflect the need for services to be delivered to people with physical or sensory disabilities in a seamless and appropriate manner.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The latest figures available for cases of sexually transmitted infections are those for 2000. In that  year 8,869 cases were notified to the National Disease Surveillance Centre, an increase of 27% over 1999. Clearly this rate of increase is a source of concern.Since 1992 additional funding has been provided each year to health boards to address the problems of HIV-AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place. There are currently six consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV-AIDS and STIs in Ireland – five of these are in Dublin, one of whom deals with children, and one in Cork. With increasing numbers of people presenting with a range of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, I have provided funding this year in respect of the appointment of a new infectious diseases consultant in the Western Health Board.STI clinics are available in the following locations: St. James's Hospital, the Mater Hospital, Baggot Street Clinic, the Aisling Clinic, Cherry Orchard Hospital, City Clinic, Amiens Street, Ennis General Hospital, the Victoria Hospital in Cork, Limerick Regional Hospital, University College Hospital, Galway, Sligo Regional Hospital, Nenagh Regional Hospital, and Waterford Regional Hospital. Facilities are also being developed at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.The care and management sub-committee of the national AIDS strategy committee is currently reviewing services that are available throughout the country with a view to identifying gaps and making recommendations for the future direction of treatment services.The promotion of sexual health and safer sexual practices amongst the population is crucial to tackling the increase in STIs, and has been identified as a strategic objective within the national health promotion strategy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	520	As the Deputy is aware, the Ombudsman, in his report on the nursing home subvention scheme, asserted that, under the 1970 Health Act, any person in need of nursing home care has a statutory entitlement to the provision of this service by a health board.As my Department advised the Ombudsman in its response to the draft report of the Ombudsman, its view is that the Health Act, 1970, as amended, distinguishes between eligibility for a service and entitlement to a service, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. This view is supported by legal advice available to my Department.What is clear is that the uncertainty that undoubtedly exists in relation to eligibility and entitlement should be resolved. The new health strategy acknowledges this and sets down a commitment to introduce legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement.In the interim, applicants who qualify for a subvention following an assessment of need and means in accordance with the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations, 1993, will continue to receive their entitlement to a subvention. In this regard, as the Deputy will be aware, funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. In 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million –€35.30 million. Some £52 million –€66.03 million was made available for 2001 while in 2002, the funding for the scheme has again been substantially increased, amounting to £72 million-€91million.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	521	It is unclear from the Deputy's question, what payments he is referring to. Nonetheless, I presume he is referring to the assessment of applicant's means which allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing these means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid (Article 8.2 of the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations, 1993).Article 10.3 provides that a person whose sole means as assessed by the health board is a sum equivalent to or lower than the weekly rate payable at the time of the old age non-contributory pension shall qualify for the maximum amount of subvention per week. Based on this regulation, the level of subvention granted to an applicant whose only income is the OANCP would not be affected by the application of Article 8.2. Therefore, as there was no reduction in subvention due, there are no arrears due. Thus, it may appear that OANCP recipients are treated differently than applicants in receipt of other pensions.As I have outlined, I am only presuming to know what the Deputy means. If he wishes to provide further clarification, including details of a particular case if appropriate, I will have further enquiries made.

The regulations empower local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association, to grant disabled person's parking permits to a disabled person who is suffering from a disability that prevents that person from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking.This area previously came under the remit of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and in 1998 his Department agreed to make once-off payments of £5,000 to the Disabled Drivers Association and the Irish Wheelchair Association towards the set-up costs for the issue of the new permits.

A re-test which does not require the use of a test lane will be conducted free of charge within this period. Outside of this, a full test must be carried out and the standard test fee is chargeable.

Existing regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.The Minister for the Environment and Local Government previously held responsibility in this area and following representations from hackney, limousine and motorcycle interests on the issue of bus lane access, a review of the regulations was undertaken last year by his Department in consultation with An Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and Dublin Corporation.An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access. Having regard to these circumstances, and having considered the various views expressed on this issue, it was decided on completion of the review that there should be no change in the existing bus lane access provisions.I have no proposals at present to amend the existing provisions.

Iarnród Éireann plan to commission shortly a more detailed study to develop this proposal.The DTO advise that the Phoenix Park tunnel is very limited in capacity and does not offer the development potential when compared to the proposed interconnector and the needs of Dublin in the period up to and beyond 2016. In the short-term due to track capacity constraints in Connolly Station, it would not be possible to route additional services via the tunnel without restricting existing services.

This plan will provide for the availability of treatment and rehabilitation for all who need them and the introduction of compulsory drug testing for prisoners where necessary.The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 endorsed the approach already in place in the Prisons Service to tackle the problem of drug abuse in the prison system. An action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system was approved in 1999. This advocated a broad-based approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. The 1999 action plan, which built on an agreed policy between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the then Eastern Health Board, advocated the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug-free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. It is my intention to continue with the implementation of the action plan and to step up the current pace of work to tackle the scourge of drugs in prison in line with the undertaking referred to above in the new programme for Government.The national steering group, established in 1999 to implement the action plan continues to meet under the chairmanship of the Director General of the Prisons Service. It is pursuing a multi-disciplinary approach to the drugs problem with substantial input from the health sector, especially the Eastern Regional Health Authority.

A five member consultation team was appointed in April and will meet with interested parties including the disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, ICTU, IBEC, the Fourth Pillar and relevant Departments over the coming months.The DLCG is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers, which has been brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, at the request of the then Minister of State to facilitate meaningful dialogue at national level, both within the sector and with the consultation team.It is my intention and that of my colleague Minister of State, Deputy Willie O'Dea, in accordance with the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government, to complete the consultation process and bring an amended Bill through the Oireachtas as soon as practicable thereafter.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 and 247 together.I assume that the Deputy is referring to claims of discrimination made under the Equal Status Act, 2000. Complaints of discrimination, are considered, in the first instance, by the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. I should point out that the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations is an independent statutory office set up under the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and that the director and her equality officers are independent in the performance of their functions. Under Section 22 of the Equal Status Act, 2000 the director may dismiss a claim at any stage in the investigation if she is of the opinion that the claim has been made in bad faith or is frivolous or vexatious or relates to a trivial matter. Once a case has been determined by the director, the complainant or respondent involved may appeal against the decision to the Circuit Court. I am aware of complaints from some interests that the Equal Status Act, 2000 is being abused. It is open to any complainant or respondent aggrieved by a particular decision to appeal.Regarding the Deputy's proposal that compensation be paid to voluntary groups or communities representing the individual pursuing a case under the Act rather than to the individual themselves, I would not favour paying compensation to a third party, rather than to the victim. The Deputy's proposal may not be consistent with our obligations under Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. That directive requires member states to lay down sanctions applicable to infringements and states that sanctions, which may comprise the payment of compensation to the victim, must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.The types of redress that may be provided under the Act are either or both: (a) an order for compensation for the effects of discrimination, or (b) an order that a person or persons specified in the order take a course of actions which is so specified.

Dealing number D2000XS011876N refers. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications for first registration and section 49 applications, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process.I am further informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitors on 14 June 2002 and the application cannot proceed until these queries have been satisfactorily resolved. However, I can assure the Deputy that, on receipt of a satisfactory reply, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	545	The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 contains a number of provisions which have not yet been brought into force, including section 24 which provides for the amendment of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 to create a new offence of criminal trespass. I propose to make a general commencement order shortly bringing virtually all of the provisions of the Act into force, including section 24.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	546	This scheme was not included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Kildare County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004, announced last April. Given the position regarding the prioritisation of the scheme by the council, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.

The local authority was requested, in December 2001, to forward further information or documentation to enable its request to be considered. This information is still awaited.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	548	It is estimated that in the region of 45,000 existing local authority rented dwellings lack a central heating system. Since 1994, my Department has required that central heating be provided during construction in new local authority dwellings and included in the overall cost of the schemes.With regard to older existing local authority rented dwellings the management, maintenance and improvement of such dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. However, where capital funding is being provided under my Department's remedial works or area regeneration schemes the provision of central heating may form part of the work being funded.Local authorities may also seek on a case by case basis, approval to the use of internal capital receipts, which are in excess of the requirements of their programmes for the provision of local authority houses and the remedial works scheme, for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings.Apart from that, there is no specific mechanism available from my Department to fund the installation of central heating in local authority dwellings.

Broadly speaking, no significant additional costs are envisaged over and above those already arising from the obligations on Departments in relation to the adoption by the Government in July 2000 of official languages equality as one of the three new principles for quality customer services, to provide a quality service through Irish and/or bi-lingually and inform customers of their right to choose to be dealt with through one or other of the official languages.However, additional costs will probably arise in connection with matters such as the establishment of the Office of the Official Languages Commissioner; training, bilingual and translation services. Costs for individual Departments or State bodies, or indeed on an overall basis, cannot be established until individual schemes have been agreed.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	558	Widows and widowers who do not qualify for the widow-widower's contributory pension, subject to the means test, qualify for one-parent family payment if they have dependent children, or for widow-widowers non-contributory pension if they do not have dependent children. The maximum rates of payment under both schemes are €118.80 per week for those aged under 66 and €134 per week for those aged over 66. The increase in respect of a qualified child, where payable is €19.30 per week.Under the means test associated with the one-parent family payment, a recipient is entitled to earn up to €146.50 without affecting his or her payment. Earnings between €146.50 per week and €293 per week are assessed at 50% and the rate of one-parent family payment paid is reduced accordingly. Payment ceases when earnings exceed €293 per week. However, there are transitional arrangements in place whereby a recipient of the one-parent family payment who exceeds the upper income limit may retain 50% of his or her entitlement for a further 12 months.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	559	The farm assist scheme is a means tested scheme to provide ongoing income support for farmers on low income. In calculating means for the purposes of farm assist, account is taken of the gross yearly income which the farmer and his or her spouse-partner may reasonably expect to receive less any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying on the business. In addition, where the farmer has dependent children, €253.95 per annum is disregarded in respect of each of the first two qualified children and €380.92 each per annum for subsequent children. Some 70% of the remaining net income is then assessed.The assessment of the expected annual income is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity and market trends. While the income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the position, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances such as exceptionally adverse weather conditions, so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.
