#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call on Deputies in the order in which they were submitted.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to debate an issue of national importance, namely, the urgent need to support Donnycarney Youth Project's position paper, through which its local voluntary committee manages the youth project, the drugs project and the community employment scheme.  The youth project aims to respond to the local needs of young people and those affected by drug use.  I also ask the Dáil to support the recent document on health.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to debate an issue of national importance, namely, suicide prevention.  Since the economic collapse, there has been a considerable rise in suicide across Ireland, specifically in my area of Dublin North West, which has been very hard hit, with two young people taking their lives in the Finglas area in the past two weeks alone.  There have been several other deaths of young people from suicide in my area in recent years.  There is no doubt that the desperation of the recession is a major contributory factor.  Something must be done to tackle this problem, in the provision of mental health services and health promotion education to create a better understanding of the issue among the general populace.  More people are dying from suicide than from road accidents.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Iarraim go gcuirfear an Dáil ar athló faoi Bhuan Ordú leis an gceist phráinneach seo a phlé, namely, the imminent injection of €19 billion of taxpayers' moneys into the covered institutions without any Dáil debate or scrutiny on the matter.  Given that €10 billion of this injection will be taken from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the remainder borrowed at very high interest rates, it is unacceptable that the transfer of these funds into the four banks will take place when the Dáil is not even sitting.  This injection of €19 billion will be used primarily to pay senior bondholders, many of whom are not covered by the banking guarantee.  At least €4.3 billion will be paid to bondholders between now and the end of September, a figure close to the €4 billion in public spending cuts and tax increases expected in December's budget.  This payment of €19 billion will be made without any Dáil scrutiny or debate.  Considering that the €19 billion is 39 times greater than the total cost of the so-called jobs initiative, which was debated in this House over three days, there is clear need for a debate in here on the €19 billion injection into the four banks, which is due to take place in the next ten days.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	7	As there are ten proposals to be put to the House today, I will therefore need the assistance of Members.  Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. today agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12 to 17, inclusive, agreed to?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	8	It is not agreed.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	9	That proposal is not agreed.  I call Deputy O'Brien on behalf of Sinn Féin.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The passenger name record agreement is due to be taken without debate and we disagree with that.  The previous agreement which came before the House was between Ireland and the EU and it was the subject of a lengthy debate in this Chamber.  We disagree with this agreement being taken without debate.  It has far-reaching consequences for every citizen in this State and time should be allocated today to discuss it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I call Deputy Higgins on behalf of the Socialist Party.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I am opposed to the taking of Nos. 13 and 14 without debate.  I am very opposed to the taking, without debate, of No. 17, which relates to the free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea.  I worked on this agreement when I was on the international trade committee of the European Parliament and there are several aspects of it that are utterly reprehensible.  It forces widespread deregulation and liberalisation of Korean services with downward pressure on workers' wages and conditions.  My second and final major point of objection as to why it should be debated here is that, with breathtaking hypocrisy, the European Union, which prides itself as being a paragon of environmental standards, has insisted in this trade agreement on Korea's stricter environmental law on motor car emissions being waived to allow bigger and more polluting European cars to be sold on the Korean market.  It is an expression of an extreme neoliberal and right wing economic agenda.  It has major implications for Korean workers in particular but also for some European workers and should be debated in the full Dáil before it is voted on.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	13	All these proposals have been debated and considered in the respective committees.  That is why we set up a committee system.  That is why Members have plenty of opportunity to discuss these issues at committees.  These are reports back from committees where these issues have already been discussed.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 17a, motion re changes in Standing Orders, agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22, Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011, agreed to?
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It is not agreed.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	17	This is very expensive legislation.  There are 30 amendments to it due for discussion today.  It deals with more than 40 Acts ranging from the Official Languages Act to the citizenship legislation, the Civil Legal Aid Act, family law legislation and the Equal Status Acts and the time being allocated to deal with the Report Stage of this Bill is not sufficient considering the number of amendments tabled to it and that the debate on it will be guillotined at 2 p.m.  I remind the Tánaiste that this Bill will probably not be opposed given that it was not opposed on Committee Stage, but we ask that sufficient time be provided to consider all 30 amendments to it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	18	This Bill provides for a number of reforms in civil law.  There is time allocated for this today up to 2 p.m. and I believe that is a sufficient amount of time to deal with it.  The Government is anxious that the Bill be dealt with and passed by the House today.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Before proceeding I warmly welcome seven African heads of mission to Ireland who are present in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery.

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	21	It is not agreed.  There are a number of proposals being made, several relating to the imposition of a guillotine.  Not so many months ago, if those who are now Government Whips had seen proposals for seven guillotines on a single day, they would have been apoplectic.  In many cases there is no need for the proposals to guillotine legislation because it will not be opposed and will pass virtually on the nod.  The Bills have been exhaustively debated and are not contentious.  I am arguing against the imposition of seven guillotines today and ask that even at this late stage, the Chief Whip and Tánaiste consider removing the guillotines.  This would allow debate to take place in a proper fashion with every one of the proposals before us, many of which are quite detailed changes in our legislation and require more time for every Deputy to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I support those comments.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	23	All of these are pieces of reforming legislation and I would expect Members of the House to support them.  One of the proposals, for example, deals with amendments from the Seanad to the child care Bill.  I recall last week that Deputy Ó Caoláin specifically asked for those amendments to be made, and they were made in the Seanad.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We are not opposing the amendments.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The House will today agree the amendments made in the Seanad which were proposed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It would be somewhat strange for the House to want to delay the implementation of those amendments and important child care legislation.

There are also a number of technical amendments relating to the birds directive.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	30	There are other issues too, such as planning matters.

I see no reason for the Opposition, or parts of it, to want to delay the reforms being dealt with.

The Tánaiste definitely did not listen and misrepresented exactly what I stated.  I indicated that most of the legislation was not contentious and would probably go through on the nod because there is agreement across the board on it.  I ask that the guillotines be lifted.  We have shown in recent months that when guillotines were imposed, they were not required.  Where legislation is welcome and not controversial, we have accepted the reasoning——

We have agreed with Ministers in putting legislation on the agenda today to facilitate debate.  All I ask is that the guillotines be lifted as the legislation will be passed in the timeframe outlined by the Government.  There should be ample opportunity to debate the different amendments to these pieces of legislation, which are far-reaching in some cases.  We do not want it said, in a number of months, that proper scrutiny was not given to the issue and legislation could be struck down by the Supreme Court.

The times we have set down to conclude the debate on each of the pieces of legislation is to provide a form of discipline for the House to ensure we get through all of them.

I am not going to add to this fable today.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Hear, hear.

That can involve doing research, working in our constituencies or reading important documents that inform the work we have to do.  I recognise that those in government will use the break to do much of the work that needs to be done in their Departments.  I am sure they will take this opportunity to do work that will be of great importance to the country in the autumn.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	70	That is very presidential.

The work we do in this House is a small part of the overall work we do.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Hear, hear.

Politics can demand dedication from people other than politicians — it is also required from the family members of Deputies, for example.  Politicians are often away from home for days or weeks on end.  I accept that the hours are long for Dublin Deputies, but it is fair to recognise that when the House is sitting, rural Deputies are away from home for the best part of the week.

I emphasise that regardless of their policies or allegiances, most politicians work very hard and believe in what they are doing.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Thank you, Deputy.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	85	——is for contributions to be made only by Deputies who disagree with the proposal before the House.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I am sure Deputy Ó Cuív will include you, a Cheann Comhairle.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	87	He will give the Ceann Comhairle a mention at the end.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I appreciate what Deputy Ó Cuív is saying, but I have given him sufficient time to say it.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Robotic.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Hear, hear.

Between now and the recall of the Dáil, those of us on this side of the House will continue to work and prepare to come back here as a vigilant and active Opposition.  Despite our depleted numbers, we will hold the Government to account.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Thank you.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Has the Deputy been to one of our Ard-Fheiseanna?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	105	As we pack up our buckets and spades and head off——

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	109	——it is useful to record that while politicians may work hard——

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	111	——many outside these walls work much harder.  It is only fitting to record the fact that hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers will have a very fretful summer on foot of a High Court decision and the failure of the Government to introduce emergency legislation.  We do not accept that the House should be adjourned, given that the Taoiseach is today attending an EU summit of immense importance to the State.

It promised to resolve the issue of the interest rate and deal with senior bondholders.  We have heard a great deal of rhetoric but seen very little action.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Deputy Kenny is the hardest working Taoiseach we have ever seen.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Reports in the media today suggest something may be brewing in the discussions between France and Germany.  It would be unacceptable if the Taoiseach were to fail to present himself before the House to give us a full account of the summit and reassure Deputies and the people as a whole — the taxpayers and citizens of the State — that he has finally taken a stand, done the right thing and represented the interests of citizens fully and fairly.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	116	He will do so.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	120	——with a level of cynicism and grandstanding that only the Labour Party and Fine Gael could muster.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	128	We heard the Minister of State the first time.  He only needed to say it once.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Deputy Higgins's holidays are booked.  He will be in trouble if we sit longer.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Deputy Higgins should be allowed to make his contribution.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The Government Whip should be giving his back benchers good example.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	135	The serious point is that more time is needed on this occasion.  I do not deny that many Members are tired and exhausted.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The Deputy should speak for himself.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	137	If one wants proof of this, one can look at the faces of the people from the media present.  They cannot wait to get out of here.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	138	The Deputy is blaming them again.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The same can be said of some Members.  It has been a difficult year.  However, more time is needed for three strong reasons.  First, the EU summit will probably decide to continue the policy of the leaders of the European establishment, which is to continue to force working-class people in this country and elsewhere in Europe to salvage a rotten financial system.  The Taoiseach should report back to us and give us an opportunity to discuss the outcome of the summit.  Second, approximately 250,000 low-paid workers, among the most vulnerable workers in our society, have been left without the protection of the joint labour committees and the employment regulation order system which the bosses had struck down in the Supreme Court.  This is the busiest and most pressurised time of the year in the hotel and restaurant sectors and other areas.  Tens of thousands in these sectors are open to pressure and exploitation.  It is shameful for the national Parliament to adjourn for the summer without giving these workers the protections they need.  Third, an opinion poll published this morning suggests 55% of the people are dissatisfied with the Government.  Significantly, a majority of Labour Party supporters are dissatisfied.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Is it any wonder, considering that we have had four months of putting the burden of salvaging the European financial system on the backs of ordinary working people?
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	142	What level of support did the Socialist Party receive in the poll?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	144	We need more time to deal with these issues.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Everybody deserves a break.  Whatever differences I have with the Members on the other side of the House, I recognise it has been a fairly intense few months in here and all of us have a difficult situation to deal with.  I do not doubt that Members have been working hard in their own way by their own lights in order to attempt to deal with the situation.Also, it is important to dispel the myth that politicians will all be swanning off for the next six or eight weeks on holidays.  They deserve a break and no doubt will take one, but many of them will be working for most of that time, either in their constituencies or on the issues that affect the country.That being said, however, there is a strong and legitimate case for keeping the Dáil convened for a few more days.  First, the issue of the European summit is a serious matter.  While there are some positive noises about what may happen there in terms of trying to deal with the debt crisis, there have been similar sounds before previous summits which turned out to be quite other than what people hoped and the contagion spread.  People are anxious and deserve to hear a full report and to have this House interrogate fully the outcome of that summit.In particular, one element of the Taoiseach's speech yesterday in terms of what might come out of that summit alarmed me greatly and if any such arrangement is put in place, it is certainly something that we need to discuss.  It is that if there was any talk of lengthening the maturities on loans and lowering interest rates, it may include a collateral arrangement where appropriate.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	150	We do not discuss the full issues.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I just want to make a point.  That is a very serious question.  That means assets of the State would be used as collateral against changes in interest rates.  That is a serious business and we need to know if that is the case.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Deputy Boyd Barrett is not correct.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Another reason is the issue of the JLCs and the uncertainty that faces those low-paid workers.Another reason is the Dáil owes it to a vulnerable section of society to clarify whether it will have the educational supports it needs come September.  Heading into the summer, parents of children with special needs who have been refused applications for special needs assistants need to know whether they will have them in the autumn.  There are 400 or so held over, but it is uncertain for many parents whether they will have them.  The Dáil has an obligation to the parents of the most vulnerable children in this country to clarify that situation before the summer break.Lastly, I have asked since the publication of the McCarthy report for some discussion in this House about what State assets may be on the chopping block for sale in order to pay off the bankers and bondholders and I have been referred constantly to the Chief Whip.  We have asked the Chief Whip in meeting after meeting to have this discussion and the Government consistently refuses to discuss the question of billions of euro in State assets that may be up for sale.  We should not adjourn the Dáil until that matter is discussed and clarified and the public gets a chance to know what may be up for sale to pay off bondholders.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	154	We should acknowledge that the House, since the general election, has sat for 38% longer than was previously the case.  The recess that is being proposed for this summer is the shortest that I certainly can recall, and I am in the House 22 years.  The date originally proposed by the previous Government for the adjournment of the Dáil for the summer was 7 July and the date for resumption was 29 September.  What we are talking about is a much shorter recess.A number of Members have referred to the important meeting taking place today in Brussels of the Heads of State and Government.  It is an important meeting that has been convened by President Van Rompuy.  First, the fact that the meeting is taking place represents a significant achievement for this country and for the Government.  For some time we have been seeking to have the debate about the debt crisis moved from being dealt with on a country-by-country basis to being dealt with on a European-wide basis, seeking a European solution to a European problem.  The fact that we are at a point today where there is a summit meeting taking place which is addressing a European solution to that crisis represents a very significant achievement for the country, for the Government and for the diplomatic work that we have been doing over the course of the past four months or more in that area.Second, I am sure everybody in the House will wish the Taoiseach well in the discussions taking place in Brussels today——

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	156	——and express the hope that there will be a positive outcome for Ireland from that meeting.  I certainly hope that there will be such a positive outcome and if there is, I hope it will be welcomed, not only by those of us who are on the Government side of the House but right across the House.  Much work has gone in over a long period of time to reach the point where today, hopefully, this country will get a positive outcome from the meeting that is taking place in Brussels.I am proposing that the House itself, in terms of its formal plenary session, will adjourn today and reconvene on 14 September.  However, it is appropriate that the outcome of the summit meeting today is considered by the parliamentary system.  I understand it is proposed that there will be a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on Tuesday at 4 o'clock to discuss the outcome of the summit.  As the House will be aware, every Member of the House is entitled to attend meetings of committees.  If it is the case that the number of Members interested in attending that committee is more than what would be accommodated in the committee room, we can have that meeting of the committee here in the Chamber so that any Member of the House who wants to discuss the outcome of today's summit, from which, hopefully, there will be satisfactory conclusions, can do so here in the House.  We can use the Chamber for the meeting of that committee and Members can be here in the Chamber at 4 o'clock on Tuesday next.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Yesterday, the Taoiseach and the House set out in the clearest and most strenuous language that the abuse and sheltering of abusers which has come to light in respect of the Roman Catholic Church will not be tolerated and that any undue interference by the Vatican would not only be viewed negatively, but would have negative consequences for the relationship between this State and that one.  I acknowledge fully the sincerity of Ministers Shatter and Fitzgerald in respect of the State's obligation to protect fully our children.  We demand of the church or any other private institution that they respect the laws of the land.  We have to be very sure that the laws of the land are robust and are implemented.  In that respect, when we come back in the autumn, I ask that the child welfare and protection agency Bill, the children first Bill and the national vetting bureau Bill have realistic timetables, and that, having castigated the church, we do not have a situation in which the State fails our children.

The Government has responded very quickly to the Cloyne report and its implications.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minster for Justice and Equality have set out the legislative measures the Government will take, and they will be progressed.  The Taoiseach yesterday set out very clearly the Government's reaction to the interventions by the Vatican.  As the Deputy is aware, I have sought a formal response in respect of that from the Vatican.With regard to the legislation, the children first Bill is being worked on as a priority and we expect the heads of that Bill will be before the Government shortly.

It is intended that the three referenda will be held on the same date as the presidential election and this will mean that the legislative provisions for those referenda will be before the House when we come back.  The Taoiseach has given an undertaking to party leaders that when texts are settled, there will be consultation after that.

If it is a later date, so be it, but there is a finite date by which the presidential election must be held because the seven years will be up.Is it possible to get a detailed timetable of what is proposed in terms of the date for the legislation, getting it through both Houses, how much debate we will have and the details of the setting up of the commission?

First, we do not yet have an outcome.  As other Members have said, some summit meetings can be entirely predictable and the issues concern the conclusions that are reached, their form or whether further work must be done later.  We cannot predict the outcome of that meeting other than to say we very much hope there will be a positive outcome from that summit meeting today.  That has been the way in which the Government has prepared for it.This is really a matter for the committee.  I do not know who the committee has invited and that is a matter for it.  Obviously, the Government will decide who will make a presentation to the committee, and that will to some extent depend on the outcome of the summit.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Fine Gael-Labour Government has committed in our programme for Government to radical reform of our entire political system.  Dáil and Oireachtas reform is one aspect of what is long-overdue reform of our political system.I am pleased to recommend to the House a package of reform measures which represents the first phase of the Government's Dáil reform programme.  Dáil reform is the shared responsibility of every Member of this House.  In the just over four months since the change of Government, the deputy Government Whip, Deputy Emmet Stagg, and I, as Chief Whip, have had a number of meetings with the three Opposition Whips to progress the Dáil reform agenda.  These meetings have been very productive because the Whips from all the parties have engaged in the process in a very open-minded, positive and constructive way.The Government has now brought forward a set of reforms that includes commitments outlined in the programme for Government, issues raised by the Opposition Whips and administrative changes designed to improve the efficiency of the Dáil.  These reforms have been discussed at the Dáil reform committee and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and are now before the House for approval of Members.This is the first phase of a programme of Dáil reform designed to be implemented over the lifetime of this Government.  Work will commence in the autumn on the second phase of the reform which will consider further recommendations made by the Ceann Comhairle and members of the Opposition as well as commitments in the programme for Government that remain outstanding.The impact of the reforms contained in today's proposals will have a transformative effect on this Dáil.  Members on 14 September, following a shortened summer recess, will return to a different Dáil, with new rules and improved procedures.  They will return to a Dáil where Members can play a more active and meaningful role in the legislative process and where Members will have more opportunity to raise issues with Ministers in a more effective manner.  They will return to a Dáil better equipped to hold the Executive to account, a Dáil that has started to turn back the tide and to recover some of the power it has been losing to the Executive for over a decade.  The most important improvements proposed in this first phase of Dáil reform include a topical issue debate.  A new system of topical issue debates will be introduced to allow Members to raise topical issues with a Minister for the relevant Department in the Dáil Chamber in the middle of the sitting day.  The new topical issue debates will replace the current Adjournment debates.  The Adjournment debate system is seen as an afterthought to Dáil business rather than one of the primary ways in which Deputies, including Government Deputies, can hold the Government to account.  The Adjournment debates scheduled at the end of the sitting day are often overlooked and forgotten.  In recent years, the practice of a junior Minister reading scripts on behalf of a number of Departments about a range of issues unrelated to his or her Department has developed.  In opposition Labour and Fine Gael criticised the format of the Adjournment Debate especially when Ministers who had no connection with the Department responded to the debate.  We made a commitment in the programme for Government to reform this system and now we will.Time will be allocated for 12 topical issue debates during the full sitting week and these debates will be held in the middle of the Dáil sitting day and not the last thing before the Dáil adjourns for the day.  On Tuesdays, four topical issue debates will start at 5:06 p.m.; on Wednesdays, four topical issue debates will start at 3.45 p.m.; and on Thursdays four topical issue debates will start at 3.42 p.m.  Each item selected for the topical issue debate will be given an allocation of 12 minutes.  The proposer will introduce the debate for four minutes; the Minister or Minister of State will have four minutes to reply; the proposer will have two minutes for a supplementary question; and the Minister or Minister of State will have two minutes for a concluding statement.The Minister or Minister of State for the relevant Department will, except in exceptional circumstances, be the one to respond to the debate on behalf of the Government.  The new system of topical issue debates will give Deputies in the Dáil the opportunity to raise current issues with a Minister from the relevant Department early in the Dáil sitting day.  This is a vast improvement on the existing system and I believe it will be welcomed by Deputies across the House.Leaders Questions will be taken by the Tánaiste on Thursdays with 21 minutes allocated on Thursday at 10.30 a.m. before the Order of Business to allow the Opposition parties raise issues in a Leader's Questions format.  These questions will be taken, except in exceptional circumstances, by the Tánaiste.  Leader's Questions are the most high profile and effective method by which Opposition parties hold the Government to account.  They are the main focus of media attention on any sitting day, even being televised live on RTE One on Wednesdays.  By increasing the weekly allocation of Leader's Questions by 50% the Government is voluntarily providing the Opposition parties an opportunity to hold the Government to account in the Dáil Chamber.There will be Friday sittings for Deputies to introduce their own legislation.  This change will enhance the legislative role of Deputies.  Under the current system the Executive has almost a monopoly on the formation of legislation in the Dáil.  Opposition Deputies can only use Opposition Private Members' time to introduce a Bill and Government Deputies have no such outlet.  The new system will allow Deputies an opportunity to be part of the law-making process by giving them an opportunity to write and publish their own Bills and then submit those Bills to be debated in the Dáil.  The Dáil will sit on the first Friday of every month and this sitting will be dedicated to providing time to allow Deputies introduce their own Bills.

I thank the Opposition Whips for their help in this also.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important matter.  Political reform and reform of the Dáil was a very important issue on the doorsteps during the general election campaign.  The programme for Government commits to radical reform of our political system of which Dáil and Oireachtas reform is a critical component.  Reform of how we conduct our business in this Chamber has been long spoken about, but we have not seen any changes taking place.  I congratulate the Government Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on hitting the ground running, on taking this crucial issue on board and on introducing these reforms today.  He is to be commended on bringing these about in the first session of the 31st Dáil.I also commend the approach of all the Whips, including the Opposition Whips in this process.  I was privileged to be a Member of the last Dáil and our views on Dáil reform were not taken on board.  It is a welcome change.  It is also important to recognise that this is a first phase of a package of Dáil reform.  The work of the Dáil reform elements will come in during the lifetime of the Government.I wish to focus on one element.  The topical issue debate will replace the Adjournment Debate and will be taken in the middle of the sitting day.  It is a welcome step that will allow such issues to become alive in the Chamber.  The Minister or Minister of State will be required to answer a supplementary question and will make it more meaningful.  I welcome the introduction of these reforms and look forward to coming back after the break and seeing them in practice.
#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I welcome the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the Labour Party section of the coalition on the motion to change Standing Orders.  The changes, which are proposed to take effect from 14 September, are the first step of the Government's plan for the radical reform of our entire political system.  Both Labour and Fine Gael gave a commitment in our election manifestos to reform how business is done in this House to make it more efficient, effective and accountable.  These reforms were endorsed by the electorate and are reflected in our programme for Government.  We have been given a democratic mandate to implement these commitments and we are delivering on them.These changes also reflect the contributions of the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who have contributed much to these changes.  This set of proposals also reflects input from the Opposition Whips.  Based on my recent experience as Labour Party assistant Whip and being a member of the CPP, there seems to be a very positive relationship between both sides of the House and I commend everybody on their efforts and on voicing their opinions.  I would like to think those opinions have been listened to.I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for his detailed contribution on these changes.  His experience and advice have been invaluable in the formation of these measures.  I know I speak for Deputy Stagg in saying that we look forward to giving further consideration to more of his proposals in the autumn.There is a long history of work done on these issues with no outcome, but this time it is different.  This time we have real positive proposals for change in how we do business in this House.  With these proposals we are undertaking to make better use of the time available to us in this House to legislate and to hold the Executive to account.While some of these points have been made already, it is important to point out the changes that will be implemented in September.  The Dáil will commence earlier on Tuesdays at 2 p.m.  Topical issue debates will replace the current Adjournment Debate.  The Standing Order 32 procedures for raising urgent issues will be reformed.  A time limit will be introduced for the Order of Business.  We will provide for Leaders Questions to be taken by the Tánaiste on Thursdays.  A new procedure will allow Dáil Deputies raise issues regarding replies to parliamentary questions.  There will be changes to Taoiseach's Questions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  There will be extra Dáil sitting days on the first Friday of every month to provide time for Deputies to introduce their own Bills.It is important to note the origin of these proposals.  These commitments were given in the respective manifestos of Labour and Fine Gael.  These proposals came from parties which had spent 14 years in opposition and witnessed 14 years of inaction on Dáil reform.  This experience of opposition means that the changes are in the interest of those now in opposition.  There is therefore a large measure of agreement on these measures because of the origins of the proposals.We know the Dáil must be able to hold the Executive to account, and this first step and the steps to follow will greatly strengthen the hand of Dáil Éireann in that regard.Two of the measures of this reform agenda are crucial to how we function as a Parliament.  The first relates to the primacy of power being held by elected public representatives.  In recent years, power has been taken from the House and transferred to nameless persons holding positions in unaccountable bodies.  This was a policy instrument to abdicate Government responsibility and weakened our parliamentary democracy and the power of the people.In autumn, the Government Whips will start work on the next phase of Dáil reform in consultation with the Opposition Whips.  The next step in the programme for reform will concern returning more power to the Dáil.  In this we will propose to return to Deputies the right to raise parliamentary questions on the activity of the bodies to which I referred.  Since these bodies deal with the people's money, the people are entitled to ask questions about how it is spent.  This is an undertaking in the programme for Government and will mean that Members will be able to ask questions of and get replies from Ministers who have quangos under their remit.  My colleague and deputy Government Whip, Deputy Stagg, recently told the House that "real power in democracy is the power to ask a question and get an answer".  I agree with him that this feature has been removed in recent years by the reduction in the Chamber's power.  We propose to return that power.We also propose reforms relating to the standard of information to be provided in response to parliamentary questions.  Procedures will be introduced for Deputies who have issues with the details of replies to their parliamentary questions.  These issues will be referred to the Ceann Comhairle to decide if reasonable information has been provided.  The Ceann Comhairle can refer a matter back to the Minister with a request for further information.  If the reply from the Minister is still unsatisfactory in the view of the Deputy who originally asked the question, he or she can request that the Ceann Comhairle schedule the issue as a topical issue debate.  This fair appeals procedure will increase the power of Deputies to access information and fulfil their roles as elected representatives.There will be Friday sittings for Deputies to introduce their own legislation.  This is probably the most important element of Dáil reform as it constitutes the creation of a new parliamentary space for non-officeholders to legislate.  From September, the Dáil will sit on the first Friday of every month.  This sitting will be designed to provide time to consider Second Stage of Bills introduced by Members.  Any Deputy who is not a holder of ministerial office and who has published a Bill can submit it to be debated in the Chamber on one of these Friday sittings.  Bills submitted will be selected by a lottery system a minimum of two weeks before the sitting day on which the Bill is to be debated to allow the proposing Deputy and the Department concerned to prepare.  No vote will be held during these Friday sittings.  Rather, they will be held on the next sitting day after the Order of Business.This Friday time will be much in demand and there exists the possibility to introduce approximately eight to ten new Bills each year.  It will give significant additional powers to Opposition parties and increase involvement by non-officeholders through contributing legislation.This is the first step in a programme of reform to be implemented over the lifetime of the Government.  The introduction of a Dáil reform package just four months into the Government's life shows a genuine commitment to deliver on reform.  We are delivering on our commitments outlined in the programme for Government to sit longer and do more.  With this and other measures, we will bring greater effectiveness and accountability to how we do business.  After more than a decade of inaction, the issue of Dáil reform is not only back on the agenda, real progress is at last being made on the issue.

There has been positive engagement between us all and a collegial approach to the reform agenda.  My party is unhappy with some of the elements contained in this package, but we will not oppose it, as we see merit in a number of its proposals.  We are fully committed to the process embarked upon by the Chief Whip and the incremental approach being taken.  We will work with him on phases two and three.  We are also struck by the fact that he has given firm commitments to the effect that none of this is written in stone and that we are taking these proposals through a trial process.  We expect he will honour his commitment that, if we find particular problems with these arrangements while we are working them out, matters can be revisited.In the first weeks after the general election, all parties and groups expressed their absolute commitment to significant reform of the Dáil.  A consistent theme was the need to increase significantly the opportunities for Deputies to hold the Government to account for its actions and to loosen the tight control exercised by the Government on the House's substantive business.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly confirmed his intention to support radical reform.Regrettably, while the package before the House has merit, in no way does it deliver on the substantial reforms promised by the Government.  No single measure marks a radical departure in how we conduct business and a wide swathe of the promises contained in the past five years of Fine Gael and Labour policy documents are nowhere to be seen.  Most disturbingly, key elements of the package mark a retrograde step, not least in terms of the answerability of the Taoiseach to the House.  It is striking that the only significant change to our daily business is that of the topical issue debate, which I must welcome because it was included in the package of proposals initiated by Mr. John Curran, my predecessor as Fianna Fáil Whip.It is also regrettable that the Government has chosen to spend so much time making fundamentally false allegations about the issue of reform by claiming there have been no reforms in the past 14 years.  Deputy Lyons can be forgiven his allusion, as he was not a Member for the past 14 years, but other Members know that significant change was introduced by successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments.

This Fianna Fáil initiative was taken to make the Dáil more responsive to the issues of the day and to give the leaders of the Opposition parties recognition and a significant platform at the most important points in our daily schedule.  Nothing in today's proposals approaches the significance of this initiative.  My party introduced another major structural reform, that being the development of a major research facility in the Houses to aid Members and enable them to get expert assistance on all matters before the Oireachtas.Last week, the Tánaiste claimed that sitting past the first week of July was a major reform, but he chose to forget or not to mention that we have sat past the first week of July in each of the past three years.  When in Opposition, many members of the Government got into the habit of being hyper-political in everything.  This is understandable and it was reflected in their willingness to make promises they had no ability or intention to implement.  Hence, the level of disappointment with this initiative felt by many Members.The need for reform of the Dáil is clear.  Most of our business is decided for us on Tuesday mornings around the Cabinet table.  Members' contributions are generally brushed aside by Ministers.  This is true in terms of general policy debates, the consideration of legislation and even direct questions.  Important reforms were proposed last year and the only positive changes in today's package originate from the work of Mr. Curran and the last Dáil's Whips.  What has changed since then is that the demand for reform has increased and the need for it has become more urgent.The Government has an unprecedented majority and is clearly intent on using it to push aside controversial matters.  No Government in recent decades would have refused to acknowledge there was a serious problem with a Minister withholding vital information while guillotining a measure to restrict the work of a tribunal, which happened in recent weeks.  Equally, no Government has refused to provide even a single piece of background information when imposing a €1.8 billion charge on the public.  Attempts by the Opposition to seek reasonable information on matters before the Houses are routinely brushed aside by Ministers.  After many years in government, Fianna Fáil was accused of being arrogant, but Members on this side of the House can conclude that Ministers not long in office are quite arrogant in the way they deal with questions.

That is a positive initiative proposed by Fianna Fáil.  It is important such debates are managed constructively and that we do not deal with a host of parish pump issues in the middle of the working day.  Equally, it is important that we find a system under which Members who have concerns about legitimate constituency issues can raise them.  We do not want to see a situation develop such as that at Westminster where government backbenchers come in with scripts to laud the work of particular Ministers; we want to have a more positive and meaningful role.We also welcome the extended sitting times.  We are concerned, however, about the proposed Friday sittings, a positive initiative in so far as it will allow an opportunity to discuss Private Member's Bills, but we had looked forward to a more substantive session that would involve legislation and Ministers answering questions the way they would during a routine sitting day.  It is, therefore, something of a missed opportunity, although we recognise the importance of new initiatives such as Members having significant time to introduce Private Members' Bills.  As others have mentioned, at the last election the message on the doorsteps was that those of us returned were to focus on national issues.  This system gives us an opportunity to work on Private Members' Bill and legislation, an opportunity that was not provided previously.  I note, however, that the people who were advocating more work on national issues are still coming to constituency clinics and demanding that local issues be dealt with.The major weakness of the initiative concerns the accountability of the Taoiseach.  Looking at the Taoiseach's current approach to answering questions, the initiative provides him with an opportunity to participate even less in giving an account to the House.  He will spend half an hour less on questions, combined with the new aggressive approach by his office to transferring questions to other Ministers which has been the subject of heated debate on the Order of Business on a number of occasions.  This is completely contrary to the personal and party promise he made.  In his final press conference before the election he talked about reform and said the Taoiseach should spend more time answering questions.  He gave an unambiguous commitment to attend and answer questions on Thursdays.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government reiterated this commitment on 6 March when he said the Taoiseach was personally committed to answering questions on Thursdays.  When the proposal for establishing committees was published, the Government hailed its own reforming zeal in cutting numbers.  It did not, however, mention its intention to establish a raft of sub-committees which effectively carry out the work of the supposedly abolished committees.  What happened was then disguised as reform.  I am concerned about the lessening of the time the Taoiseach will attend the House, about the doing away with questions to the Taoiseach on Wednesdays and not honouring the commitment to come into the House on Thursdays.  We welcome that the fact that there will be Leaders' Questions, but we would prefer to see the Taoiseach dealing with them.

As a Member of the Oireachtas committee on Dáil reform for nine years, some of these ideas have been long sought and awaited.  It was not always possible to get agreement at that committee, sometimes for party political reasons.  The first Dáil reform committee from 2002 to 2007 was specifically held up because at the time the Labour Party and Fine Gael opposed any movement on Dáil reform unless the Taoiseach would make himself available in the Chamber on Thursdays to take Leaders' Questions.  How times have changed; in fact, the Labour Party released the Taoiseach from that duty in a deal to overtake the Technical Group.We can play politics with this issue, but that is not the point; the aim is to ensure the Dáil is as effective as possible and that Members' time is used as constructively as possible, allowing as many Members as possible to participate in debates and play a role in the parliament to which they have been elected.  Some of these changes will have that effect, but there also problems.  That is why I welcome the commitment given by the Chief Whip that this issue will be revisited in order that we can tinker with the mechanism, if required.  It is a shame we did not have a longer debate as a group prior to today's presentation.  That is the nature of this Dáil since it was elected; everything seems to be done in a rush.  A programme was set out that insisted this must be passed now in order that it can take effect in September, but another one or two meetings might have been needed to ensure the proposals would deliver what was needed.There are other issues that should be addressed in a Dáil reform package and which I will continue to push for inclusion in the next reform package.  I encourage all Deputies, particularly newly elected Deputies, to continue to submit ideas to the relevant Whip or the Ceann Comhairle in order that we can ensure all ideas are taken on board.When we contemplate major change along the lines of that presented, we must bear in mind the implications for industrial relations and workers in the Houses.  Because of the embargo, the staff of the Houses are working flat out and stretched to the limit and we are imposing additional sitting days on them.  That was included in the programme for Government and we do not oppose it, but there are problems if we continually stretch out the number of hours the ushers, porters and transcribers all must work.  We must recognise this issue and ask the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to deal with it, if need be by seeking an exemption from the embargo to ensure the Houses can work effectively.  It is not just Deputies who are needed to run this House, we need the support of the staff also.I have no problem with the change to an earlier sitting time of 2 p.m. on Tuesdays; I have argued that the House should sit at 10.30 a.m. and that the work proposed to be done on Fridays should be done on Tuesday mornings.  That would not require the attendance of a senior Cabinet Minister, taking the Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday mornings into account.  That would allow us, if required, to sit on a Friday.  It would also allow Deputies, especially rural-based ones, to continue the other work they must get on with on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  It is not the case that TDs do not work on Fridays.My major concern is that the time for the Taoiseach to attend the Chamber has been substantially reduced.  It is a reduction of nearly 25% of the time during which the Taoiseach is accountable to the Dáil, other than on the Order of Business.  Even though on Tuesdays the time for Taoiseach's Questions has been increased, there will be no such questions on Wednesdays.  The programme for Government stated the Taoiseach would be more accountable, so we need to address that matter.  This may only be a temporary measure, however, so we need to discover whether there will be a second round of Leaders' Questions which might solve the problem.I welcome the change to have topical issues discussed during the day, rather than having an evening Adjournment debate.  I am concerned, however, that it should not be dominated by key spokespersons.  It should not take away from the opportunities that currently exist for backbenchers to raise matters on the Adjournment.  They are often local issues, which are important nonetheless — not about potholes, but major issues that may arise locally.  There is no other mechanism to have such a debate with a Minister.  I welcome the changes which mean there will be more of a debate with Ministers, rather than the stale exchange that now passes for a debate on the Adjournment.  While the proposed changes are welcome, I sound that note of caution.I welcome the promise by the Government Chief Whip that a senior Minister will engage in the proposed topical issues debate.  Hopefully that will avoid having a Minister reading scripts back to a Deputy.  While that is absolutely pointless in some respects, one does need to have a debate sometimes.  I have attended Adjournment debates to raise points, but a Minister has then read out a script that has no relationship to what I asked.  The Minister may then apologise and say "This is what I have been given".  The proposal for a debate on topical issues is welcome, particularly as it will be in the middle of the day.  In addition, a senior Minister will be present who, hopefully, will be on top of the brief and thus able to engage with the questions posed.There are other proposals for 30 second issues and matters like that in future.  We should examine them because they might provide a mechanism that would compensate for the loss of matters raised under Standing Order 32.  Even though it may sometimes look like a waste of time, it is a vehicle that has been used quite effectively both by Government and Opposition backbenchers to raise issues of local or national importance.  In that way, a Deputy can put on the record the fact that he or she attempted to raise a matter in the House.  We should re-examine that proposal.I welcome the proposal concerning Private Members' Bills.  Anything that gives greater opportunities for TDs to present their own, or their party's, agenda is welcome.  We are legislators so it might get some Members into the mode of examining legislation and producing their own legislative proposals.  Since first having been elected to this House, I have produced a number of pieces of legislation so I know how arduous is that work.  I have produced some single-line Bills which are easy, but I also worked on a substantial Bill last year concerning the control of head shops.  It took an awful lot of work because I wanted to ensure the Bill was correct.  I did not want to present something that could be shot down straight away.While that proposal is welcome therefore, we should not oversell it because it amounts to an extra 28 hours a year, which is not a huge amount.  It comprises only nine such Private Members' opportunities per annum of three hours each, which is not a substantial amount.  In addition, it is shared across the board, so it is not just an Opposition facility but is also available for Government backbenchers.  I know that many Government backbenchers are eager to use this facility when it is presented.The proposal for Friday Dáil sittings is welcome, but it should not be used just to deal with Private Members' business.  If the Chamber is full, we should also transact other business on that day, such as reports or other legislation.  If the House is in session on Fridays, it should be open for the full day rather than three hours.While I want to give a guarded welcome to the proposals, I look forward to working with the Committee on Dáil Reform and the Ceann Comhairle in dealing with other proposals that will be forthcoming for the second phase of Dáil reform, hopefully before Christmas.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Despite the fact the Technical Group is quite disparate, we try to capture the essence of important issues and wish to engage positively in this reform process.  We have quite a lot of ideas, some of which have received broad backing within our group, and others that emanated from individuals.  While we are not opposed to the measures, we do have difficulties with some of them.  Perhaps the biggest difficulty is that there is a big difference between having a vision that is delivered in increments, and a piecemeal approach.  We are concerned that the latter approach is being taken.  We want to see not just Dáil reform but also broader political reform.I acknowledge that this is the first of three increments that have been promised on Dáil reform.  However, it will not be possible to achieve real Dáil reform — where localism is placed where it should be, in the locality — unless there is meaningful local government reform.  We will always be dominated by a local approach unless we also adopt local government reform.  We must see both types of reform as part of a broader vision.Like my Technical Group colleagues, I am in favour of political change, including Dáil reform.  The public deserve nothing less.  It was one of the three big topics raised on doorsteps during the general election campaign.We must strike a balance between a formal and informal process of reform.  The process itself was quite informal and while there was a positive aspect to that, the negative aspect was that there was not enough time towards the end.  That lesson has been learned from this particular process.We would like to have seen Ministers' question time changed so senior Ministers would have to attend the Chamber.  We want to see a proper engagement in a full Chamber.  I am disappointed, however, that is not on the agenda.  It is not just about having people in the Chamber, but also having Members here to do meaningful things that the public can understand.I support some of the points that have already been made concerning Friday sittings of the Dáil.  We feel that such matters could be dealt with on Tuesday mornings, or even by lengthening the Tuesday evening sittings.  We have no difficulty with Friday sittings so long as they are meaningful and include the Order of Business.  We are concerned that having a quorum of ten Members is more about optics, although I acknowledge that what is intended is a serious change.We would like to have seen something more serious done to address the issue of guillotines.  Another issue with which we have serious concerns, is the inability of Members to raise points they feel strongly about.  Earlier this week, Deputy Mattie McGrath was asked to leave the House because he wanted to make a point he felt strongly about.  We sought a small change to Standing Order 26 to allow for a brief statement by a representative of each Opposition party or group.  We were not seeking the right for every one of us to make such a statement, but only a representative.  We thought that was a modest proposal to overcome a problem that will arise later this year because it was not addressed in the current batch of measures.  The citizens of this country are sovereign.  The Constitution says absolutely nothing about political parties.  The architecture of the standing orders has been devised by political parties.  We may be a nuisance to many people, but we are here for the next five years if this Government lasts that long.  We want to play a meaningful role, but we do not want to be sidelined where we cannot have somebody stand up to represent our group.  We thought that was a fairly modest change, and I am very disappointed it was not taken on board.  We looked for others, but this was our primary concern with the standing orders.We have concerns about the time limit being put on the Order of Business because we do not know how workable that is if votes are called.  The Ceann Comhairle is then required to restrict people from raising legitimate things, so we have concerns about that.  We are concerned that the topical debates will deliver too much localism.  It will be down to each of us individually to make sure that does not happen.  There was something akin to an education process during the last election campaign.  This crisis happened because the focus of attention was not on national issues.  We must make sure this Dáil stays focused on those national issues.  I think people wanted us to come to this Parliament and not be paid over and above the very generous salary that we receive for roles such as chairing committees.  That has not been addressed here.We provided the Minister of State a comprehensive document on how parties are funded.  Most members of our group do not get party funding and we are not looking for party funding.  A party allowance is paid to the leader of each political party, but that is not possible with independents.  If we agree to employ additional people to make our group function better, that should not be criticised.We would also like to have seen less focus on the Whip system.  There are independent thinkers in all political parties, as well as the independents.  We would like to have seen a relaxation of the party Whip system to take account of that.  We will continue to engage in the process, but we want to see that the process is meaningful and that this Dáil is a very different place at the end of its lifetime.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome the efforts to reform the Dáil.  Although I was not here before to know what it was like, we felt some frustration at the procedures and protocols when it came to making the Dáil a place that can really be responsive to the issues that confront the country and which are brought to us by the public.  I welcome the fact that the suggestions to bring in a stricter dress code were taken off the agenda, because people are overwhelmingly interested in political substance and not in style.There are several good things in these proposals.  Changing the Adjournment debates to topical debates and taking them in the middle of the day is a very positive proposal.  The extension of Dáil sitting time on Tuesday and Friday to allow Private Members' Bills is a very positive move.  There may be more required, but I welcome the fact that the Government sees this as the first part of a review of these procedures.  It is a welcome change that we can question ministerial answers, as they are sometimes unsatisfactory.  I should have a better knowledge of the standing orders, but it would be good if we moved away from completely scripted responses from the Government.  Frankly, it is often difficult to work out what people are saying when they are reading from scripts.More people should be in the Chamber for Ministers' questions.  That is a basic reform that would reflect the public's expectations, which is to see more people in here.  If we want to be heard, we should come in here.  That seems to be a very reasonable proposal.I would like to see some change in the Order of Business.  This is not a criticism of the Ceann Comhairle, who is simply operating according to existing standing orders.  I would like to see those standing orders loosened up a bit, not to make it a free-for-all, but to allow for very topical current issues to be raised at that point.People Before Profit and the Socialist Party are entitled to some party support, but we agree with the technical group that independents should have some support.  People like Deputy Murphy are doing great amounts of work, but they do not get the resources that political parties receive for doing that work.  It seems only fair and reasonable that they should get some support for that.Substantially reducing the amount of time allowed for questions to the Taoiseach in the Dáil is a retrograde step and I ask the Government to reconsider it.  Time should be allocated on two days, but if it is to be reduced to one day, why not make it as long as Ministers' questions?  These last an hour and a quarter.

I thank everybody who contributed to the debate.  There has been much proactive debate about the issue of Dáil reform in recent months.  I remind the Fianna Fáil Party Whip that the only reform introduced in the 14 years of the last Government was for Leaders' Questions.  That was introduced by the Ceann Comhairle at the time because the Opposition leader, Deputy Noonan, put huge pressure on the procedures that were allowed for questioning the leader of that Government.  That was the only reason it was introduced at the time.  It was not introduced specifically by the Chief Whip.  These reforms today might not go the whole way of reforming how the House works, but they are a path to making this a better debating Chamber than it has been in recent years.Deputy Murphy spoke about Members being in the Chamber.  I know of three committees that are currently sitting, including the health committee and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Members of the technical group seem very concerned about having Members present in the Chamber, but I have only seen two members of that group present during this debate on Dáil reform.  It is very easy to say that we must have 60 or 70 Members in the Chamber on a full-time basis, but other work of the House must also continue.I refer to the work of the committees, party work, and representational work involving meeting groups and delegations.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	255	That is not what we said.

We have to take that into account.  People might have criticised the proposal to have Friday sittings but I believe they can work.  It is a new proposal.  Friday sittings of this House are very rare.  Giving Members from all of sides of the House a chance to introduce their own Private Members' Bill represents a huge opportunity for people.  I very much look forward to people who have been grandstanding for the last while about not having sufficient time or the opportunity to bring forward legislation to now doing so.  I look forward to Deputy Boyd Barrett, Deputy Higgins and others bringing forward their own Private Members' Bills.  When one brings forward a Private Members' Bill, one does not simply write the provisions to be included in it on the back of cigarette box.  Meaningful thought and research is involved in that process.  I very much look forward to that happening.  We have excellent research facilities in the Library and Research Service of the House.  The staff there would be only too willing to assist Members to bring forward their proposals.  I very much look forward to Members across the divide in the House bringing forward their proposals.On the streamlining of the Order of Business, everyone would agree that the Order of Business can turn into a circus at times.  That is why we propose to limit the time of the Order of Business to 30 minutes on a Tuesday and a Wednesday and to 20 minutes on a Thursday morning.  This Chamber is about passing laws, Bills and legislation.  We need only consider the amount of time devoted to debating legislation in this House, but that is what we were elected to do.  We were elected to debate legislation in the House as a national Parliament.It is also important for people to be able to bring up local issues.  Some people might call that parish pump politics but it is about bringing local issues to the attention of the House and that of the relevant Minister and for him or her to have an opportunity to reply to them.We are extending the time allocated for oral parliamentary questions to Ministers on a Tuesday and the Dáil will sit earlier on a Tuesday.  I want to ensure that a senior Minister, or a Minister relevant to the Department to which a Private Members' Bill is being addressed, will be present for the topical issue debate and debates on Private Members' Bills to give his on her view on the matter being debated.I thank everyone for their co-operation.  I believe this is a positive step forward for all Members.  I believe it will ensure the Executive is held more to account.

The dress code at the moment states that Members' dress should be in keeping with the dignity of the House.  The decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was to clarify what that means.  That decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges stands and is dependent on when it is implemented, if and when a motion to change the existing code or to correct it or to give it a proper meaning is implemented.

Amendment No. 11 adds another subsection to section 21 of the Bill to amend section 75 of the Employment Equality Act of 1998.  Its purpose is to remedy an omission in the Act of 1998 to protect the independent functions of the officer delegated to hear and issue a decision in a discrimination case.Section 75(7) of the Act of 1998 refers to the arrangements under which delegation to an equality officer by the director of the function of hearing a case will operate.  However, this provision currently refers only to cases referenced under section 77 of the Act in relation to employment matters.  It does not make reference to cases referred under section 21 Act of 2000 concerning discrimination in the supply of and access to goods and services or under section 86 of the Act of 1998 concerning collective bargaining.  It is proposed to correct these omissions by the amendments now proposed.  It is an important tidying-up measure in the context of the relevant legislation and I hope it will be supported by the House.

In page 8, to delete lines 12 and 13 and substitute the following:"(10) Sections 6, 12 and 29(g) and sections 48 to 54 shall come into operation on such day or”.Amendment No. 5 is designed to ensure, as the text of the Bill is now being finalised, that the commencement provision is correct in regard to those sections of the Bill that will require a commencement order.Amendments Nos. 19 to 25, inclusive, relate to the transfer of the family mediation service to the Legal Aid Board, something that was mentioned at an earlier Stage of the Bill but the amendments to provide for which we did not have an opportunity previously to table.  The promotion of mediation in the legal system is a commitment in the programme for Government.  On Second Stage I said that, if possible, I would try to include in the Bill provisions for the transfer of the family mediation service to the Legal Aid Board.  With the considerable assistance of the Attorney General's office, the Parliamentary Counsel, the Legal Aid Board and my own officials, it is now possible to make legislative provision for this transfer.I want to outline briefly the background involved to this proposal.  The family mediation service, as Deputies know, assists people who have decided to separate or divorce and wish to avoid going through an adversarial process to negotiate their own agreement with the help of a mediator.  Couples are encouraged to consult lawyers as they progress through the mediation process to ensure the final agreement is sustainable.The service is offered to married, unmarried and same-sex couples and individuals whomay have a child as a result of a very brief relationship.  Family mediation can also helpfamily members to resolve disputes such as sibling care of elderly parents, inheritance and child access and custody in cases of deceased parents.  The process is voluntary and each individual has to confirm his or her willingness to attend mediation meetings.  Mediation leads to better outcomes for families and children and the process is less adversarial and expensive than the courts.In so far as I have any expertise in this area, I should declare an interest in that part of my professional training was in mediation to assist in the resolution of commercial and family disputes so that people do not have to go through the court system.  For many years I have been an enthusiast for mediation.  I had no involvement in the State mediation service but as a family solicitor I referred a number of individuals to it in the hope that they could resolve their difficulties, particularly in cases of broken marriages, without resorting to the courts.The Family Mediation Service is staffed by professionally trained and accredited family mediators.  It was established in 1986 as a three year pilot project under the Department of Justice.  As a backbencher in this House during the 1980s I recall advocating for a mediation service.  It is the first publicly funded mediation scheme in Europe.  In 1993, the service was transferred to the newly formed Department of Equality and Law Reform and it moved again in 1998 to the reconstituted Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The Family Support Agency Act 2001 came into operation in 2003 to establish the Family Support Agency as a statutory agency.  The Family Mediation Service came under the umbrella of that agency as one of its functions in terms of providing a direct service to the public.The agency is now under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and, in turn, the Government has decided that the service should come under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is appropriate that it is now being taken under the wing of the Legal Aid Board, having regard to the fact that the overwhelming majority of work done by the board and its law centres pertains to family law, the need to ensure cohesion and integration of services and providing a direct link between legal aid and the alternative of engaging in mediation.  We can benefit from synergies between these two services by having the Family Mediation Service under the aegis of the Legal Aid Board.  Furthermore, it is ceasing to travel every time Departments are rearranged, which is not helpful in terms of developing a coherent service in the public interest.In May 2011, I launched the Dolphin House family mediation initiative, which is a joint initiative by the Legal Aid Board, the Family Mediation Service and the Courts Service.  Dolphin House houses the District Court in Dublin which deals with a substantial number of family proceedings, including child custody, guardianship, access, maintenance applications and barring and safety orders.  This pilot initiative provides mediation and legal aid services within the same location, with a view to encouraging more people to avail of mediation at less cost and stress when seeking to resolve disputes relating to custody and access.  Initial indications on uptake are encouraging and it is expected that it will prove to be a blueprint for such services in the future.  In recent years the Legal Aid Board has taken an active role in encouraging and facilitating greater use of mediation by its own solicitors and other options to help resolve marriage disputes in general.  Its chairperson, Ms Anne Colley, also acts as chair of a steering group on the Dolphin House initiative.I pay tribute to Ms Colley for the role she played as chairperson of the Legal Aid Board.  She is approaching the end of her term and because of the statutory provision she is not eligible for reappointment.  She performed an important and valuable function in her role as chair of the Legal Aid Board and Members on all sides of the House should recognise that she has shown an extraordinary commitment to her role.In course of developing the Dolphin House initiative, it has become apparent that the Family Mediation Service could operate more efficiently and effectively if it is integrated with the Legal Aid Board.  The Legal Aid Board would also benefit from the exercise because it would be in a position to steer the mediation service in a way that would increase the numbers using it, reduce demand for legal aid and court time, better establish the status of legal agreements and provide economies in the use of premises through collocation with law centres or courts, where possible.The legislative proposals I am now moving will provide for the following: the transfer of responsibility for administration of the Family Mediation Service to the Legal Aid Board; the necessary amendments of the Family Support Agency Act 2001 and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995; and the transfer of staff and property of the Family Mediation Service to the Legal Aid Board.  The House will agree that it makes good sense to reorganise the Family Mediation Service in the way that I propose.My overall strategy on mediation will at a later stage involve publication of a comprehensive mediation and conciliation Bill to provide a framework for the better operation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in our legal system.  Much more use could be made of alternative dispute resolution and mediation than is currently the case not only in the area of family law but across a range of issues that result in civil litigation.  I am pleased to note that the Commercial Court has made a considerable contribution to encouraging contesting parties and the lawyers representing them to use mediation on occasions where lengthy litigation and substantially costs would otherwise ensue.  Proposals for a mediation and conciliation Bill are at an advanced stage of preparation by my Department and I look forward to bringing it before the House when it is has been completed and approved by the Attorney General.

Will there be any resource implications for the Family Mediation Service as a result of its transfer to the Legal Aid Board?I do not know Ms Anne Colley but the work of the Legal Aid Board under her stewardship has been exemplary, particularly at a time when demands for its services have increased due the economic pressures people are under.  The Minister faces an important task in replacing her because it will be difficult to find someone with the calibre and commitment she has shown in her role.  I wish her well.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The resources that were made available last December to the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service will take them to the end of this year.  The question of what funding will be made available next year has to be considered by the Government in the context of the ongoing expenditure review but the changes we propose will ensure a more efficient use of resources.  Important synergies will be achieved by making available to the Family Mediation Service premises in certain parts of the country which are already occupied by law centres.  At present the operation of the service is somewhat constrained.  I do not know and cannot tell the House what financial envelope of funds may be made available to me for both services.  I regard both as very important and we dealt recently on Question Time with the Legal Aid Board.  The difficulty this year is that based on last year's Estimates, the board is underfunded and because of the recession and so many families being in straitened financial circumstances, there has been a substantial increase in the numbers seeking assistance through centres.I hope that in the context of resources, greater connectivity between the Legal Aid Board and the mediation service will result in many more estranged couples or parents using the service, especially dealing initially with custody and access disputes, many of which could be readily resolved in mediation but unnecessarily end up with hearings in the District Court.  That may produce a resource saving as it may be the case that moneys otherwise spent on legal resources would not be required for particular individuals, freeing up the service for others for whom mediation is not a practical possibility.I hope that we will see, under the encouragement of the Legal Aid Board and the service administered under it, far more people using the mediation service.  Connectivity is important.  The Dolphin House pilot scheme is very important, and one of the successes in mediation in other jurisdictions has been when mediation services have been established in the same building as court structures.  On occasions individuals will, without lawyer advice, issue summons on custody or access issues and not go to mediation.  When there is a mediation service in the building and where court clerks indicate the availability of such a service, a significant number of people may first try to use that type of service.  That has been the experience elsewhere.I see the areas of expansion and greater utilisation of mediation coming from a linking of this service with the administrative structures of the Legal Aid Board.  It could consider some form of internal protocol to encourage the use of mediation.  There would also be a linkage between the board, the mediation service and the Courts Service.  I hope we will have funding in future for the extension of the pilot scheme currently operating in Dolphin House to other courts where a substantial number of family cases are dealt with each year.

In page 22, line 26, to delete "and".In accordance with Standing Order 140, I request the Chair to instruct the Clerk to make a correction in the Bill as amended in the select committee.  The correction is as follows: on page 7, lines 33 and 34, the cross-reference to "section 18 to section 25" should be updated to read "sections 18 to 26", to take account of the new section being inserted by amendment No. 15.  I am required to bring this technical change to the attention of the House.Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are technical and improve the text.  Amendment No. 14 adds another subsection to section 24 whose purpose is to clarify an ambiguity that arose in the amendment by the Equality Act 2004 of the text of section 79(6) of the Employment Equality Act 1998.  So as to allow the Equality Tribunal to deal with certain procedural and factual issues, a new subsection (3A) was inserted in section 79 of the 1998 Act by the Equality Act 2004.  The tribunal already had this power with regard to one specific instance under section 79(3) relating to the question of whether different rates of pay are lawful under section 19(5) and section 29(5).  These sections provide that an employer is not prevented from paying different rates of pay to different employees on grounds other than discriminatory grounds.A consequential amendment made by the Equality Act 2004 to section 79(6) does not make clear that subsection (6)(b) was also to be amended to refer to the new subsection (3A).  This ambiguity is addressed by the proposed amendment, although I appreciate my explanation for it is somewhat complex.  It is merely to tidy up an anomaly arising under legislation.Amendment No. 15 corrects an omission in the Equality Act 2004.  So as to allow the Equality Tribunal to deal with certain procedural and factual issues as preliminary matters, a new subsection (3A) was inserted in section 79 of the 1998 Act by the Equality Act 2004.  The tribunal already had this power with regard to one specific instance under section 79(3) relating to the question of whether different rates of pay are lawful under section 19(5) and section 29(5).  These sections provide that an employer is not prevented from paying different rates of pay to different employees on grounds other than discriminatory grounds.  Section 83(5) of the 1998 Act, which provides for an appeal to the Labour Court against a decision of the director under section 79(3) and for referral of cases back to the director on resolution of preliminary issues, was not amended by the 2004 Act to include a corresponding reference to section 79(3A).  The amendment is proposed to remedy this anomaly.  As is clear to Deputies, there is a direct link between amendments Nos. 14 and 15, which are essentially to address the same difficulty that arose, depending on to whom the application was made to address an issue.  These are technical amendments which I hope the House will support.

by the insertion in subsection (2)(a) of “, or is the civil partner of,” after “related by blood, affinity or adoption to”, and(ii) by the insertion in subsection (2)(b) of “, or was the civil partner

declarations) to vouch the application as the Minister may require.",(f) in section 19(1)(e), by the substitution for “act other than marriage” of “act, other than marriage or entry into a civil partnership,”,(g) by the substitution of the following section for section 20:20.—Acquisition of Irish citizenship by a person shall not of itself confer Irish citizenship on his or her spouse or

children.(2) Loss of Irish citizenship by a person shall not of itself affect the citizenship of his or her spouse, civil partner or children.",and(i) by the substitution of the following section for section 23 (amended by section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001):23.—A person who marries, or enters into a civil partnership with, a non-national shall not, merely by virtue of the marriage or civil partnership, cease to be an Irish citizen, whether or not he or she acquires the nationality of the non-national.".".This deals with the issue of citizenship, which we have discussed at some length during the course of this Bill's passage through the Houses.  The purpose of the amendment is to make the necessary amendments to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts to give effect to the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  Deputies will recall that I stated my intention to bring forward, as far as possible in the Bill, amendments to achieve that end.  During the various Stages we have agreed certain changes to a number of sections in the relevant citizenship Acts, and much of the text of section 32 was agreed during Committee Stage debates.For example, we provided statutory backing for citizenship ceremonies and improved recognition of the position of civil partners, thus making it easier for them to acquire citizenship.  My amendment proposes the replacement of section 32 in its entirety so as to provide clarity on the legal position without having to visit a series of different enactments.  I should explain that this is essentially a technical drafting device recommended by the Parliamentary Counsel to assist Deputies in better understanding what is being proposed, both in its entirety and in additional new elements  It will also assist the public and those who may give advice to individuals.I propose to highlight those new elements regarding civil partners and citizenship ceremonies now being included on Report Stage, some of which were mentioned by me during the course of Second or Committee Stages.  Paragraph (a) inserts a new definition of “civil partner” in section 2 of the 1956 Act.  That is clearly necessary because of the changes we are making.  Paragraph (b) provides for an amended description of a “citizenship ceremony” to allow such a ceremony to be held before “such other person as may be designated for that purpose by the Minister”, in addition to a judge or a retired judge.  Such a person could be a county registrar, for example.  Deputies will recall that when provision was originally made for citizenship ceremonies, it was stated that the swearing of the oath should take place before a judge or retired judge.  As an individual of that nature might not be always available in circumstances in which a ceremony should take place, I have decided it is appropriate for the Minister of the day to be able to designate some other appropriate individual to administer the oath.  This amendment will allow that to happen.Further to what I mentioned earlier, I would like to inform the House that a series of citizenship ceremonies will take place in Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines on Thursday and Friday of next week.  A large number of people to whom citizenship has been granted will swear oaths and receive citizenship parchments or certificates.  We hope to arrange a further citizenship ceremony outside Dublin in August, perhaps in Templemore.  I am not sure if a retired or sitting judge will be available in August to administer the oath.

In page 39, to delete lines 36 to 44.On Committee Stage, I raised the question of the number of possible fees that could be charged as a result of the changes we are making.  Under the current proposals, one might have to pay a fee on application and, if one's application is successful, another fee on receipt.  We have discussed the reasoning behind it.  Currently, if somebody is not granted permission, we have no way of getting any funding to recoup some of the resources we spent processing the application.  It is important to bring some clarity to the matter.  That is why a single fee would be appropriate.  It is open to the Minister to determine whether the fee should be imposed on application or on the granting of permission.  I ask him to consider accepting these amendments to bring some clarity to the matter.  I do not think we should penalise people who are successful by making them pay a second fee.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I appreciate that previously the Deputy raised this issue and we discussed it.  Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2004, as currently drafted, only makes provision for a fee to be charged for the giving of a permission under the Act.  There is no provision for an application fee to be charged.  My proposed replacement for that section remedies that situation by making it possible to charge an application fee, a fee for the giving of the permission, or both.  The Deputy's amendment would prevent me from doing this.  The effect of his amendment No. 17 would be to delete the proposed new section 19(1)(a), which makes provision for the charging of a fee for an application for a permission, the giving of a permission, or both.  Amendment No. 18, which is also in the Deputy’s name, seeks to amend section 19(1)(b) so that it provides for the power to charge a fee either for an application for a permission or the giving of a permission, but not both.  It would also have the effect of waiving the registration charge in any case where the person has paid an application fee — not just when the foreign national registers for the first time, but also at renewal stage.  It also prescribes that application fees should be paid to the registration officer, as opposed to the Minister, even though the registration officer may have no dealings with the case, for instance in an unsuccessful application.  My proposed text would be a standard application fee to be charged in respect of permissions.  That fee would be set at a level that would cover the administrative costs associated with receiving and investigating the application.  If the application is granted, an additional fee could be payable.  If the application is refused, no additional fee would be payable.  If I were to be precluded from having this flexibility, as would be the case under the Deputy’s amendment, I would have to set much higher application fees.  In this manner, failed applicants would be subsidising the cost of giving permission to successful applicants.  Under the circumstances, I am afraid I cannot accept Deputy O’Brien’s amendments.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	284	We are looking at two separate fees, one on application and one on permission.  Is that what is proposed?  In my amendments, I am proposing that there should be a single fee.  There is no reason the fee cannot be the same in both circumstances, regardless of whether it is paid at the start, or over two stages.  I do not understand from where the Minister is coming.  Nothing in my amendments would prevent the Minister from charging a fee on application that would cover the entire process, including the registration of the certificate.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify that.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	285	As I explained previously, the difficulty arises in the cases of people who are unsuccessful in their applications.  There is a benefit to one when one's application is successful.  As matters stand, successful applicants essentially meet the expenses incurred by the State in determining the applications of unsuccessful applicants.  It would be unfair to charge an unsuccessful applicant the full sum that would arise if the application were successful.  That sum is partially based on a recognition of the benefits that accrue to an individual from a successful application.  It would be unfair to maintain the current position whereby successful applicants meet the expense incurred in the processing of applications that are unsuccessful, some of which should not have been made in the first place.  We want to create a degree of flexibility in this respect.  That is why we are providing for the possibility of charging a relatively modest sum to applicants and levying a further charge on those who are successful.  That is the intent and purpose of this section of the Bill.  If we were to provide that the entire sum should be paid on application, it may act as a barrier to some individuals whose applications are inevitably going to be unsuccessful from making an application in the first instance.  However, it could be unfair to some people who have no certainty as to the outcome of their applications.  If unsuccessful, they would end up incurring the same level of expense as a person whose application succeeded.  It is for that reason — not to be stubborn or unnecessarily difficult — that I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.

Considering the number of amendments, we probably should have had a little more time on it.Anything that diminishes the standing of the Irish language must be opposed by all Deputies in this House.  I repeat my complete shock on hearing that it was the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht who asked for this amendment to be included.  We will be pressing the amendment to a vote.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I tabled a number of amendments which were ruled out for various reasons earlier and they capture my view of this section of the Bill.  It is a dilution of the standing of the Irish language, which in many ways has only been achieved in recent years, especially since the passage of the Official Languages Act 2003.  Prior to that, it had a standing in theory but it was not as well implemented as it should have been.This is not necessarily the proper place for it in this legislation, but I have argued that all Bills should be contemporaneously published in the Irish language and the English language to allow us who wish to partake in a debate fully in the Irish language to do so, as, supposedly, is our right under the Constitution.  We have not been able to enjoy that in this Dáil, nor in previous Dála.  The only sop to the Irish language is that I can partake in the debate.  I can contribute to this debate in the Irish language but I cannot contribute in writing to it.  If I proposed amendments in Irish to legislation which is published in English, they would be ruled out, as amendments have been in the past.This is part of a trend since this Government has come into being.  It began with the passage of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011, where the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003 were set aside on that occasion as well.  Here, again, the Official Languages Act 2003 is being set aside to facilitate more dilution of it.This is at a time when we are told there is a review of the Official Languages Act 2003.  After the review, there might be some logic in the Minister stating that this provision would be required.  However, prior to a review, there is none to start undermining an Act which is only in being eight years.Subsequently, the Irish language had an increased status given to it by recognition in the European Union and here the Government is undermining at home that recognition and what was gained after a long campaign for many years.  It is a retrograde step.I will not unduly delay this because I argued most of the points on Committee Stage.  In fact, all Committee Stage did was ensure that I would continue to fight this, which was the reason I tabled a number of amendments which stated there would be a sunset clause to this provision or that there would be other provisions which would prevent it occurring immediately or forever more.My preference is to delete this section.  The other amendment I suggested is that, if anything, the only provision should be that it could be published in the official State language if the Government would only publish it in one, namely the Irish language.  I guarantee that would never happen and it would be published in both languages.  There are few, if any, Bills or Acts which have been published in the Irish language only.  It is easy to translate from the Irish language to the English language but there seems to be some type of a hiccup when it is the other way round.  It would be much easier if, from the start, the Bills were published in both languages and then the amendments could be tracked and there would be virtually contemporaneous publication of the Acts in both languages shortly after their passage in the Houses of Oireachtas, as is done in many other Parliaments which are dealing with bilingual or trilingual societies.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I support Deputy O'Brien's amendment.  It is unfortunate that we must split, because this has been a good debate on this legislation, because the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, has asked the Minister, Deputy Shatter to do it.  Quite frankly, it is unbelievable that An Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta is looking for this provision, which seems to be in every piece of legislation.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht today and it was ruled out of order because of the context of this debate.The Official Languages Act 2003 is not perfect.  It certainly has done much good, but it needs to be reviewed and streamlined.  By inserting this clause we are doing what we have done with previous legislation, that is to say, giving direction to that review.  Effectively, we are making the point in advance of that review starting that we intend to downgrade the status of the Irish language.  Our MEPs were in the House before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs today.  We have fought long and hard to have Irish recognised as an official working language of the European Union. However, through this and other legislation we are attempting to diminish its status here and on that basis we support the amendments.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Amendments Nos. 26 to 28, inclusive, proposed by Deputies Ó Snodaigh and O'Brien relate to attempts to delete or amend the practical proposal in regard to immediate publication on the Internet of Bills in one of the official languages on enactment while we wait for several weeks for the translation in the other official language to become available.I oppose these amendments.  I have given the reasons behind the proposals at all previous Stages of the Bill in the House and I reiterate them.  There is no question of diminishing the status of the Irish language.  The reality is that we enact legislation through English, Bills are initially drafted in English, amendments are tabled in English and they appear initially in their final form in English.  There is no point in engaging in a fiction or pretending it is different and depriving ordinary citizens of the country from having immediate access to legislation passed in the Parliament.  It is an important right of citizens of the State to have ready access and, in so far as we can provide it, instant access to the legislation that we enact through both Houses.  The changes are included in this Bill because it is a miscellaneous provisions Bill and it is a matter of civil law, not criminal law.  It is appropriate that these changes are included in the BillKicking the can down the road on this issue to include it in a different Bill will not change the problem, vary the issue or change the solution.  The situation in practice has been that when Report Stage of Bills has been completed there has been an undue delay between the enactment of the Bills through both Houses and the publication of the final version of Bills as Acts in both the English and Irish languages.  Under the Official Languages Act 2003 the issue is that upon proper and full publication an Act must be published simultaneously in both Irish and English.  Since that legislation was passed, the use of electronic means to communicate has evolved and become more sophisticated.  Deputies can access Bills on the web as they go through the various Stages.  We are in the anomalous position that once a Bill has completed its passage through both Houses it seems that it cannot in its final form be immediately published and made available by way of electronic means because there must be a delay while translations are effected.It makes no sense that access can be gained by electronic means to a Bill after it has passed Committee Stage in its new form, including any amendments, after it has passed Report Stage in one House, after it has passed Committee Stage in a second House, but that once it has completed Report Stage in the second House, that Bill may remain unpublished in its final form for some time.  We must recognise the reality and the rights of citizens to gain access as rapidly as possible to legislation enacted in both Houses when it is in its final form following completion of the legislative process.  The previous Government intended to include in its Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 a provision to address this issue and it had commenced work in that regard.The current Attorney General has given the same advice as her predecessor, that is to say, that it is necessary to do this because there is a frailty in the law and it is unwise that we postpone it at any further.  As I have stated already, the amendment was requested to be included in the Bill by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and it is the advice of the Attorney General that it was necessary to be so included.  There is no benefit to the workings of the House, to the people or to citizens living outside this country who may have an interest in legislation being passed in the House that may impact on their lives, that following or completing the process they cannot access it immediately in its final form through electronic means.  This applies as much to this measure as it does to all measures enacted in the past.  The benefit is that when this change is made in the case of all future legislation enacted within a short period after this process is complete the legislation will become available to those who wish to access it.

This is a short but important Bill and if it completes its passage through the Seanad next week, the effect will be to ensure the courts will be in a position to implement it on their return in September after the summer vacation.  In a case in which someone is convicted of a criminal offence and the judge is considering imposing a sentence of one year or less, an obligation will be imposed on members of the Judiciary to first consider the appropriateness of community service as an alternative to imprisonment.  This constitutes a good change in public policy and I hope it will result in far greater use of the mechanism of community service orders to the overall benefit of the community, while at the same time saving the State money with regard to short-term imprisonments which do not achieve a great deal and in general are of no benefit to the community.  I again thank Members opposite for their assistance in facilitating the completion of the passage of the Bill on the last sitting day before the summer vacation.

I am conscious of the importance of the legislative process and, equally, the value of the time of the House.  Therefore, given the miscellaneous nature of the Bill, it was deemed to be an appropriate manner in which to deal with a number of issues which required attention but which of themselves would not justify the initiation of separate legislation.  I will outline for Members the nature of the amendments under consideration.The amendments I propose to local government law will substitute new provisions for the existing code in respect of the changing of placenames which is set out in Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001.  Other than section 197, the remaining provisions of Part 18 have not been commenced, due principally to the difficulty of local government law and the Official Languages Act 2003 working in harmony.  In the absence of commencement, the Local Government Act 1946, as amended, provides the relevant statutory framework.The new Part 18 will restate large elements of the existing code but with significant changes and some new provisions.  In an effort to streamline the legislation, it will provide that the placename provisions are contained within one section, as opposed to four sections of the 2001 Act.  Any proposal adopted by a local authority to change a placename must specify the proposed name in Irish only or in English and in Irish.  There will be an explicit requirement that any plebiscite held must be by way of secret ballot and all proposals will require a resolution adopted by half of the total members of the council.The incompatibility between local government law and the Official Languages Act has been brought into sharp focus by the long running controversy over the name of An Daingean, or Dingle.  The amendment will also seek to solve that problem in section 191 of the new Part 18.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	306	He failed to do it, but I am doing it.   As Members might recall, the official name of Dingle was changed to An Daingean by the Placenames (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) Order of December 2004 made by the Minster for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the Official Languages Act 2003.  As is well documented at this stage, the change in name has provoked an extended debate, with significant opposition locally based on a perceived lack of consultation prior to the making of the placenames order and the wish to preserve the name "Dingle" from a tourism perspective.  A campaign was established to change the name of the town to Dingle-Daingean Uí Chúis under the change of placename provisions of the Local Government Act 1946, as amended, to which I referred.  In September 2005, the Attorney General advised that the local government code may not be used to change the name of a place already subject to a placenames order, as in the case of An Daingean and this advice was notified to Kerry County Council, the sponsoring authority for such a procedure under local government law.  Notwithstanding the advice, the council proceeded to hold a plebiscite under the Local Government Act 1946, as amended, to ascertain whether the majority of qualified electors in the town consented to an application being made to the Government for an order to change the name of An Daingean to Dingle Daingean Uí Chúis.  The proposal put to the electorate was carried overwhelmingly.  Kerry County Council then resolved to apply to the Government to make an order under section 77 of the Local Government Act 1946, to change the name to Dingle Daingean Uí Chúis.  However, in view of the earlier advice of the Attorney General, it was not possible to accede to the council's request.  Subsequent efforts by the previous Government to introduce legislation to deal with this issue were unsuccessful and I am, therefore, availing of the earliest possible legislative opportunity to undo the impact of the 2004 placenames order as it applies to An Daingean and to provide, in law, that the name of the town in the English language will be Dingle and in the Irish language will be Daingean Uí Chúis.Of more general application, the proposals before the House today provide a more coherent, modern and streamlined set of procedures for changing placenames.  They allow for greater recognition to be given to the Irish language generally when placename changes are proposed and they set responsibility for this function at local level, where it should properly reside.The office of the Attorney General has advised that the insertion of a new part into the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, is urgently required to provide essential technical amendments to the Planning Acts.  The amendments do not depart from the policy intent behind the amendments made by way of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.  The amendments in question will enable the commencement of certain provisions in the 2010 Planning Act, which further implement the environmental impact assessment directive and the birds and habitats directives.  Certain amendments are required to settle EU complaints against Ireland and so must be urgently commenced to avoid incurring European Community fines.I now wish to provide an overview of the planning amendments included in the new Part 4.  Sections 8 and 9 amendments are standard definition sections.  Section 10 is a technical amendment which restates the amendment to section 4 of the 2000 Planning Act, made by way of section 5 of the 2010 Planning Act, with required transitional provisions now included.  Section 11 amends section 13 of the Planning Acts on foot of the transfer of the heritage function to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the role of that Minister in varying development plans.  Section 12 is a consequential amendment to section 30 of the Planning Acts which is on foot of technical revision in this Bill to Part XAB of the Planning Acts.  Section 13 amends section 50A of the Planning Acts to the effect that a court may now grant leave to apply for judicial review of planning applications, appeals, referrals and other matters where the applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter which is the subject of the application.  Section 14 amends section 50B of the Planning Acts, which deals with legal costs in certain environmental matters.  Sections 15, 16 and 17 are technical amendments to sections 57, 82 and 87 of the Planning Acts to clarify that exemptions given in the planning regulations do not apply to works to a protected structure or proposed protected structure and further, do not apply to works in architectural conservation areas or special planning control areas.  Sections 18, 19 and 20 provide technical amendments to sections 130, 135 and 153 of the Planning Acts, respectively.  Sections 21 and 22 provide technical amendments to sections 157 and 160 of the Planning Acts.  These new sections have the same policy intent as sections 47 and 48 of the 2010 Planning Act but provide clearer legal text.  Section 23 provides a technical amendment to section 170 of the Planning Acts to correctly reference Part X of the Planning Acts, which relates to Environmental Impact Assessment.  Section 24 technically modifies the definition of "candidate special protection area".  Sections 25 to 29 are amendments to Part XAB of the Planning Acts to reflect the transfer of responsibility for heritage functions to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Sections 30 to 33 technically amend sections 181A, 181B, 182A and 182C.  Section 34 amends the Seventh Schedule of the Planning Acts to clarify the type of health infrastructural development that should be sent directly to An Bord Pleanála under the strategic consent process.  Section 35 provides for the repeal of certain sections of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, which required technical amendment through this Bill.The motion also provides for the inclusion of a number of new amendments in the Bill which, on the advice of the Attorney General, are necessary before the State can ratify the Aarhus Convention.  They include a provision for a new costs rule and further provisions to specify the type of court cases to which the new costs rule will apply.  These provisions also seek to give clarity in advance to applicants on the level of legal costs they may incur when taking such cases.  As Deputies will be aware, the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, better known as the Aarhus Convention, was adopted in June 1998.  The convention lays down a set of basic rules to promote citizens' involvement in environmental decision-making.  Ireland is the only EU member state yet to ratify the convention and commitment is pledged in the programme for Government to complete ratification.  With Ireland's Presidency of the European Union approaching in the first half of 2013, it is important that ratification takes place as soon as possible.  The convention is linked to environmental legislation generally and is particularly relevant to decision-making on licensing issues such as waste licensing and air pollution licensing, for example.  Owing to the relevance of the convention to a wide spectrum of environmental legislation, it is considered appropriate to include the necessary legislative provisions in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.A technical amendment to section 70 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 was agreed on Committee Stage to complete implementation of Article 5 and the Committee Stage amendments proposed today will complete implementation of a number of other articles of the convention.The amendment proposed to Section 6(2A) of the Local Government Act 1998, as amended by the Local Government (Roads Functions) Act 2007, will allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport the power to expend moneys from the local government fund on all public roads -national, regional and local — and on the provision of public transport infrastructure.  The local government fund was established under the Local Government Act 1998 and is financed from motor taxation receipts and an annual contribution from the Exchequer.  Under section 3(2) of the Local Government Act 1998, as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, I have responsibility for managing and controlling the fund.  Responsibility for non-national roads transferred from my Department to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2008.  A protocol arrangement between the two Departments provided that funding for non-national roads would continue to be channelled on an annual basis from the local government fund to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This amendment will allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport discretion in the allocation of local government fund moneys within his responsibilities for national and non-national roads and the provision of public transport infrastructure.  This will permit the effective targeting of investment to those areas of transport infrastructure of highest national priority.I have set out for the House the reasons for these necessary amendments and I ask that this motion be passed to allow for a formal discussion of these amendments during Report Stage of this Bill.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Fianna Fáil will not oppose this motion.  I thank the Minister for his statement to the House.  He has introduced a number of initiatives which had been discussed on Committee Stage.The initiative regarding placenames is welcome.  The Dingle situation was closely followed, especially by those living in the county.  A similar but not such a high profile situation occurred in County Limerick with regard to the changing of the name of the village of Doon in east County Limerick.  I welcome the clarification and the introduction of a clear set of guidelines as to how placenames may be altered if this is the will of the majority of the people.I ask for clarification regarding some provisions outlined by the Minister:Section 13 amends section 50A of the Planning Acts to the effect that a court may now grant leave to apply for judicial review of planning applications, appeals, referrals and other matters where the applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter which is the subject of the application.I ask the Minister to expand on his definition of "sufficient interest".On the readvertising, the Minister has provided for significant further information to be lodged as part of a planning application.  People in an adjoining property can seek leave to apply to An Bord Pleanála to appeal a decision if they have not made a submission in the first instance to the planning authority.  I ask the Minister to clarify that for us when he gets an opportunity.Also, the Minister mentioned section 47.  In regard to sections 21 and 22, these new sections have the same policy intent as sections 47 and 48 of the Planning Act but provide clearer legal text.  My understanding of section 47 is that it is to do with sterilisation orders.  Is that correct?  The Minister might expand on that.  According to the rural house guidelines, section 47 should be used in exceptional circumstances, but it is my experience in Limerick County Council that nearly every grant of planning permission for a single rural house is accompanied by a section 47 sterilisation order.  The follow-on from that is that every grant of planning permission is an exceptional circumstance, and I would not like to think that is the case.  We need to focus more, be it in this House or in committee, on section 47 and sterilisation orders because my experience is that local authorities are engaging in brinkmanship with applicants in that when deciding on a file, they tell them that if they sterilise the entire farm holding, they will give them planning permission and so on.  That section is being abused to some extent.The Minister mentioned health infrastructure developments.  Is that to do with 100 bed facilities in that if an application is made for a facility in excess of 100 beds, it would have to go straight to An Bord Pleanála for a decision on planning permission rather than through the local authority?  There may be merit in examining the possibility of making it apply to, say, a 50 or 60 bed facility because we have an under-supply of health facilities.  I ask the Minister to clarify those issues when replying.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I thank Deputy Niall Collins for sharing time.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011.  I resent the way this legislation is being rushed through the House.  Sixty five minutes is not enough time to debate it, and we all know the reason for that.  The legislation as amended by the Government represents another major U-turn and broken promise.I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and Deputy Kevin Humphreys to the Chamber because I have just received some information today that the Minister and the Deputy will be interested to hear.  I do not know whether the Minister realises it but he is already making a name for himself across the north side of Dublin where he is called Poll Tax Phil with the introduction of these new charges.  I thought he should know that he is now a brand name in that area.On the legislation, I remind Deputies that the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, stated she would fight tooth and nail to stop the incinerator in Poolbeg, and Deputy Kevin Humphreys criticised the former Minister, John Gormley, for not doing enough in that regard.  Deputy Kevin Humphreys has reneged on his commitments in the most cynical way, but what is worse is that the Taoiseach gave a written commitment to the people of Dublin South-East that he would stop this incinerator going ahead.  I will return to that later as I have a copy of the letter before me.  This is a Taoiseach who does not have a shred of credibility left in regard to promises.  He promised to deliver many things to many communities knowing full well that he would have to turn his back on those people once they had voted for his party.  That is a serious allegation.The deletion of the incineration levy is yet another stunning U-turn by this Government.  The coalition parties never ceased to criticise the previous Minister on this issue and yet it is now clear from the statements made by Covanta that had the provision for the incineration levy remained in the legislation, this oversized incinerator for the Poolbeg peninsula would not be going ahead.  In an article published in The Sunday Business Post before the election, a representative for the company stated clearly that it would not proceed as long as this provision remained.  The article also stated that the company had met Deputy Enda Kenny and Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  The Covanta aide said they were happy with the meeting.  One wonders what was said by the Taoiseach at that meeting.The more one reads about this project and the capitulation of the coalition, the more suspicious one becomes.  It is a project that has been shrouded in secrecy with no democratic accountability.  Only recently the Minister published the Hennessy report on the financial viability of the plant but with large sections of the report censored.  So much for the transparency the Government talked about in the past.  The report shows that this is a mad contract which will cost the taxpayer dearly if Covanta does not get sufficient waste.  Have we learned nothing?  We only have to look at the mess of the M3 public private partnership and the Limerick tunnel, where the lack of cars means major penalties for the State.  Is it not extraordinary that there has been no democratic scrutiny of this contract?  Not a single councillor, TD or Minister had seen the contract.  That is why the senior counsel, John Hennessy, asked the then Minister, John Gormley, to examine the contract.  I understand that even Mr. Hennessy had considerable difficulty getting his hands on the contract.The Government has chosen to ignore the Hennessy report.  It has also chosen to ignore the international review on waste management which argued cogently for the imposition of an incineration levy to drive waste higher up the waste hierarchy and get the very best rates of recycling.  Why has the Minister decided to dump the international review drawn up by international experts?  At a time when resources are growing scarce, when peak oil is a reality and when we have to reduce our carbon emissions substantially, it makes no sense at all to opt for an incinerator on this scale.  In order for it to be profitable it will have to draw waste from every part of the island and perhaps beyond.  Is that sustainable?  This is a national issue.  It is not an issue specific to one constituency.  That is the reason I raise it in the House today.There are other aspects of this deal which deserve closer attention.  Mr. PJ Rudden is often quoted in the media as a waste expert who favours the incinerator.  None of these newspaper reports state that Mr. Rudden's company has made €25 million in consultancy fees from the project.  Is it any wonder he is in favour of it?The other major question is the reason Dublin City Council decided to proceed with the preliminary contract during the 2007 election campaign and why it proceeded to sign the contract when the Minister warned it not to do so.  A lot would come out in the wash if there was an inquiry on this matter but with the way this Government has pandered to the wishes of big business, it is unlikely that we will get such an inquiry.I will deal with some of the issues I mentioned earlier in regard to broken promises.  The website of the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, on 13 July 2010, stated:Fine Gael remains committed to stopping the proposed incinerator in Poolbeg.  Lucinda recently sought assurances from Fine Gael party leader Enda Kenny that the party would oppose the construction of the proposed incinerator if elected to government.  Deputy Kenny unequivocally confirmed that Fine Gael would continue to fight tooth and nail to oppose the incinerator.She further stated: "Lucinda again calls on Minister John Gormley to stand by his promises to the people of Dublin South East and scrap the incinerator for once and for all".  That is another example of a broken promise.There are other aspects of this deal which deserve closer attention.  Mr. Rudden is often quoted in the media as being a waste expert who favours incineration.  I mentioned the payment of €25 million before a single brick is laid.It is also important to address the claim of legal problems as this is an excuse local representatives will use mostly to justify their support for the Bill.  On Committee Stage the Minister made the entirely disingenuous claim that because of legal constraints, he had no option other than to remove section 7 which provided for the incineration levy.  He claimed that was because it was incompatible with the revised waste framework directive which came into force early this year.  However, if there was an incompatibility, it would set a higher level than the incineration levy.  Similarly, a levy on incinerators that qualify as recovery facilities can be set at a lower level than that for incinerators classed as disposal facilities.  These are simple matters to address and it is clear the Minister's decision to scrap the levy is not down to any legal difficulties.  The Irish Waste Management Association is in favour of levies and against the Poolbeg incinerator.  While the industry is crying out for a financial instrument to encourage recycling, the Minister is ignoring it in favour of giving the green light to a facility that nobody wants other than Dublin City Council.  It is important that we raise these issues.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this very important legislation.  I hope the Minister will respond to some of the key points I raised.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I want to clarify a few points with the Minister so we will be clear on what is happening.  Given the proposed changes in respect of placenames, will it be the case, based on the Minister's legal advice, that a town that wants to change its name, be to Dingle, Daingean or Daingean Uí Chúis, for example, can do so without recourse to the Minister?I understand from the amendments that have been made that all moneys collected through road tax will now be used for local, county, regional and national routes and public transport infrastructure.  Is this the case?On an earlier Stage, I referred to the packaging and labelling of fuel for sale.  I do not see any amendment in this regard.  Has anything been done thus far to exempt firewood and peat?I have an amendment on incineration that I understand I will have an opportunity to discuss on Report Stage.  I will not reiterate everything said by the previous Deputy; suffice it to say we are very concerned about the Poolbeg incinerator, particularly the terms of the contract.  From speaking to members of Dublin City Council — Deputy Kevin Humphreys is a former Dublin city councillor — I have learned that none has seen a copy of the contract.  Previous speakers stated nobody wants the incinerator only Dublin City Council but I regard the council as its 52 members.  That they have not been party to the decision is very unfortunate.The major concern is that, as the volume of waste is reduced over time, as I hope will be the case, there will not be enough waste to fill the hungry beast that is the incinerator.  The recession has already resulted in a reduction.  Given that we do not know the terms of the contract, will the taxpayer be held liable for any shortfall or loss to the private company running the incinerator?  Will the Minister address these questions?

Caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir an chonspóid áirithe iontas orm ón tús.  Bhí sé amaideach ón chéad lá aon athrú a dhéanamh ins an slí ina hainmníodh Daingean Uí Chúis.  Ariamh ó mo chuimhne féin bhí an t-ainm Béarla agus an t-ainm Gaoluinne á úsáid againn i gCorca Dhuibhne.  Glaomísne Dingle agus Daingean Uí Chúis ar an mbaile agus ní raibh fadhb ar bith faoi sin.  Ar na comharthaí bóthair mórthimpeall an cheantair, bhí an Béarla agus an Ghaoluinn luaite.  Ar ndóigh, nuair a hathraíodh an dlí agus an Daingean amháin a chur isteach, níor chuir sé ionadh ar bith orm go raibh trioblóid faoi.Is baile turasóireachta é Daingean Uí Chúis.  Mar is eol dúinn, tagann cuairteoirí ó chian is ó chóngar de bharr áilleacht na háite.  Cuimhnímis go seasann Daingean Uí Chúis mar gheata go dtí iarthar Chorcha Dhuibhne, go dtí an Ghaeltacht féin, go dtí an chósta agus na cnoic agus go dtí an áilleacht ins an nGaeltacht.  Tá sé mar gheata chuig Dún Chaoin ina bhfuil na báid ag dul amach go dtí na Blascaodaí.  Tagann na mílte duine ó mhórthimpeall an domhain go dtí an Daingean agus a chomharsanacht agus tá na céadta de lucht oibre na háite ag brath ar an turasóireacht agus ar na cuaiteoirí úd.Bhí sé míréasúnta amach is amach dlí a leagadh síos nach bhféadfaí Dingle a chur ar na comharthaí bóthair.  Ní dhearna sé aon chiall ar bith.  Is tír dátheangach an tír seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé dátheangach ariamh.Cé gurb é an Béarla teanga labhartha an tromlaigh tá sé an-thábhachtach go mbeadh an Ghaoluinn mar theanga láidir, chomh maith leis an gcultúr agus gach a bhaineann leis.  Níl aon dabht ach go bhfuil brú ar an nGaoluinn agus ar an nGaeltacht.  Tá an géarchéim eacnamaíochta ag cur an-bhrú orainn i láthair na huaire, le daoine óga á mbrú amach as a gcomharsanacht féin mar nach bhfuil aon obair ann dóibh.  Dá bhrí sin tá brú ar an teanga agus ar an gcultúr, gan trácht ar an mbrú atá ag teacht ó na meáin agus ó fhórsaí eile.Tá sé tábhachtach an Ghaoluinn a caomhnú ach ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh le héigeandáil.  Dá bhrí sin, is socrú ciallmhar é seo a theastaigh ó fhormhór mór mhuintir na háite.  Nuair a bhí an vóta acu bhí tromlach ollmhór ag lorg go mbeadh an dá ainm traidisiúnta ar an mbaile.  Dá bhrí sin, níl anseo ach an rud ceart agus caoi a dhéanamh.Ba mhaith liom ceist a cur ar an Aire mar gheall ar an phróiséas anois.  Cad a tharlóidh tar éis an lae inniu maidir leis an gcinneadh seo a chur i bhfeidhm?  Cén saghas fráma nó próiséas ama atá i gceist?  Caithfidh mé imeacht go dtí cruinniú sular labhróidh an t-Aire ach ba mhaith liom go mbeadh soiléireacht ag muintir Chorcha Dhuibhne agus an Daingin cén saghas ama atá i gceist maidir leis an rud seo a chríochnú agus na comharthaí bóthair a chur thar n-ais mar is caoi sa chomharsanacht.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Can I put it on record how unsatisfactory it is to be debating this motion today?  We received the motion this morning and were looking for it all day yesterday.  We are being asked to take at face value some of the proposals contained therein.  There was certainly not enough time to examine the issues in detail.  I would like to have had the opportunity today to discuss the conflict that might arise between the Official Languages Act and the new section 19, for example, but I do not feel I have time.  Although our job is to hold the Government to account, we are not allowed to do so by virtue of the way business such as this is being handled.  It is most unsatisfactory.  I do not doubt the exact same points would have been made by the Minister if he were on this side of the House.  It is not acceptable.I have a question on the changes proposed to the Official Languages Act.  We can all point to conflicts in our constituencies.  The local authority in Naas uses An Nás whereas Nás an Ríogh is widely used.  There are differences in name signs.  I hope the Minister will respond to this and that a petition system will be properly provided for to rationalise this.  I also hope there will not be a conflict between this and the Official Languages Act.Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan made the point that he cannot participate in this debate because he is attending a meeting of the committee with responsibility for health.  He had a conflict between Roscommon County Hospital and bogs.  He wanted to attend this debate and make that point.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I am not sure what is being provided for with regard to the Local Government Act 1998 and the local government fund.  As the Minister stated, the local government fund comprises motor tax and a contribution from the central Exchequer to local authorities.  I have never felt it has been fairly apportioned because some counties, including mine, are net contributors.  We know the local government fund is likely to be impacted by the EU IMF proposal to introduce several new charges.  When the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 introduced water charges, the battle was fought at local authority level.  There was war over it at the time and I predict the same will happen in this case.It is not at all clear whether motor tax will continue to be ring fenced as a fund for local authorities albeit administered through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Will the Department directly administer it or will it be handed over to the National Roads Authority?  Will the National Roads Authority allocate national, regional and local road funding?  It is a very difficult organisation from which to receive an answer.  If we are to hold the Government to account and ensure the correct balance between funding of national and local roads we must be certain we can do so.  If the administration of this is outsourced to the National Roads Authority it will be very unsatisfactory.I tabled a number of amendments which were ruled out of order.  In a 2002 decision, the European Court of Justice argued against the €20 charge to make a planning objection.  My amendment was ruled out of order because it would lead to a charge on the State.  However, what was really a charge on the State was the out-of-control rezoning of land that produced the property bubble and the building frenzy in places where building should not have taken place.  Those of us who constantly monitored and sought a strategic approach to development in the country were penalised and considered the "anti-brigade". We were constantly criticised and treated as though the last person to leave should switch off the lights.  However, the record of what some of us stated at that time show that if we had been listened to the country may not have ended up in the position in which it now is.  I do not believe citizens who monitor what happens in our planning system should be penalised.  When one considers the administration involved, the charge brings in very little.I also sought a notice to be published after five years of a ten year planning permission to invite comments from people and to deal with significant new information.  It would allow people keep track of the planning system.  I am disappointed it could not be accommodated.  Such oversight may save the State money by ensuring bonds are fully in place and by keeping local authorities on their toes.I also sought an amendment to allow the levy system to introduce a national waiver scheme.  I accept there is little we can do about competition in the waste market.  However recognition should be given to the fact that the only customers local authorities now have are waiver customers.  Local authorities are being run out of the business but then being asked to pick up rubbish from ditches.  We must find mechanisms to deal with this.  Again, my amendment was ruled out of order because it would incur a charge on the State.  However, there already is a charge on the State as it picks up rubbish out of ditches and off boreens.  Private operators are not asked to do this.  This might be considered at some point in the future and the levy might be an appropriate means of doing it.On Committee Stage, I spoke about the incinerator with the Minister.  The numbers on this do not add up.  I do not care whether Dublin City Council, Kildare County Council or Cork City Council is involved but the public purse will be affected by building an incinerator with a capacity of 580,000 tonnes where local authorities are required to produce 320,000 tonnes or incur a charge but have control of less than 80%, and this percentage will reduce.  I have a major problem with the public purse being affected in this way and with the lack of oversight in the contract.  It is not good enough to state that it is a private contract between Dublin City Council and Covanta.  The local authority is a public authority and a failure at this level may lead to a call on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to produce funds to cover it.  The levy system will come into play.I have major concerns about how we are dealing with some of these issues as it is very late in the day.  I am also concerned about the lack of oversight and I find it very unsatisfactory.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I thank Deputies for their contributions and I will deal with some of the points.  Other points will be raised as amendments during the course of the debate.  Deputy Niall Collins spoke about hospital infrastructure, and rightly pointed out projects involving 100 or more beds will have to go to the board.  Smaller projects will go through the normal planning process.  He also raised the definition of "sufficient interest" and this is the level of interest which applicants must have in a case for all other judicial review cases.  This amendment means the planning code will have the same requirements as the Aarhus convention.It is a less onerous requirement for individuals who seek a judicial review of planning decisions if they are approved.  We are not doing anything on sterilisation.  It is just a matter for the planning authorities as is normal to implement the rural planning guidelines and no change is suggested.Deputies Catherine Murphy and Stanley asked about place name provisions.  The new provisions I am introducing will devolve full responsibility for this issue to local authorities.

As stated motor tax and an Exchequer contribution are paid into the local government fund.  The fund in the main funds the general purpose needs of local government through the general purpose grant allocations I make to individual local authorities.  I also make an allocation to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to fund non-national roads.  The amendment will now allow the Minister to expend the allocation on all roads and not just local roads or non-national roads and on public transport infrastructure generally.  I remind the Deputy that the NRA is already administering the funds on behalf of the Department to the local authorities.  The Deputies may not have known that.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I do not necessarily agree with the fact that it does, I just mention it.  I will continue to provide significant general purpose grants to local authorities.  It is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to decide how he will allocate his funds.  Amendments I am introducing today to give effect to the Aarhus convention will allow considerably more participation, openness and transparency in planning and other matters pertaining to local government.  I am sure the Deputies welcome that.  Ireland is the only country in the European Union that had not signed up to the Aarhus convention and these amendments will ensure that we do.On the local government fund, under a protocol arrangement between my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport an annual allocation is made to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will decide how he will allocate that.  The amendment will allow the payment from the local government fund to be spread around various other road categories.  Those were the principal issues mentioned.Deputy Catherine Murphy spoke about waste to recovery.  If she is against waste to recovery she is against EU law.  In addition if she is against waste to recovery, she is in favour of landfill.  I would have thought she would have had enough landfill developments in her constituency and would not want any more.  She is asking me to ignore waste to recovery and she wants more landfill to ensure that she has more difficulties for her local communities in Naas, Kerdiffstown and everywhere else.  She wants the taxpayer to pick up the tab if we are in breach of the EU landfill directive in 2013.  If that is what she wants at least she is honest about it, but I am trying to ensure that the taxpayers and her constituents in Kildare North by this process will engage more in waste to recovery rather than in landfill.

However, if an applicant is granted the relief sought or if the defendant or respondent, as the case may be, is found to have breached a provision of environmental law, the applicant may have all or some of his costs paid by the respondent or defendant as appropriate.  If the case involves notice parties, they may also be required to contribute to the applicant's costs if the court considers it appropriate.  The Judiciary will also retain the discretion to award costs against a party if the court considers the case to be frivolous or vexatious or in favour of a party in a matter of exceptional public importance.

It includes proceedings concerning breaches of certain environmental licences and other consents where the breach has caused, is causing or is likely to cause damage to the environment.  Furthermore the amendment sets out the elements of the environment that would fall under its scope in terms of damage, including air, water, biodiversity, and human health and safety.  The amendment also clarifies that the new costs rule does not extend to cases where personal damages are sought.  The purpose of the amendment is to enhance environmental protection by improving access to justice in existing environmental cases by removing the risk for the applicant or plaintiff having to pay costs for all parties to the proceedings if they are unsuccessful.

In page 4, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:"3.—Section 12(1) of the Act of 1987 is amended--(a) in paragraph (a) by substituting--(i) "€8,000" for "£1,000" in both places where it occurs, and(ii) "€800" for "£100",and(b) in paragraph (b) by substituting--(i) "€800,000" for "£10,000", and(ii) "€8,000" for "£1,000".While we welcome the proposed changes to the fines, there must be a significant penalty for causing air pollution, particularly where companies are concerned.  Part of the Golden Vale, the best land in the country, was polluted and an unfortunate farmer who had lost everything, perhaps even his health, spent many years seeking redress.  Pollution is an important issue in the context of food production.  Now that agriculture has again taken centre stage, we need strict and rigorous laws to deal with pollution.  That is the reason we have tabled the amendment.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I thank the Deputy for his interest in this matter.  The amendment proposes that the monetary amounts of fines or penalties under the Air Pollution Act be further increased beyond the significant amounts for which I am providing.  Paragraph (a) refers to fines on summary conviction and proposes that a larger increase than that proposed by the Government be introduced.  This is unnecessary, as I am proposing to align the amounts within the bands provided for by the Fines Act 2010, allowing them to be updated centrally to ensure they remain effective.  The Fines Act introduced a new system of categorised bands of fines for minor offences, that is, on summary conviction.  This system came into operation on 4 January this year.  The maximum amounts are €5,000, €4,000, €2,500, €1,000 and €500 for class A, B, C, D and E offences, respectively.  This system is more practical, as the amounts can be periodically changed by the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure they retain their monetary value and consequent deterrent power.  Any change made would apply to all relevant legislation without the necessity of amending individual pieces of legislation and instruments.  Furthermore, categorising fines provides for a more consistent penalty system for all environmental law.  It is best practice that all new legislation covering minor offences categorise fines in accordance with the bands set in the Fines Act.  As I propose to update the fines for offences under the Air Pollution Act in line with the bands applying under the Fines Act, I cannot accept the amendment.Paragraph (b) refers to fines on conviction on indictment and proposes that a larger increase than the one proposed by the Government be introduced, €800,000 rather than €500,000, with a proportionate increase in the daily fine for a continuing offence to €8,000 rather than €5,000.  The proposed increase from £10,000 to €500,000 has been selected to ensure consistency with comparable amounts in other environmental legislative measures.  This aims to provide a more consistent penalty system throughout our environmental legislation framework and the maximum fine permitted for a conviction on indictment in legislation transposing EU directives is €500,000, as provided under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972.  Introducing this level of fine to the Air Pollution Act will bring it into line with the monetary penalties in other key environmental legislative measures that originated as EU directives, for example, waste and groundwater regulations.  The proposed increase is substantial to reflect the fact that the current fine amount of £10,000 was set in 1987 and has lost significant value and its deterrent effect.  The proposed increase will be effective and proportionate and will have the necessary deterrent effect to support the enforcement of the Air Pollution Act.  Therefore, the proposed amendment cannot be accepted.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	343	On the basis of the Minister's statement that he will be able to increase the fines periodically, I will withdraw my amendment.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 4, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:"3.--For the purposes of clarity, the offences regarding sealing and labelling of fuel bags as set out in the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 118/1998), and Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations 2011(S.I. 270/2011) shall not include domestic sale of firewood, turf and peat.".I highlighted a problem with the Bill on Second and Committee Stages.  Like the Government parties, we want the labelling and sealing of bags of solid fuel to be regulated in order that smokeless fuels are used in smokeless zones.  Customers should not be able erroneously to buy smoky fuel because it has been labelled "smokeless".  There must be labelling of anthracite coal and fossil fuels of that type.  The Minister will understand the problem, as I have explained it twice.  Outside the Pale, in particular, it is and will remain common practice for firewood and peat to be sold in open, unlabelled 10:10:20 bags.  The Minister will understand what the label means.  It is like the 10:10:20 fertiliser bags.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Yes.  It is not necessary to label or seal these bags because customers in the fuel depot can recognise whether the contents are firewood or ordinary peat or, as it is called down the country, turf.  However, we support the labelling and sealing of bags of smokeless and other fuels such as ordinary and anthracite coal that might look like smokeless fuel.  Will the Minister accept my amendment on this basis?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The amendment proposes to insert a new provision regarding the sealing and labelling requirements of fuel bags under the fuel regulations.  The Air Pollution Act 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 require that a person or body shall not place on the market, sell or distribute bituminous coal in a bag unless it is sealed.  Bituminous coal is defined in the regulations as coal "falling within CN Code 2701 12 placed on the market for residential heating" and does not require further clarification.  Accepting this amendment could create confusion where there is none.  The sealing and labelling provisions relate to bituminous coal, not to timber or peat.  However, I will seek clarification for the Deputy in that regard.The smoky coal ban was introduced in Dublin in 1990 and has since been extended to other cities and large towns.  It has proved effective in improving air quality in urban areas and I intend to undertake a public consultation process on the ban during the coming months to ensure its continued effectiveness.  Issues such as bagging and labelling requirements will be explored as part of that consultation.  If there is any doubt about the Deputy's suggestion, I will use the consultation process as an opportunity to ensure the sentiment of what he is seeking to do is expressed in the regulations.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The Minister has claimed my amendment would cause confusion, but he is not being clear.  We all know that ordinary coal, including anthracite, can be substituted by someone selling bags off the back of a lorry to people who mistakenly believe it is smokeless fuel.  If the Minister is proposing a change in this respect, that is fine, but he is not being clear on the question of whether this provision will exempt firewood and peat.  If he obtains clarification and it does, I will happily withdraw the amendment.The Minister mentioned that he might be able to make the necessary changes in subsequent regulations.  If that is his legal advice, I am happy to accept it.  However, we must not create a problem in the sale of domestic fuel in 23 or 24 counties, which is what this provision will do.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I admire the Deputy's detailed knowledge of these matters.  Regulation 4 of Statutory Instrument 118 of 1998 requires bags of fuel to be sealed.  There is no compulsion to only sell in bags; it is aimed at coal.  Peat is usually sold in briquettes.  Peat and wood have a lower sulphur content than coal so peat, which typically has a sulphur content of 0.4%, and based on the Air Pollution Acts and their sulphur content, wood and peat are exempt from these regulations but they are apply to coal.

The amendment proposes that in cases where an authorised person is obstructed or reasonably expects to be met with obstruction, he or she may be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.

In page 6, to delete lines 6 to 9 and substitute the following:""(3) The amount of the levy shall be specified in the regulations under subsection (2) but shall not exceed an amount of 26 cent for each plastic bag supplied to a customer.".The plastic bag levy was a great success.  It is not long ago that every hedgerow in the country was decorated with plastic bags.  We propose that the amount allowed for in the legislation be reduced.  There will be a 70 cent charge on plastic bags.  That is too high.  At the moment the charge is 15 cent and it works reasonably well.  We agree with the Minister that it should be increased.  Perhaps it should be index linked because it has been 15 cent since its introduction a decade ago.  We feel 26 cent for each bag would be sufficient but 70 cent is very high.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Amendment No. 13 proposes the ceiling on the plastic bag levy should be retained at 26 cent.  The Bill gives me the opportunity over a long period of time to increase the plastic bag levy but I cannot do it by any more than 10% of the existing levy in any financial year plus the change in the consumer price index since the last change, up to a limit of 70 cent.  It will take a considerable number of years if we increase it every year and it is not my intention to do that.A ceiling of 26 cent would not give me the flexibility to replenish the environment fund or deal with environmental matters in a serious way when additional resources are needed to deal with problems such as remediation in landfill sites in Deputy Catherine Murphy's constituency and in other constituencies.  I need the flexibility.  I will not say by how much or how often I will need to increase the charge but I want to give myself up to a maximum levy of 70 cent in this case.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 8, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:"7.—(1) The practice of incineration or thermal treatment of waste shall no longer be legal within this state.(2) Sections 4 and 5 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 are repealed.(3) The making of a waste management plan shall be a reserved function of the local authority.".This is an important issue.  Our approach to waste management should be based on the community and on environmental sustainability.  I fully acknowledge that Ireland faces a waste management crisis.  This is a global problem, it is not unique to this State, but we have an opportunity to make the right decisions for Ireland by supporting the amendment.When we tackle the waste crisis we must also tackle the causes of the problem.  We cannot continue to produce waste, burn it and hope the problem will go away.  Building mass burning incinerators similar to that proposed for the Poolbeg peninsula is far from the solution.  A closer look at the incinerator will show that incinerators are part of the problem.  The incinerator proposed for the Poolbeg peninsula has the capacity to burn more waste than the city of Dublin can produce.  The choice for Covanta, the operator, is to import waste or to encourage Government policies that produce waste and, therefore, more rubbish to burn and more profit for the owners.  The lack of waste is a huge concern.  The volumes of waste being produced by industry and wholesalers will significantly reduce in coming years.  Sinn Féin wants to set a target of zero waste and to work towards that.The history of the contract is little short of a scandal.  Dublin city councillors have not been party to decisions and have not seen important documentation.  That leaves much to be desired.  In another time there would have been a huge outcry and there is no reason that should not happen now.The EU directives rightly restrict our landfill options.  To turn to burning waste is not a solution.  We need to adopt a zero waste strategy similar to some of the municipalities in New Zealand.  We must drastically reduce the waste we produce by reducing packaging at source.  We must reduce and reuse products and reintroduce glass recycling.  That the State has no glass recycling facility is a damning indictment of our failed waste management policies.  We must also invest in our fledging recycling industry.  If the millions used to fund the huge PR operation to promote incineration were used to promote and invest in recycling, the industry would be much stronger today and we have more jobs from the recycling of waste.We have set a target for Food Harvest 2020.  Agriculture was not seen as important during the boom but we now understand its importance, the importance of food exports and the clean image of food from Ireland.  Incineration can do real damage to the food chain and will cause damage to the perception of Irish food, which could have huge economic consequences.The amendment would allow us to pursue a waste management strategy based on reducing, reusing and recycling.    This is an opportunity to right the wrongs of failed government policies since 1999 when incineration was the cornerstone of waste management strategy.  Communities can be assured that if this amendment fails to receive the required support, Sinn Féin will continue to work with campaigning groups to ensure that this State is incineration-free in future.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I do not intend to go over the arguments I made on Committee Stage.  I still firmly believe that section 7 should have stayed in the Bill.  It has now been removed but that will prove to be a mistake.I welcome the amendments and the spirit in which they have been tabled.  We need to shine a bright light on the contracts done between Dublin City Council and Covanta.  It is unfortunate that the former Minister, Mr. Dick Roche, approved it and signed those documents.  The matter has not been dealt with adequately until now.My constituency has had one of the largest landfills in the city on Sandymount Strand.  We went through that period, but the solution to our waste problems is not necessarily to be found through burning it or using landfill sites.  The Minister should give a clear commitment to impose a levy on waste and excess packaging at source.  He should seriously examine the possibility of introducing a Bill to achieve that as quickly as possible.If there is no levy on incineration, we will shift the focus from landfill to incineration and will draw down other recyclable materials to incineration.  I welcomed the Minister's remarks on Committee Stage when he said he would quickly introduce a consultative document to examine a mechanism to rebalance the issue and possibly bring levies to bear on incineration.  I look forward to that consultation process and will contribute to it at that stage.As other Deputies have said, one of the biggest problems with an incinerator on the Poolbeg peninsula is that it will be too big.  It is also broadly accepted that it is the wrong location.  We need to fundamentally reform local government, giving power to elected councillors rather than officials.  The 52 councillors on Dublin City Council, of which I was one, always opposed the incinerator but we could never see the contract or the Hennessy report in full.  We must examine mechanisms whereby public representatives can review such contracts properly and see completed reports.  In his review, I ask the Minister to move that power back to local government.I notice that Deputy Finian McGrath left the Chamber after making his contribution.  He quoted many sources, but I would remind him that he kept the two previous governments in power.  If it was such a big problem for him, he could have made it an issue at any stage.  However, I note that Deputy Finian McGrath prefers to make his contributions and then run, so as not to hear a counter argument.The Minister should re-examine imposing a levy on incineration, in addition to introducing a levy on excess packaging as quickly as possible.  That is the way to reduce the volume that must go either to landfill or incineration.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I made some points earlier in the debate and made the same ones on Committee Stage, so I will not go over them again.  I endorse Deputy Humphreys' point on the rebalancing and transfer of powers between reserve functions and the local government executive.  Officials are not elected and will not be held to account, which is a major deficit in our democracy.Kildare is not short of landfill sites, as the Minister is well aware.  The Kill landfill site has taken most of Dublin's waste over the years.  We now have Droighead, which is the biggest landfill site in the country, and is owned and controlled by Bord na Móna.  We have a great deal of experience with landfill, but it is not something that people tend to want on their doorsteps.  The way in which we deal with residual waste is incredibly important.  We have seen what has happened in the private sector, as the Minister said, concerning Kerdiffstown.  That was a failure of the private sector and of the Environmental Protection Agency or EPA.  There is a deficiency concerning the EPA in that it did not have the legal power to close that site down.  It will cost the State millions to remedy that.  The EPA is doing a good remedial job there at the moment and let us hope that continues.  It will require Exchequer resources to continue to do so, but we must also find the point where that failure occurred.On Committee Stage, the Minister said that what was proposed by Covanta was in the recovery tier.  We have all seen that people will go to the trouble of using the bottle bank as well as segregating their waste into various bins.  We will take the advantage away from segregation, however, by having such a large facility.  We will therefore kill off the recovery tier where we should segregate waste for reuse and recycling.  I have a serious problem in this regard and I would oppose the Bill for this aspect alone.  Section 7 would at least have provided some sort of counterbalance to a levying system.  I have a serious problem with the fact that there is an economic mismatch there also.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I endorse much of what Deputy Kevin Humphreys has already said, particularly with regard to the levy on excess packaging which is important.  We can be quite progressive in that regard if we so choose.  I will confine my remarks to the possibility of a levy on incineration.  I have spoken before, as many others did, about the importance of having that levy.  If we want to avoid over-reliance on incineration and have a proper balance in the waste management matrix, there must be levies on incineration.  I take the Minister's point that at the moment such levies may be premature because the market has not established itself.  We may need to wait for that to happen before we can bring in levies, which are essential.  I would welcome any commitment from the Minister to examine the possibility of introducing levies at a future date.  The Minister should have such powers in his armoury as we consider how to improve waste management.  The Minister must have the ability to impose a levy at some future date when he feels the market is established and it is then necessary to move waste management mechanisms further up the hierarchy.I welcome the Bill and support the Minister in his endeavours.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I propose to deal with the three parts of amendment No. 14 in turn.  The first part of this amendment proposes to make illegal within the State a form of waste management which is legal under EU law.  Incineration, where it reaches the required threshold for energy recovery, is deemed to be on the recovery tier of the waste hierarchy — a priority order established by the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC.  I transposed this directive into national legislation on 31 March this year.  Landfill, which is classed as disposal and below the recovery tier, would remain legal under this amendment.  Therefore, this amendment would be contrary to the directive.  We have an immediate challenge in moving away from over-dependence on landfill.  We will need a range of alternative infrastructure and will need to put in place a number of measures, including waste prevention, to meet this challenge.  To make one of those options illegal would result in increased costs to the public and business, and undermine our ability to provide alternatives to landfill.The second part of this amendment proposes to repeal two sections of the Waste Management Acts dealing with waste management planning.  Deputies will be aware that it was previously found necessary to provide for city and county managers to make waste management plans as an executive function.  The reason for that was that councillors did not make the decision.  I assure the House that I will examine the issue of waste management planning as part of the development of a new waste policy, which I intend to conclude by the end of this year.  I will also examine the issue of devolution of functions back to the councillors in the context of a local government review.The third part of the amendment proposes to restore responsibility for the making of waste management plans to the members of local authorities.  As I indicated, I will examine this issue at the appropriate time as part of local government reform in respect of the role elected members will play in adopting waste management plans.My primary aim in the development of a new waste policy is to ensure Ireland meets its obligations under EU law.  If I am to be characterised as being in favour of anything in so far as waste policy is concerned, I am in favour of moving away from an over-reliance on the least desirable waste management option of landfill towards approaches higher up in the waste hierarchy.  Whatever way we look at this, there is no escaping the stark reality that the most pressing challenge in waste management is to achieve compliance with the limits set in Directive 1999/31/EC in respect of the volumes of waste which can be sent to landfill.  The next targets are to be achieved by 2013 and 2016.  The EPA warned us in its 2009 national waste report that we did not have a hope of meeting these targets if we did not make quick decisions on our waste infrastructure.  Therefore, we need to address the alternatives to landfill.With the opening of Ireland's first municipal waste to energy project later this year, it is clear that incineration will play some part in diverting waste away from landfill.  However, a range of other measures will be even more important in the development of a sustainable waste policy.  The national waste prevention programme will continue to support businesses and the public in reducing the amount of waste produced, saving them money in the process.  The further roll-out of segregated waste collection services will also help to ensure the diversion of waste from landfill to more productive uses such as composting and anaerobic digestion.  Therefore, it is not a question of being in favour of incineration but of meeting our obligations.There is nothing in the waste framework directive that precludes the introduction of a levy on incineration.  However, it does preclude one such as that proposed in the original section 7 of the Bill.  The reason I have had to take the route I have taken on section 7 is to ensure the section of the Bill developed by the previous Government will be based on an approach that levies should not be changed in a way to give incineration an economic advantage over landfill.The programme for Government commits to the introduction of a sustainable waste policy which adheres to the waste hierarchy.  In the coming weeks I will publish a discussion document for public consultation to inform the finalisation of a new waste policy.  The appropriate use of economic instruments such as levies will be considered as part of that process.  I am telling Deputies Humprhreys and Eoghan Murphy that I will be considering the introduction of waste levies in the future in the context of waste policy as they apply to incineration.Both Deputies mentioned the possibility of having a levy on packaging.  There is a consultation process under way and submissions must be received by 5 August.  If they wish to raise this issue, it might be appropriate to make a submission and their views could be considered as part of that process before I come to conclusions.  I encourage them to do so.I have no role in the contract between Dublin City Council and Covanta on the project before us.  All I can do is outline waste policy.  This dates back to 2001 when the taxpayer provided €7.5 million for Dublin City Council for the appointment of its clients' representative in respect of the proposal at Poolbeg.  An application for recoupment of funding for the project was made to the European Commission in 2000 as part of a group of projects entitled, Dublin Region Solid Waste Management Infrastructures — Stage 1.  However, no assistance was sought or granted in respect of the actual construction or operation of the facility.  The issue of potential liabilities is a matter for the parties to the contract and purely speculative at this point.I have listened to Deputies talk about the huge exposure of the taxpayer arising from the fact that Dublin City Council and the waste authorities in the region will not be able to supply the necessary amount of waste to this facility, if constructed.  That indicates to me that they have seen the contract.  I have not seen it and I do not know who has, but Deputy Stanley seems to know much more than I do about the exposure of the taxpayer.  Deputy Murphy seems to know more about it also.  We have a sufficient amount of municipal waste that must be dealt with under the waste policy higher up in the waste hierarchy in order to divert it away from landfill.  As there is more than an adequate amount of material available, I do not know what the scaremongering is about when the Deputies talk about the exposure of the taxpayer when the requirement to have in excess of 320,000 tonnes available for such a facility is capable of being met.  Mr. John Hennessy, senior counsel, examined various scenarios and the taxpayer will be exposed to a figure of up to €357 million if we do not proceed with the project, or if the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government had anything to do with trying to stop it owing to the contracts signed by the US firm Covanta and Dublin City Council.  I am not going to tamper with a contract and thus expose the taxpayer to that amount of money.  If we want to stop the project through interfering with the contract, we will be exposing the taxpayer to a figure of €357 million.  If we do not want to do anything about diverting waste away from landfill, we will face European Commission fines in 2013.  Is that what we want?  If it is, the Deputies should tell us how we would pay for this.  I am not prepared to pursue a waste policy that will result in taxpayers paying more money in fines to the European Commission, or to break a contract and expose us to potential fines.I am satisfied that the waste hierarchy on which I have signed off is sufficiently robust and that the new waste policy I will bring forward later this year will take account of the concerns of the Deputies in reducing, reusing and recycling waste material and minimising the exposure of the taxpayer.  It will also be more environmentally friendly if we divert waste from landfill sites which nobody wants in his or her constituency.

Daingean Uí Chúis and, in the English language, as Dingle.(2) The Order of 2004 is amended by the deletion—(a) of the text in columns (1) and (2) of Caibidil 1 of Roinn A of Cuid 4 at reference number 171,(b) of the text in columns (1) and (2) of Caibidil 2 of Roinn A of Cuid 4 at reference number 4, and(c) of the text in columns (1) and (2) of Caibidil 4 of Roinn A of Cuid 4 at reference number 11.(3) In this section ‘Order of 2004' means the An t-Ordú Logainmneacha (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) 2004 (S.I. No. 872 of 2004).192.—(1) The consideration of submissions received under this Part shall be a reserved function.(2) A local authority shall, in adopting a proposal under section 189 or 190 have regard to local traditions.(3) (a) If a majority of the votes cast at a ballot held pursuant to a decision under subsection (7) of section 189 or subsection (7) of section 190 in relation to a place in a Gaeltacht area is in favour of the proposed new placename concerned, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs shall make an order declaring that, from such date (determined in accordance with paragraph (b)) as is specified in the order, that proposed new placename shall become and be the placename in respect of the place concerned.(b) Where the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs makes an order under this subsection, the placename to which the declaration in the order relates shall—(i) if the order is made not less than 3 months before the 1st day of January next following the order, become and be the placename of the place concerned from the said 1st day of January, or(ii) in any other case, become and be the placename of the place concerned from the first anniversary of the said 1st day of January.(c) Every order under this subsection shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House sits after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.(4) Where the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs makes an order under subsection (3), any provision of an order made under section 32 of the Official Languages Act 2003 in force immediately before the making of the first-mentioned order shall stand revoked in so far only as it conflicts with the firstmentioned order.(5) (a) The Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this Part.(b) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (a), regulations under that paragraph may make provision in relation to the bearing of the costs incurred by local authorities in the performance of their functions under section 190 or as a consequence of the substitution of a placename under that section.(6) In this section ‘Gaeltacht area' has the same meaning as it has in the Official Languages Act 2003.193.—A local authority may cause the placename of a street or other place to be displayed on a conspicuous part of any building, structure or land located on that street or at that place.194.—(1) Where a declaration under section 189 or 190 is made in respect of a place—(a) references in any enactment, instrument or other document to the placename of that place applicable immediately before the date specified in the declaration in accordance with subsection (9) of section 189 or subsection (9) of section 190, as the case may be, shall, from that date, be construed as references to the placename specified in that declaration, and(b) references in any proceedings (civil or criminal) pending immediately before that date to the placename firstmentioned in paragraph (a) shall, from that date, be construed as references to the placename secondmentioned in that paragraph.(2) Where an order under section 192 is made in respect of a place—(a) references in any enactment, instrument or other document to the placename of that place applicable immediately before the date specified in the order in accordance with subsection (3) of that section shall, from that date, be construed as references to the placename specified in that order, and(b) references in any proceedings (civil or criminal) pending immediately before that date to the placename firstmentioned in paragraph (a) shall, from that date, be construed as references to the placename secondmentioned in that paragraph.(3) (a) References in any enactment, instrument or other document to An Daingean shall, from the commencement of section 191, be construed as references to Daingean Uí Chúis.(b) References in any proceedings (civil or criminal) pending immediately before the commencement of section 191 to An Daingean shall, from such commencement, be construed as references to Daingean Uí Chúis.”.”.As I outlined in the debate on the instruction motion, amendment No. 45 substitutes a revised and updated Part 18 for the existing Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001.  The amendment also seeks to resolve the long-running controversy over the name of the town Dingle or An Daingean by providing that the name of the town in the Irish language shall be "Daingean Uí Chúis" and in the English language shall be "Dingle".Amendment No. 46 is related to amendment No. 45.  It updates the reference in section 32 of the Official Languages Act 2003 to the new Part 18 provisions as inserted by amendent No. 45.  With regard to amendment No. 46, section 32 of the Official Languages Act 2003 provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht may issue a placenames order declaring the Irish language version of a placename specified in the order.  Section 32(2) provides that the Minister shall not make such a declaration for a place in the Gaeltacht in respect of which a declaration under Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 is in place.  The amendment proposed to subsection (2) simply updates the reference to the new Part 18 provisions as inserted by the previous amendment.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I welcome amendments Nos. 45 and 46 which will, in effect, restore the bilingual placename of Dingle-Daingean Uí Chúis.  This is a very long-running controversy in west Kerry and there was really no need for it.  It has cost the Exchequer much money but the people of Kerry South, and particularly muintir Chorca Dhuibhne, are very grateful to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for acting so swiftly on this matter to ensure these amendments would be brought before the House.  I hope the bilingual name will be restored.  This has been ongoing for many years and the people of Dingle voted democratically to have the bilingual name of their town back in 2006.  Unfortunately, it has taken this long for it to happen but the people of Dingle are very grateful to the Minister.  I was there on Saturday and met many people in the town.  Most were asking about this issue and were glad to hear that it was progressing.  I thank the people of the town for their persistence in the matter, particularly my colleague, councillor Seámus Cosaí Fitzgerald, who initiated the process of having the plebiscite in Dingle and who has driven this issue over recent years.  He has given much time and effort to the matter.It will have a practical effect.  As a resident of the Dingle Peninsula I have met many tourists seeking directions to Dingle because the name has been removed from signposts in Kerry.  At least the name of Dingle will return to signposts, which is a very welcome measure.  The town is a world-renowned brand name, but unfortunately when tourists see "An Daingean" on a signpost, they do not know it refers to Dingle.  The name will be on maps and signposts, which is very important for the local tourist industry which needs every bit of help now.This is a victory for democracy and the people who spoke at the ballot box a number of years ago are finally having their wishes recognised and implemented by the Government.  I welcome that.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, which are being discussed together relate to section 13 of the Bill.  They were brought forward by me in Seanad Éireann last night in accordance with a commitment I gave in Dáil Éireann on Thursday, 14 July on Report Stage.  They amend section 13 which amends section 26 of the Child Care Act 1991 and take cognisance of the amendment tabled by Deputy Ó Caoláin on Report Stage.  They are also consistent with a proposed amendment tabled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party during the reading of the Bill in the previous Dáil.  Their effect is to take away the discretion of the judge as to whether a guardian ad litem is legally represented and provide that a guardian ad litem may instruct a solicitor and, having regard to the circumstance of the case, counsel.  The effect is to continue the practice for a guardian ad litem to be in a position to appoint legal representatives in care cases, including special care cases.  The judge has discretion in the appointment of a guardian ad litem in proceedings.  I hope the Deputies are in agreement with the amendments.

I welcome the proposed amendments before final conclusion of the passage of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Certainly, Seanad amendment No. 2 mirrors well the wording of amendment No. 13 in my name in the course of our Report Stage deliberations.  I fully appreciate that the key point on the role of a guardian ad litem concerns the wherewithal to appoint and “instruct”.  On the use of the word “instruct”, it is critical that there be independence on the part of the guardian ad litem dealing directly with the interests of the child as against those of the court.  “Instructing” is a word about which there would have been concern.Perhaps the Minister might elaborate a little on Seanad amendment No. 3 and give us, if she can, an example as regards the wording: "The court may, on the application to it of the Health Service Executive, order any other party to the proceedings in question to pay to the Health Service Executive any costs or expenses payable by the Health Service Executive under subsection (2C)".  With everything else with which I am wrestling, I have not been able to translate this into actuality.  If such an example could be given, we would perhaps be in a position to fully appreciate the Minister's intent.  It is perhaps an outworking of Seanad amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  I have no objection to it in principle, but I would like to understand it, as I understand the Minister's intent in Seanad amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and, subsequently, Seanad amendment No. 4.I record my appreciation of the Minister's efforts in recent days on the Bill.  While I remain strongly of the view that the Bill is deficient because it fails to statutorily enshrine the right to after-care, nevertheless I recognise the other advances made within the legislation.

In an hour or two we will finish up for the summer recess.  The Minister has addressed this particular need with considerable alacrity and the speed that it deserved, for which I commend her.  However, I appeal to her, as, I think, my colleague, Deputy McDonald, may have done earlier this morning to utilise the summer recess in order that when we come back in September for the autumn session the long identified needs for legislation in the area of children's rights will have been addressed with specific dates for publication.  This is critically important.  In the current schedule for much of the legislation that focuses on children's rights and needs it is not possible to indicate the notation.  However, I have every confidence in the Minister.  I speak from a point of view which I hope is shared where the intent is to move with all speed to bring forward the necessary legislation to which we all have collectively contributed and for which we have pressed for a long period.  Specifically, I speak about the establishment of the child welfare and protection agency, the children Bill, the children first Bill — the Ryan report implementation Bill — and, of course, the national vetting bureau Bill.  These are absolutely essential in providing for the Children First guidelines in legislation.  I urge the Minister to give a brief response before we conclude.  I hope she will hit the ground running in September in the case of all this legislation, mindful of the terrible backdrop to the conclusion of this Dáil session — the Cloyne report — and the myriad concerns about other issues, including those within the ambit of the State and State agencies.  I am also particularly mindful of the terrible case in Donegal, the full extent of which, perhaps, is not yet realised.

It is important to point out on this Bill that the parties in government have reneged on the commitment given while in opposition to place the provision of after-care on a statutory footing.  Deputy Ó Caoláin re-tabled Fine Gael's amendment, but the new Government voted it down.  It is unfortunate to see such a discrepancy between a party's policy in opposition and in government.We have had a momentous couple of weeks in this brief, with the publication of the Cloyne report and the various issues arising from it.  On the implementation of the report and her plans in respect of mandatory reporting, I urge the Minister to undertake an assessment during the summer period of the resources needed in that regard.  That is of critical importance.  That has been the flaw in what we have seen in the past week.  There will be resource implications and, without the accompanying resources, good intentions may well not be brought into reality.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I thank Deputies for their comments.  I have referred the Donegal case to the HSE group responsible for the review of serious incidents to carry out a review of the circumstances there.  I hope to have a report from the group in the near future.  Certainly, we must understand precisely what happened, if other interventions could have been made and we must analyse exactly the role of the various agencies and people involved.I take the point about the priority child protection legislation should have.  I assure the House that child protection legislation is a high priority for the Government, as evidenced by the establishment of the Department.  It is a sign that we intend to put these issues at the heart of Government.  I have already given a commitment to the House that the wording of the referendum will be available in the autumn term and that we will then proceed with the Bill and the required legislation to ensure that we can hold a referendum in the new year.I thank Deputies for their contribution during the passage of this important Bill.  The main objective of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 is to safeguard the best interests of children in need of special care.  The processes enshrined in the Bill will support the achievement of this outcome.  Special care is a last resort but it is an important part of child care and it meets the express needs of the small number of children in need of such care when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable.  This is a small group of children but we must have high standards and be vigilant with regard to the experience of these children.  This type of care involves complex constitutional matters and it is appropriate that it should continue to be presented to and determined by the High Court.  This approach will allow for a consistent, well-managed structure, presentation and consideration of applications for special care orders.One unique aspect of the Bill includes specific provisions for when a child may be in need of special care services and may be charged or convicted of a criminal offence.  The provisions clarify when the HSE may apply for a special care order or continue to care for a child under such an order.  In summary, where a child is in need of special care, the HSE is in a position to apply to the High Court to allow it to provide that care to the child.  In addition, the care requirements of the child who is the subject of a special care order will be kept under the supervision of the High Court.  This is very important.  The High Court will carry out a review of each four week period for which a special care order has effect.  There is careful monitoring of the use of these special care orders, as there should be.I thank Deputies for their contributions and comments on the priority which child care and child protection and welfare legislation should receive.  I look forward to their support when we present the legislation.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	406	The Bill introduces a framework for the resolution of distressed institutions.  While I welcome some of the provisions, which are long overdue and which could help to ease the burden created by the financial crisis or collapse in 2008, what we really need is a change in culture and political orientation that will prevent credit institutions from ever reaching the stage of catastrophic distress again.We must put several basic questions.  How did the banks destroy the economy?  How was this allowed to happen?  Why were banks allowed to grow to the extent that they posed such a threat to the entire society?  The Bill does nothing to answer these questions or to address the fundamental structural problems in a capitalist system that has allowed the banks to grow to the point where they threatened the foundations of our society.  The Bill has nothing to say about why we should allow financial institutions to hold such vast power over ordinary people.  It says nothing about why the markets in which the banks operate should hold such incredible power.  It says nothing about why ordinary people have no say over these money markets.  It says nothing about the fact that the money markets, as has been demonstrated to dramatic effect in the past three years, are remarkably fragile and reliant on the most fragile of all human traits, that is, confidence.The past 30 years have been marked by a belief that the markets should be treated as some type of untouchable authority.  At times, this belief resembled a kind of religious fanaticism.  The idea that markets could solve all problems and create wealth in a sustainable way from complex, risk-taking behaviours was held in an unquestioning manner.  This religious faith, or what masquerades for it in much the same way as the faith of our religious institutions, has been repaid in the most appalling manner and capitalism has been shown to be a failure in this respect.There is a great difference between money and wealth.  We are aware that a great deal of money was sloshing around but that did not deliver wealth that could be shared.  Were we to learn one thing from the economic catastrophe, which is a catastrophe at societal level, it is that the money markets are not the rational, efficient mechanisms about which we were told.  On the contrary, we are all well aware now that markets are an undemocratic forum for faceless financiers acting out a herd instinct with short-term profit motives.Money markets are the opposite of a rational mechanism for deciding how society's wealth should be created, distributed and controlled.  In the past 30 years we have seen a dramatic increase in the size, power and influence of financial institutions.  When historians write about the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century they will surely describe it as the era of the global financial institution, one that is un-elected, undemocratic and supremely powerful.  How was this allowed to happen?  The issue we are debating today tells us nothing in this regard or about how to address the issue.Another striking feature of the debate on financial institutions in recent years is the question of banks being too big to fail.  What does this really mean?  We have two big banks at the moment and I cannot understand why these banks will not be too big to fail in future because it is argued that they will be our systemic banks.I opposed the Maastricht treaty.  I knocked on doors because I was concerned that the convergence criteria would be an impossibility were we to get into difficulties in future.  I met those who would pay the price for this because they relied on the State for services and income.  I have not had the chance to listen to the radio today but I hope the Minister will give us some positive news from that point of view.  I am sick to death of waking up and listening to Moody's and Standard & Poor's in regard to financial products, including sub-prime products and all the rest, which are not actually products at all.  The Bill deals with a small area but far more is needed in terms of defining the kind of economic system that can support the creation of real wealth and create wealth in such a way that it can be distributed more equally within our society.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I have had more experience with banks than I wanted to have.  I am still dealing with four different banks and have had positive and negative experiences with them.  In my 20 years dealing with them, I never found them easy to deal with but they have moved the goalposts a good bit in the past couple of years and it is a very different world.  While I admit I took risks and they took risks, the attitude they have taken now is very aggressive and it is as if I was the only one who took risks.  The notion that we would work together has very much disappeared because although we worked together for a long time, that is obviously history now and they have taken a different approach.Once upon a time in this country we saw the banks as utilities that worked hand in hand with the people, the State, small and medium size businesses and large businesses — they were definitely seen as utilities.  That came to an end in recent years as the high street bank we knew became partially an investment bank as well.  It appeared as if they were not making the decisions any longer, and the markets and the ratings agencies probably had more sway than those making decisions at grassroots level in the banks in any town or city in the country.There was much talk in 2008 and 2009 about laying down new ground rules for how banks should behave.  One of the areas was of course in regard to bonus schemes.  It was interesting to read this week in the Financial Times that the British banks paid out Stg£14 billion in bonuses last year.  While they make up 14% of the working population of Britain, they paid out 40% of the bonuses, so very little seems to have changed and they seem to have recovered well from the hiccup.  Now that the taxpayers of states all over the planet have come to their rescue, it seems as if it will be business as usual again for the banking institutions.The State must be very strict in how it monitors banking behaviour.  We cannot depend on banks to behave in an ethical fashion or expect them to behave as if they are a utility that will serve the people.  While I have no problem with banks making money, there must be some ethics involved and some sense of responsibility.  When they lend money to people, they cannot just throw them to the wind when it suits them.  Unfortunately, that is what is happening at present.Whether the Government feels it can only do what is being done at an international level, I do not know.  However, it would be great if our country adopted a very strict policy on how banks work.  We know that some countries, such as Canada, had a much tighter hold on banking behaviour than many others.  We can learn something from them.  We have certainly learned that we cannot leave the banks to their own devices to work unfettered.  If the State is going to come to their rescue when problems arise, surely the State has the power to call the shots at all times with the banks.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Yesterday the Taoiseach used the words "dysfunction", "disconnection", "elitism" and "narcissism" about the church.  Those words could equally be applied to our banking institutions.  We cannot but be struck by the fact that at least apologies are coming from certain quarters in the church but there has been a lack of similar apologies from the banking authorities.Once again, we are in a situation we should not be in or at least we should not be in it to the extent we are.  While I accept outside influences did play a significant role, our banking crisis was essentially self-made through the greed of the bank authorities in that they allowed themselves to become over-exposed to property.  There was poor governance, appalling management or mismanagement, not to mention the cosy relationship between the banks and certain individuals.  The Financial Regulator's role was extremely inadequate and the relevant people in authority in this House and in the Department of Finance were not up to the mark, regardless of whether they were misinformed, not informed or chose not to see.  The solution chosen, namely, save the banks at all costs, led to the extensive blanket bank guarantee.The point appears to be that if a systematic resolution framework had been in place we would not now be in the dire straits we are in, or at least not to that extent.  It was borne out in both the Honohan and Nyberg reports that if a resulting mechanism had been in place, public losses would have been reduced.I note the various purposes behind the Bill, including an effective and efficient resolution regime for failing or likely to fail credit institutions, and that the Exchequer will be protected.  I accept we need to protect the interests of depositors, we need banks and we need financial stability.  The Bill will give the Central Bank the necessary powers for these purposes but the Central Bank has not exactly covered itself in glory in the past.  Banking authorities must be held accountable for their actions and the action is needed before a bank's balance sheet is insolvent.I understand choices have to be made and balances struck between the protection of shareholders and the protection of the public and depositors' interests.  However, the protection of shareholders should not be paramount.With regard to the "special manager", in the opinion of the Central Bank, the person chosen will have "the requisite knowledge, expertise and experience of the financial services sector to be the special manager".  This will have the effect of suspending the rights and powers of shareholders and members.  The special manager has extensive powers to remove people in employment and those in positions, so those people who will be special managers, while they must have those considerable credentials, will also, I hope, be guided by values of honesty and truthfulness in carrying out their work.I have been contacted by certain credit unions in my constituency.  I understand a strategic review is being undertaken and that the report is overdue.  It appears the credit union regulator is making decisions on credit union reform before the commission has completed its work.  Credit unions have played a very important role in this country and have been the saviour of many individuals and families.  There is a strong community base, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and they provided an alternative to the money lenders charging 140% interest and more, who also took social welfare books and pension books from vulnerable people who were desperate for money to pay bills or cover the cost of Christmas.The credit unions also have a very strong voluntary element which must be acknowledged, as must the fact that the members own the organisation.  They are different from banks and I would not like to see the undermining of credit unions.  I accept there is a need for good governance but the majority have worked well under the current governance and they play a very important role in providing credit.It was interesting to read that from June 2009 to June 2010 those credits unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions provided €2.5 billion in loans to their members.  If there are weaknesses, potential or real, they cannot be ignored, but I hope action will not be taken arbitrarily.  While I know some credit unions are considering amalgamation, I hope the wishes of the credit unions can be taken into account.  We need to have a balance between holding onto the traditional credit union ethos — community focused, member focused and in the best interest of the members — and not allow or facilitate a return to the money lenders, which I hear about at present in Dublin Central.My final point concerns the need for regulation in all our institutions, including the church, the State and Departments, and the need for regulation regarding the big level operators and the big commercial interests.  What appears to be happening is that families, those looking for mortgages and small businesses are being swamped by excessive regulation.Such swamping is delaying real activity in the real economy, thereby leading to a stagnation in Irish society.  Consequently, banks and lobbyists for big business are setting out to convince people that less regulation is required.  I recently met representatives from small businesses who have been in business for more than 30 years, have paid all their bills to those who supply them and have paid their workers etc.  However, they have been left high and dry by larger developers who had contracted them and who now are in foreign fields making more profit but are not paying their just debts in Ireland.  I wonder whether the wrong people are being regulated excessively.  It should be senior bankers and not the person on the street who did not trigger the problem in the first place.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	409	This is a rather appropriate day to discuss this Bill.  While Members have had economics for ethics, it is time they had ethics for economics.  This is a good day in respect of events in Europe.  My speech was written two weeks ago but now is as relevant as one written two years ago.  While the issues have been tackled on a national basis, more must be done on a European basis.  As for the euro's institutional framework, insufficient fiscal disciplines were imposed by the European Union and given an absence of mechanisms to control economic imbalances, we ended up in a position in which our country, as well as several others, could not sustain the level of debt imposed upon them.  This was largely due to the banks.The NTMA produced a report this morning on its function within the banking system and mentions the IMF having a significant function within that.  Unfortunately, some of our economic sovereignty has been lost for two reasons, namely, the imprudence of the banks, combined with a lack of foresight on the part of the Government.  In common with many previous speakers, I have worked in financial institutions and as a recent speaker mentioned, there was a completely inappropriate culture involving financial recklessness and an inability to perceive what was right for the country.Financial institutions are licensed by the Government because of their significance in society and because of what they can do to society.  They are necessary and provide much that is good.  For most people, they permit access to a home by enabling one to get started on a property ladder or to get on with daily modern lives through the purchase of a car.  However, greed and short-sightedness became the culture, as well as a complete inability to philosophise what it is an institution or a society should be trying to achieve.  It was akin to an adolescent period for the country and we have learnt from costly mistakes.  However, today probably will be highly significant.  Heretofore, we have had a currency that had multiple central banks.  I completely disagree with this and am on record as having stated the euro was ill-conceived to begin with.  I should clarify I agree with the concept of the euro but not the manner in which it was established.  I was lucky to have studied economics in central Europe in 1999 and 2000 and I can recall one of my professors telling me to question Ireland's reasons for entering the euro.  The idea that a currency could have multiple central banks without having an overriding fiscal policy meant, for example, that loan to deposit ratios differed.  If one put €10 on deposit in a German bank, it might have lent out €12, whereas in Ireland, a bank might have lent out €22 on foot of a €10 deposit.  Consequently, using the same currency without having influence over one's interest rates, duration of credit etc., meant we had a completely separate financial outlook on our economy then did the central bank of the currency, which is inappropriate.  I believe steps will be made towards addressing this issue in the future.This Bill entails taking steps locally.  I am convinced the regulator here, that is, the Central Bank of Ireland, did not know what was its role for some time.  I have worked on reports for institutions that were handed to the Central Bank of Ireland and I assure Members the level of detail contained therein was comprehensive and nothing was missing.  However, the philosophy as to what it was trying to achieve was wrong.  Moreover, there was a lack of knowledge within the Department of Finance, as well as a culture within the country whereby current income was being used for current expenditure.  One does not even run a house like that, let alone a country.  It is like winning the lottery and using it on day-to-day spending.  The whole property idea was ill-conceived and is what drove the banks off the edge.However, I refer to today's developments.  I am not revealing any information because I do not have it — the Minister will know a great deal more in this regard — but some draft documents on what is happening in Brussels have appeared on the Internet.  If they are to be believed, it appears as though Ireland is in a position to get significant interest rate cuts, which the Government stated it would do.  Obviously, this was not achieved in isolation and there has been a pan-European strategy in this regard.  I have held meetings with many European social democrats and am aware the Christian Democrats have done likewise.  There have been meetings with people from Germany, Scandinavia, Britain, France etc. and we have conveyed the message that our country was in real trouble, as was the currency.  One only needed to pick up any financial newspaper or magazine to realise that matters were coming to a head.  Moreover, we have developed friendships and have developed trust again.  We are in a better position than was the case last year or indeed four months ago.  In addition, as Deputy Wallace once noted, one must be able to work with one's creditors and institutions and I note the European Central Bank, ironically, is now doing what it is being told by the Commission, the Heads of Government and the IMF.  They have realised they needed to protect the people because the European Union is about protecting people and is not about wealth for a small group of people.  Today's events will play a significant part in allowing the project to develop because they demonstrate there is a resolve to look after what is important.  It also appears as though Ireland's corporation tax will remain intact and if that is the case, it constitutes another great event.One point I wish to highlight is that I have seen auditors enter a financial institution.  However, as for the people who actually arrived at one's desk at 8 a.m. to perform audits on files that could take up six or seven boxes, for all the experience they had, the only thing they lacked was a pair of short pants.  They were being paid €17 per hour, while the auditing firms were charging the time out at €200 per hour, and would return to one's desk at 11 a.m. to confirm the aforementioned files were fine.  Superman would not have got through those files in three hours, never mind a bunch of trainee accountants.  Consequently, the way I would describe it is that culpability lies in many places but among few people.  The vast majority of people who work in financial institutions are hard-working honest people who do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  The culture of greed existed amongst the highest elite, for whom bonuses were on a here and now basis, rather than on how banking is supposed to work.  As it must take a long-term view, there should be long-term bonuses.  I do not believe Members will again see in their lifetimes the reckless promotion of people who were making short-term gains for a company or institution.  The reason this sector is licensed is because it is meant to be prudent at all times.While the diplomatic offensive appears to be working, an offensive also is needed within Ireland.  I note the country may secure interest rate reductions and may end up with the duration of its term loans being doubled.  However, it all comes back to the point that the country is running an enormous deficit.  As there will be further cuts, it is the job of both the Government and the non-Government parties to find the fairest way to impose those cuts and make Ireland viable again.  It will be necessary for Ireland to take two steps back and by so doing, one must consider what one has done heretofore.  In Ireland's case, we have created a mess that we will clean up.  We will set about creating growth and jobs again because it is all about trying to create a standard of living and a better country for the people.Today is a great day and the speech I prepared two weeks ago is no longer relevant.  I am delighted to see the Minister in the Chamber on the last day of the session.  It is not as though the Government orchestrated the last sitting day to fall on a day on which a meeting would be held in Brussels but it appears as though good news is afoot.  However, the deficit must be tackled and the many Members who have ideas in this respect always should convey them.  I look forward to next Tuesday, when the Taoiseach will attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, of which I am a member, when it will have an opportunity to ask him questions on what has happened heretofore.There also are concerns regarding what banks can do to institutions of Government and this will not be allowed to happen again.  While both the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator must have roles in this regard, this Bill states the European Central Bank will have a role.  It will regulate, watch and have an overriding oversight on what constitutes prudent lending and what is a prudent financial institution.  I am delighted by this development, as are many people throughout Europe.  I believe it will lead to a better European Union and Ireland will be in a position to achieve real growth, have a correction and drive forward.  Today is a highly significant day on which I am delighted the House will break up for the summer.  I wish all Members a very pleasant break and I hope we will all return refreshed.  I hope some Members might even take a trip to Kerry.

However, I do not believe the correct culture is in place.  Deputy Spring highlighted in his contribution the culture which led to our banking failures.  We still have a way to go before we can ensure that banks are far less likely to fail and that if they fail, the resolution process at the heart of this Bill will produce the best possible outcome for the people.I welcome the Bill and had this legislation been in place in 2008, we might have avoided some of the horrendous decisions which have to be made.  Any resolution process to deal with banks which are about to fail must be timely, transparent, effective and fair.  It must allow for reasonable due process.  The ECB is broadly happy with the timeliness and effectiveness of the Bill but it has expressed some reservations about fairness, some due process issues and the transparency of the process.  Specifically, the ECB cites the lack of time for interested parties to react.  If the Minister has to take action and go to the courts to force a resolution process, the ECB is concerned that other interested parties may not have sufficient time to represent themselves in that process. The bank is also concerned that the independence of the Central Bank of Ireland is not explicitly set out in the Bill.  I put those points to the Minister for his consideration as to whether they can be included in the Bill.My concern is how the Bill has been developed and that in-depth parliamentary investigation is not included.  The Bill seems to be the product of good practice as viewed by the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, the Bank for International Settlements and by a collection of other central banks.  I agree this is a good start and the Bill is a result of the agreement with the troika.However, I suggest that the Bill lacks a local context.  The US banking resolution regime legislation and the wider financial regulations, were drafted many decades ago and were the product of parliamentary scrutiny of the banking sector.  The US congressional hearings in the 1930s probed the bankers and sought to understand the local banking sector.  These hearings examined the problems of the US banking sector and also the culture of the banking sector and then drafted legislation which resulted in the Glass Steagall Act.  The importance of Congress was seen in the 1980s during the savings and loan crisis when William Black exposed corruption and a culture of deceit and manipulation in the US banking system.  I think this would resonate with many Members and with many people in Ireland.  This informed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC Improvement Act and the Dodd-Frank Act which are key pieces of legislation.The Oireachtas has not had the ability to build up a sufficiently large base of analysis and to use its understanding of the particular idiosyncrasies of Ireland and of our political, regulatory and banking cultures.  I suggest it might help to strengthen the Bill further if this process were put in place in order that the relevant committee would have real investigative power to ensure the Bill not only reflects international best practice but also particular Irish idiosyncrasies.  The various reports such as the Honohan, Wright and Nyberg reports have thrown some light on the problems, but only certain aspects of the problems, and these reports were also time restricted.  The Nyberg report, in my view, was a grey wash, in that it blamed everyone and therefore no one was to blame.  I suggest it cannot be used to deal specifically with what should be changed or safeguarded in legislation.The famous US Justice Louis Brandeis said that sunshine is the best disinfectant.  The power of the FDIC in the United States is the power of the transparency of its actions and its structure.  The FDIC website describes in detail the procedures it follows in the winding-up of banks and how depositors are protected.  This form of transparency within our process would not only make for a better process, it would give the public and legislators some much needed faith in the process.There are concerns about the independence of the Central Bank and the ECB commented that it would like to see a specific provision in the Bill.  I regard this Bill as a good beginning and some of the comments from the ECB would add to the power of the Bill.  Some deeper parliamentary investigation and input to tailor it specifically to Ireland would be very welcome.Deputy Spring clearly spoke with first-hand experience of some of the problems in the culture of banking regulation.  The culture of regulation needs to be improved in five areas which are the political culture, the regulatory culture, the culture of the Central Bank, the culture of the Department of Finance and the culture of the banks.As regards the political culture, we all know the former Taoiseach played golf with the former chief executive of one of the biggest offenders, Anglo Irish Bank.  The chair of the incumbent political party had become the head of the banking federation and there had been an extraordinary capture of the Government by the interested parties.  I have no doubt this is something the Minister and his colleagues watched from this side of the House for many years.  I hope this will all be put to bed.As regards the regulatory culture, I refer to Deputy Ross's book, The Bankers, which gives an extraordinary account of a dinner which took place in November 2008.  The dinner was hosted by the senior management of the banks for the recently retired regulator and attended by the new regulator.  This is a small number of weeks after the banks convinced — I say hoodwinked — the Government into providing a guarantee bigger than our GDP.  In a restaurant not far from this Chamber, the bankers were entertaining the regulators.  I have worked in the United States and in the United Kingdom and in those countries the regulator would be fired immediately if he or she were to have dinner with senior bankers.  This is an extraordinary situation and I hope we will not see this happen again.The issues to do with the Central Bank include the tradition whereby the Secretary General of the Department of Finance subsequently became the Governor of the Central Bank.  Being Secretary General of the Department of Finance does not equip someone to become Governor of the Central Bank and it was an extraordinary and ultimately damaging tradition.  A second issue for the Central Bank is one of expertise.  The Wright report stated that 39 of 542 staff of the bank were trained to masters degree or higher in economics, which is 7%.  In Canada it is 60% and in the Netherlands it is 40%.  While I do not know whether it is within the remit of the Minister, this issue needs to be addressed urgently.  It would be great to see some serious up-skilling in order that we can at least get on par with places like Canada, which, of course, avoided the banking collapse in which we find ourselves.Another issue is the culture of the Department of Finance itself.  On this there is an issue of expertise.  The late Dr. Garret FitzGerald cited that in 2009 the Department of Finance had only three members of staff with PhD qualifications and only one of these was working in macroeconomics.  I have worked with public servants, as have most if not all Deputies in the House.  My singular experience here and abroad is of people who want to do the very best and have a genuinely patriotic outlook.  However, they also need the education and training.  That may be a combination of providing programmes where people in the Department can be trained up and deployed accordingly, and hiring in more capability.  Having one person with a PhD working on macroeconomics in 2009, if Dr. FitzGerald's assertion is correct, is extraordinary and deeply worrying.  I hope something can be done about that.Obviously the culture within the banks largely led to the situation in which we find ourselves.  It has been spoken about and rehearsed many times.  I am concerned that many of the senior teams are still in place.  I know the Minister has told the House that it is his intention to rectify that.  I reiterate my concern that much of the cultural legacy will remain until the senior teams are refreshed.

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I welcome the Bill.  As Members will be aware, the Bill replaces the much criticised Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act passed in December.  It is worth noting the amount of time the Government has spent undoing much of the emergency work and non-work of the previous Government.  I commend the Minister for Finance on the work he has done in such a short period of time.Clearly these proposals will allow the Central Bank to deal with lenders who fail or are likely to fail.  The history lessons are there for all of us and it is important we continue to work towards putting in place a banking structure that will give confidence back to our people.  The Governor of the Central Bank rather than the Minister will trigger this new regime.  It is very important we allow the Central Bank to deal quickly and effectively when problems arise because this clearly has not happened in the past.The Bill included measures in line with evolving EU principles on crisis resolution and in the light of discussions that will take place with external partners.  We must continue to work very hard to co-ordinate our efforts with our European partners.  As Deputy Spring correctly said, it is most opportune that we are here working on this Bill at this time when the Taoiseach is discussing our interest rate and other issues pertaining to the country.  We all wish him the very best.In addition to banks, the powers of the Bill will apply to building societies and credit unions.  It is important to acknowledge that the credit union commission has been established.  The credit unions are doing remarkable work and have done so throughout the banking crisis.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a bridge bank to temporarily hold some of the institutions' assets and liabilities.  The credit institutions resolution fund is to be established to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability or to prevent the imminent threat of financial instability of an authorised credit institution.It is crucial we continue to work towards a fairer sharing of the cost of restructuring Irish banks.  We must work towards a more transparent assessment of the capital needs of Irish banks, and Irish bankers need to continue to shrink their balance sheets to reduce their excessive dependence on volatile non-deposit funding sources which has been the case to date.  Most importantly we must continue to work to restore confidence in the Irish banking sector to get our banks lending to businesses, which we hope will flourish and consequently employ people who will pay taxes and thereby get the country back up and running.  It is a rather simple economic model but it is a very clear path towards the country's recovery.We need to rebuild a competitive, well-managed but also privately owned banking system.  In that regard it is very welcome that for the first time in many years we are putting the Government back in charge of how our banking system is structured.  We need to work to promote new leadership and management in our banks.  As has been said, we have many good people working within the banking sector but the leadership they received has let down many people in the State, both those working for the banks and people who deal with the banks in many key areas.  Banks should squeeze their costs before their customers.  Even of late we have seen far too many examples of senior people in the banking sector continue to take perks that should be discontinued in the current climate.  Once they are made stronger, we must work as a matter of urgency to return the viable banks into private ownership which will foster greater competition in the marketplace.  Great work is already being done in shutting down dead banks.I commend the Minister on the legislation and wish him the best of luck in the future.  As has been said on many occasions, the Government is at the start of a journey.  In its first term since its election a few months ago it has done some very good work.  I join Deputy Spring in wishing everyone a good summer.  I do not need to sell my county of Cork as hard as the Kerry people have to sell theirs, but they are of course all welcome and we might see Deputy Spring and others from his county in September again in Croke Park.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	418	We will sort them out then.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I welcome today's indications of very good news which will provide greater sustainability for the Irish economy.  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Bill 2011 is one of the requirements of the EU and IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.  The measures in the Bill include what is commonly known as a special resolution regime, SRR.  This new legislation originates under the EU and IMF bailout that was negotiated under the previous Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government.  While in some ways it is a case of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted, a special resolution regime is an important part of any modern economy's financial regulation.  That is one reason the Government is proceeding with it.  It is telling that in its 14 years of government, Fianna Fáil never legislated for one.  Another reason is that, under the memorandum of understanding agreed by the Fianna Fáil-led Government with the EU-IMF, we must proceed with legislation.A special resolution regime, SRR, is intended to allow for a more orderly resolution of failing banks and other financial institutions, including building societies and credit unions.  In particular, credit unions have been hamstrung by the bailout regulations.  The normal winding up procedures available to companies under the Companies Acts are inadequate when it comes to institutions of this kind.  In the US where more than 140 banks have failed in the past year or so, the equivalent legislation has been much utilised.  Britain hurriedly enacted measures in 2009 in the wake of the Northern Rock failure.  Similar regimes are also being created at EU level.The Bill is intended to come into effect when the interim measures in the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, the CIS Act, lapse at the end of 2012.  When enacted, it will give the Central Bank powers to deal with financial institutions that are failing or likely to fail.  The main powers are, first, to establish so-called bridge banks to hold the assets and liabilities of failing institutions temporarily pending transfer to a third party; second, to make a transfer order to a third party in respect of a failing institution, subject to prior notice to the institution concerned and approval of the order by the High Court.  If there is an imminent threat to the financial stability of the institution or of the financial system in the State, there is no obligation to notify the institution in advance. The third power is to make a special management order whereby the Central Bank would take over the effective management of an institution that is failing.  Subject to an imminent threat to financial stability, any such order would be on prior notice to the financial institution concerned and subject to the approval of the High Court.Under the legislation, the Minister for Finance has powers to make financial incentives, such as loans or guarantees, available to any proposed acquirer of a financial institution.  The Minister will also have powers in respect of the winding up of a financial institution, for example, the requirement that nobody can appoint a liquidator without the Central Bank's approval.  The Minister will have the power to direct a financial institution to prepare and implement a recovery plan, together with powers to prepare a resolution plan for that institution.This legislation serves to reinforce Ireland's commitment to resolve and restore the confidence of the public and greater transparency in the financial services sector.  This is to be achieved through the process of open and transparent regulation, an effective and efficient resolution regime for failing institutions and the active process of deleveraging and downsizing some of the existing institutions in an orderly and transparent manner.  The proposed changes and the commitment of the Central Bank and the Government to implement them will assist in remedying some of the disparities in the system and, with renewed confidence, lead the institutions into the next decade.I have criticised the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government previously and will do so again, because it must be repeated that the former Government left the Irish people an awful legacy.  The current Administration is determined to leave Ireland and her people a better legacy by getting on with fulfilling the EU-IMF obligations, such as the legislation before the House, to which the former Administration signed up the State.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I thank the Deputies who participated in this Second Stage debate for their thoughtful contributions on what is undoubtedly an important piece of legislation.  Many expressed a welcome for the provisions of the Bill, recognising the importance of the State having available to it a comprehensive toolkit to address financial institutions that are in distress.Turning to some of the specific issues raised, many Deputies referred to the situation in Greece and drew comparisons with Ireland.  There are significant differences between the positions in Ireland and in other peripheral economies.  Ireland is a dynamic economy with a strong medium-term growth potential.  Irish goods, services and Irish labour and capital markets are flexible, a fact borne out by various OECD studies.  As one of the most open economies in the world, Ireland is well positioned to achieve export-led growth even when domestic demand is contracting.  The current account of the balance of payments in Ireland moved into surplus last year.  This means that Ireland as a whole is no longer increasing its external liabilities and is in surplus.The roots of our problems are also different.  Ireland's loss of market access is mainly related to the fiscal costs associated with supporting the banking sector.  Other peripheral economies' difficulties are more of a structural nature, such as inbuilt rigidities and weak competitiveness, that will take longer to rectify.  Like Ireland, however, these countries are taking and continue to take determined steps to resolve the difficulties they face.  We have the features of a north European-type economy and not a Mediterranean one.  Our model is entirely different from that found in the other countries experiencing difficulties.A number of Deputies raised the related issues of the Government's proposed approach to burden sharing with senior bondholders in the banks and the fact that the Bill does not provide for powers to impose losses on senior bondholders.  The Government's position on imposing losses on senior bondholders has not changed from the position I set out in my statement on banking on 31 March.  All senior bondholders in the pillar banks of AIB-EBS and Bank of Ireland and in Irish Life & Permanent, whether guaranteed or unguaranteed, will be repaid in full.  As I stated in March and a number of times since, this is essential to maintain the market reputation of these institutions and to ensure their return to market funding in due course.However, I also indicated that the position regarding the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, institutions in different circumstances from the remainder of the banking system, would be considered following the completion of the independent review of the capital requirements of both banks last month.  While the Central Bank has concluded that no additional capital is required for them, this does not remove the onus on the Government to consider all options to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of resolving these institutions.  Therefore, in the autumn I will raise the issue of burden sharing to allow for the imposition of losses on unguaranteed and unsecured senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and INBS with the IMF and EU authorities.A number of Deputies pointed out that the Bill does not contain any provision for burden sharing with holders of subordinated debt, as is the case in the CIS Act enacted at the end of last year.  It is important to understand that the Bill is intended to put a mainstream conventional resolution regime in place consistent with international good practice where it exists.  The covered or guaranteed banks that are being restructured are not within the scope of the Bill at this time.  Rather, the Bill will apply to credit institutions that have not been the beneficiaries of major public support during the past two and half years or so.The burden sharing powers under the CIS Act provide the legal basis for actions under way for these institutions as part of the restructuring of the banking system.  As Deputies are aware, the CIS Act already provides for the making of subordinated liabilities orders to allow for burden sharing with subordinated bondholders and I have already used this power in respect of AIB.  The banks being restructured have already received significant State support in advance of any contribution from bondholders and the Government is seeking to reduce further the cost of recapitalisation of these banks through imposing appropriate losses on subordinated bondholders.As Deputies will be aware, liability management exercises, LMEs, are under way in Bank of Ireland and Irish Life & Permanent.  Ensuring that holders of junior debt in the banks make a significant contribution to the overall cost of recapitalising the banks following the results of the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, exercise is a key policy objective supported by the external authorities.  Once the LMEs are complete, the authorities will examine the further steps required to support this objective, including by utilising the legal powers available to the Minister under the CIS Act.The resolution Bill is forward looking with a wider scope than the stabilisation Act.  It provides the Central Bank with tools for the resolution of institutions and is focussed on ensuring that the resolution, rather than stabilisation, of an institution does not impact of the stability of the financial system.The issue of burden sharing with senior creditors, or "bail-in mechanisms" as they are generally referred to, remains under discussion internationally but as yet no clear consensus has emerged.  Any pre-emptive action on our part by including such tools in our "steady-state" special resolution regime in advance of agreement at EU and international level could have significant negative consequences in particular for the international banks within the scope of this Bill; for example, it could lead to ratings downgrades for these banks.  It also would be expected to generate negative sentiment among market participants towards Ireland owing to the perceived uncertainty regarding our commitment to an agreed international methodology on bail-in mechanisms.A number of Deputies mentioned the resolution fund to be established under the Bill.  A clear lesson from the crisis has been the importance of ensuring that there are mechanisms in place to ensure the financial sector makes an appropriate contribution to the cost of resolving institutions in difficulties.  The introduction of a bank levy is one of the objectives set out in the programme for Government and this Bill will provide for the introduction of such a levy, through the establishment of a resolution fund, based on contributions from authorised credit institutions.  However, it is important that the timing of the imposition of this cost on the financial sector, and its potential impact on the financial position of authorised credit institutions is considered carefully and not rushed into, particularly given the difficulties still facing the sector overall.  For that reason, and to allow for an appropriate flexibility in the level of contributions individual institutions are required to make to the fund, the Bill provides that this detail be set out in regulations.I will be requesting the Central Bank of Ireland to undertake an analysis of the appropriate calibration of the banks' contribution in relation to base and rate and for its possible phased introduction having regard to the financial position of the Irish domestic banks in particular and the plans outlined in my statement of 31 March on the future structure of the sector.The fund may be used to finance the cost of the resolution tools provided for in the Bill including providing capital for a bridge bank and reimbursing the Minister for any financial incentives provided for the transfer of assets and liabilities.  Of course it will take time to develop a fund which holds a significant level of funds while ensuring that the level of contribution for the banks is commercially sustainable and in line with international norms.  To take account of this lag, the legislation provides that the Minister may also make contributions to the fund; this would allow the fund to be used even if industry contributions do not meet the requirements of a particular resolution.  However, the legislation provides that the Minister will be reimbursed for any such contributions to the fund.  It is very important to stress that ultimately it will be the industry rather than taxpayers that will bear the cost of resolutions in the future.Deputy Pringle had concerns regarding the intervention conditions.  The intervention conditions are a cornerstone of the approach to resolution set out in this Bill; transfer orders and special management orders can be made only where certain conditions are met.  These conditions include a requirement that the Central Bank is satisfied that the institution is failing or is likely to fail to meet a regulatory requirement or a requirement or condition of its licence or authorisation.  The intervention conditions in the Bill take into account work underway in the EU and the resolution regimes that have been put in place in other member states.  In particular it is generally recognised that there is a balance to be struck between "hard triggers" which require action to be taken and "soft triggers" which allow for some flexibility.The intervention conditions in the Bill look to achieve this balance while allowing action to be taken by the Central Bank at a sufficiently early stage.  It is a major priority to ensure the Governor is persuaded that the use of the resolution powers is in the public interest rather than winding up of an institution.I have noted the concerns of a number of Deputies regarding the need to take into account the special role of credit unions within the community and the difference between them and the commercial banks.  The Programme for Government 2011-2016 recognises the importance of credit unions as a volunteer movement and that strong credit unions with a community focus and volunteer ethos should remain a central part of the Irish financial landscape.The Government has established a commission on credit unions which has begun its work.  Having regard to the particular nature of the credit union sector, the commission will review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations to Government on the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking into account their traditional role.  This is to be achieved while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors' savings and financial stability.The Government has also included in the terms of reference for the commission a requirement to make recommendations in respect of any immediate policy proposals on foot of our work under the EU-IMF programme of support for Ireland.  Ireland's commitments under the programme include undertaking stress tests on credit unions and carrying out a review of credit union loan books.  This exercise has been completed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Under the programme, I have also prepared a strategy to underpin the solvency and viability of any undercapitalised credit unions and my officials are in further discussions on the detailed aspects of implementing this strategy.By the end of 2011, and in line with the EU-IMF programme of support for Ireland, the Government will submit legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas to assist the credit unions with a strengthened regulatory framework including more effective governance and regulatory requirements.  The commission on credit unions will provide me with an interim report at the end of September which will contain proposals in this regard.  The Government has requested the commission to submit a final report by the end of March 2012.Deputy McGrath made reference to businesses being forced to convert an overdraft facility into a term loan and Deputy Halligan referred to the pillar banks not meeting businesses' need for credit.  These issues can both be referred to the Credit Review Office.  Under their review regime, "refusal" includes a decision by a participating institution to reduce or withdraw an existing credit facility as well as an outright refusal.  The Credit Review Office will, on application from the borrower, carry out an independent and impartial review of a bank's decision to refuse or reduce credit.  I would strongly advise anyone who has unsuccessfully appealed through the bank's own internal appeals process to seek a review by the Credit Review Office.Deputy Ross raised issues about a lack of change in the prevailing culture and board renewal at the covered institutions.  The figures quoted by the Deputy on the number of pre-crisis directors remaining at Bank of Ireland are not wholly accurate.  Following its recent AGM, where the resignation of several directors took place, four pre-crisis directors are still in post, although higher figures were mentioned by the Deputy.  These, along with all other directors, at all of the remaining covered institutions, irrespective of date of appointment who intend to be in office on 1 January 2012, will be subject, as announced by the Central Bank of Ireland, to assessment against the new fitness and probity standards for such appointments which the CBI envisages being implemented by 1 September 2011.Subsequent to the July AGM of AIB and consequent on the recent mergers involving EBS and INBS only ten pre-crisis directors will still be in post — a reduction of almost 90%.  The Government has sought board renewal plans from the institutions and has committed to establishing a pool of qualified candidates who would be suitable for appointments to bank boards subject to appropriate regulatory approval.  Work is ongoing in this matter and the Deputy can expect new and fresh appointments in coming months to ensure the boards are fit for purpose to play their vital role in the necessary restructuring of the banking sector.The Government programme commits the Government to introducing a comprehensive special resolution regime for dealing with bank insolvencies and a bank levy.  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No.2) Bill provides a basis for achieving these important commitments in the Government's programme on a SRR and bank levy to ensure that the financial industry contributes to the cost of any resolution measures in the future.I propose to bring forward a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to enhance the Bill's provisions in the light of further deliberations since its publication, including discussion with the EU and IMF authorities.  I look forward to a detailed engagement with Deputies on Committee Stage and thank Deputies again for their contributions to the debate on Second Stage.  I have heard with interest the contributions of Deputies.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and Deputy Dara Murphy spoke about the importance of credit unions, and I dealt with that subject in my reply.  Deputy O'Sullivan also mentioned the difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises are having in accessing credit.  As I pointed out, the Credit Review Office takes appeals.  Just some days ago, I raised the limit for its consideration from €250,000 to €500,000 because it was brought to my attention that many of the small firms in difficulty found themselves above the ceiling of €250,000.  The main difficulty arises for firms with working capital requirements of between €250,000 and €500,000 so that is now within the remit of the Credit Review Office and appeals can be made there.There is a lot of anecdotal evidence about credit, but some of it does not seem to be accurate.  In the period of office of the credit review officer, only 83 appeals were made to that office by persons with credit requirements under €250,000.  We will see where it goes when the new limit is put in place.  Frequently, worse cases come to our attention as public representatives.  There seem to be as many problems with the lack of demand for credit as with the lack of credit supply in the economy at the moment.Deputy Arthur Spring made a good analysis of the situation, as did Deputy Seán Kenny, in referring to events in Brussels today.  I hope everything works out well, but such negotiations are always difficult.  Unanimity is required, so what is put forward in the first proposal is not necessarily what comes out at the end.  I hope everything will go well.  We have brought about a situation where the main policy instruments we require are up for discussion but, as I said, it requires unanimity to get things over the line.  We will know the situation later tonight, I presume.Deputy Stephen Donnelly had a strong analytical approach to the Bill as well and I agree with many of the points he made.  I will be open to considering amendments to improve the Bill.  It is the kind of legislation that should be constructed by Members on all sides of the House before Final Stage is reached.  It is an evolving debate and Committee Stage will take place in the next session.  I intend bringing forward some amendments on the basis of the debate that has already taken place.  We will look on their merits at any amendments Deputies may wish to table.I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  As Deputy Spring already said, I hope Deputies will have a good break.  It has been a long year for anyone who started campaigning well before the election, worked their way through the election and then on to the first session of the new Dáil.  I think a break will be welcomed by everybody.

Is cinnte go mbeimid ag dul i gcomhairle leis an choimisinéir féin agus ní fheicim aon deacracht go mbeimid i gcomhairle leis an chomhchoiste mar go bhfuil ionchur tábhachtach aige i gcúrsaí teanga agus Gaeltachta.  Aon duine nó eagraíochta ag a bhfuil suim a gcuid tuairimí a chur i láthair, beidh fáilte rompu san athbhreithniú.  Tá me cinnte go dtuigfidh an Teachta agus na Teachtaí eile go bhfuil an tAcht ag feidhmiú anois le beagnach deich mbliana agus go bhfuil sé in am cuí go ndéanfar aithbhreithniú ar an Acht féin.  Má tá laigeachtaí ann nó aon leasuithe le déanamh, déanfar ansin iad.  Rachaimid i gcomhairle agus éinne ag a bhfuil moladh, glacfar leo agus déanfar é a scrúdú.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh na téarmaí tagartha ann i mí Mheán an Fhómhair agus go mbeidh an t-aithbhreithniú críochnaithe taobh istigh de bhliain ina dhiaidh sin.

Ní dhearna Feidhmeannachta na Seirbhíse Sláinte agus Ard-Mhuseam na hÉireann athchomharc chun na Ard-Chúirte i gcoinne an chinnidh a rinne an coimisinéar ach fós níor chuir siad moltaí i bhfeidhm.  Dúirt an coimisinéir is ar Tithe an Oireachtais a thiteann an dualgas anois.  Tá sinn freagrach anois an fhadhb seo a réiteach.An bhliain seo caite, theip ar 25% de na comhlachtaí poiblí a gcuid dualgais faoin Acht a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá an t-am ag sleamhnú thart agus ní faic déanta ag an Rialtas.  Inniu chonaic muid céim siar eile ó thaobh an Bhille um Dhlí Sibhialta.  Ní chaithfidh an Rialtas anois Billí a fhoilsiú ar an Idirlíon i nGaeilge ag an am céanna leis an chóip Bhéarla.  Cúpla seachtain ó shin, athraíodh an córas ar an dóigh a thugtar aitheantas do Ghaelscoileanna.  Beidh sé níos deacra anois Gaelscoil a bhunú.  Tá a lán oibre á déanamh ag an Rialtas ach tá an obair sin in éadan na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge.  Is cúis phráinneach é seo agus iarraim ar an Aire Feidhmeannacht na Seirbhíse Sláinte agus an tArd-Mhuseam a thabhairt isteach anseo agus ceist a chur orthu cén fáth nach na dualgais sin comhlíonta go dtí anois.  Is féidir linn iad a thabhairt isteach chuig an choiste.  An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta sin a dhéanamh go bhfreagróidh siad ceisteanna maidir le cén fáth nach bhfuil siad chun na dualgais atá acu ó thaobh teanga de a chomhlíonadh?

Má tharlaíonn sé, beidh sé i gceart.Maidir leis an leasú atáá dheanamh le halt 7 Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúil, is cinnte go ndéantar é sin ar bhonn go raibh deacrachtaí ann go dtí seo.  Ní sháraíonn sin an tAcht féin, go gcuirtear an leagan Gaeilge agus an leagan Béarla de Bhillí a ritheann fríd an Oireachtas agus atá sínithe ag an Uachtarán a fhoilsiú go comhuaineach ach bhí deacrachtaí mar go bhfuil moill leis an fhoilsiú sin.  Bhí sé ag cothú deacrachtaí go bhfuil Billí ann atá ina ndlíthe don tír nach bhfuil leagan ar bith ar fáil.  Sin an fáth gur cinneadh iad a chur ar an Idirlíon ach ní hionann sin agus a rá nach gcloífear leis an fhoráil atá san Acht go bhfoilseofar iad sa dá theanga go comhuaineach.  Bhí sé riachtanach é seo a dhéanamh mar bhí daoine ag teacht os comhair na gcúirteanna agus bhí dlíodóirí agus breithimh ar lorg Achtanna nach raibh ar fáil ar chor ar bith mar tá sé de dhualgas orainn faoin Acht é a fhoilsiú go comhuaineach i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge.  Níl ann ach rud sealadach agus leanfar ar aghaidh leis an dualgas atá orainn faoin Acht féin, nuair a thiocfaidh an leagan crua, foilseofar é as Gaeileg agus as Béarla.

Ní aon mhaith ann bheith ag iarraidh daoine a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge agus seirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge mura bhfuilimid sásta an Ghaeilge a chur ar an leibhéal céanna leis an Bhéarla.

We are intent on pursuing this agenda while recognising the limited financial resources available and taking account of the evolving budgetary and Estimates positions.  I am pleased to report that in the four months since taking office, progress is being made on a number of fronts in regard to our commitments in the programme for Government.  Strategic policy formulation is the primary function of my Department and significant work has been undertaken on its new statement of strategy.  Dialogue has been initiated within the arts community and with local authority arts officers with a view to introducing an interactive strategy and more co-ordination of their work at national and local level.  Interesting connections are being made with relevant individuals to explore the possibilities for philanthropy and other fund-raising activities.  In that context, the Department is now represented on the forum on philanthropy.I also understand that the Arts Council has been developing its touring policy.  Plans are now being finalised for Culture Night 2011 and I hope to progress publication of the 1926 census in coming months.In relation to the proposal regarding the use of NAMA buildings for cultural purposes, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has met the chair and chief executive of NAMA on the matter and those contacts will continue.  It would not be appropriate to comment in more detail on those discussions at this point.The next five years can be an exciting time for the arts, culture and film sectors.  Their integration into one Department, along with the Irish language, islands and heritage responsibilities, makes eminent sense and I look forward to seeking out and building on the self-evident synergies between these areas.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, when I express disappointment that the Minister is not in the Chamber to take questions.  The Technical Group facilitated the various changes to the parliamentary question rota that have occurred over recent weeks.Yesterday morning, the Minister attended the launch of the Dublin Fringe Festival at the Project Arts Centre.  When I spoke to him afterwards, he expressed his admiration for the drive and enthusiasm of the group of largely young people who organised the festival.  Many of these individuals were involved in Dublin Youth Theatre, which is housed in appalling accommodation in Gardiner Street.  However, even though the building is restricted and does not have enough room for its needs, Dublin Youth Theatre has produced a number of talented playwrights and actors.  I hope alternative accommodation for this group will be on the agenda when the Minister continues his discussions with NAMA.  When does the Minister of State envisage the Minister issuing a report on the discussions?The project for this year's final class of architecture students in DIT was "NAMA lands".  They came up with several interesting suggestions for NAMA's buildings, many of which are located in Dublin Central.  There was a particularly interesting proposal for that appalling monument to Anglo Irish Bank on North Wall.  Perhaps the Minister's attention can be drawn to the students' exhibition.

He regrets that he has another commitment and, as a result, is unable to attend.  I am deputising for him as the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht.The Minister has met the chief executive of NAMA on two occasions and discussions are ongoing.  The questions raised by the Deputy will be conveyed to him and I hope a reply will be furnished at the earliest opportunity.

There is a significant movement within community arts and I hope this area is well supported in the budget.

While I do not have responsibility for the arts, I attended or opened a number of arts festivals and exhibitions over the past several weekends.  A fortnight ago I visited Inis Oirr, where I had the honour of opening a fine exhibition by artists from Celtic countries, including Scotland, Wales and Ireland.  Last Friday I had the privilege of opening an art exhibition in my own parish.  There is a boom in the arts in every part of the country and that is to be welcomed.  The energy and creativity of these people are not hindered by the considerable financial constraints under which we must operate.  I am sure the Deputies opposite have had similar experiences of being invited to openings and seeing the genuine enthusiasm of those involved with the arts.  It is a great credit to the country.

The Minister met the chair and chief executive of Bank of Ireland and had a constructive engagement on the issues relating to the College Green building.  These contacts are continuing.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	440	That was not a particularly comprehensive reply.  I was hoping for more information than that.  It is a matter that is on the public agenda and it has been reported widely in the newspapers.  I would have liked to have heard a clear plan for what the Minister proposes to do with the building.  I acknowledge that it remains in Bank of Ireland's ownership but the State owns 36% of the same financial institution.  I support the Minister in his intentions for this historic building.  We are focusing on tourism as a way of generating employment.  I had hoped for a clear report of exactly what has happened to date and I am disappointed this has not materialised.  We should know exactly what the Minister intends to do with the building and the surrounding area.  Perhaps the Minister could furnish a written reply at a later date.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	441	As the Deputy knows, the topic is rather sensitive as meetings and discussions are ongoing, with further meetings planned.  Due to the nature of these discussions, it is difficult to say much at this time.  The process will continue, and as the Deputy noted, the announcement that the negotiations are continuing has received widespread welcome in the media and throughout the country.The building in question is an iconic part of the city centre, situated in an area with a strong association with literature.  Trinity College is nearby with its statues of Goldsmith — author of "The Deserted Village" — and Sheridan.  It is an ideal area for a literary and cultural centre.  I understand other buildings have also been considered, such as the National Museum and the National Library beside us.  I am sorry we cannot provide more information at this stage but perhaps on the next Question Time, after the summer recess, if negotiations continue we may be in a position to give more concrete information.  Negotiations over property and ownership can be fluid.Dublin has already been designated as a city of literature by UNESCO and it is only proper that we have an iconic building as part of this, such as the example mentioned by the Deputy.  It would provide a focus and we will see what will come from these negotiations.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I acknowledge that issues can be sensitive in negotiations.  Has the Department considered the cost implications of the project?  I am sure that before we considered anything, we looked at costs, which are a top priority in these straitened times.  I asked about the cost implications of the works in the initial question.  The Minister of State has correctly stated that this is an iconic building, and recently we saw President Obama address the large gathering with the building as a backdrop.  It was used by former President Clinton as well.  Nobody is questioning the historic importance of the buildings but has the Department examined cost implications?
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I am sure that with any initiative taken during these difficult economic times, costs and resources come into the equation.  I am sure that if there is to be any agreement, they will make up an important element of the outcome.  I have not been involved with the discussions but I am sure the Minister is very much aware of the constraints we all must operate under in these difficult times.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	444	As the Deputy will be aware, the North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting in July 2007 agreed to proceed with the restoration of the section of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.  The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of €35 million.  However, Government accounting procedures do not provide in that sense for ring-fencing funds for projects of this nature.I am advised that it was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual Estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of the council with regard to annual budgets.  I am advised also that it was also a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets, a scenario that was affected negatively by the economic downturn.That downturn is of major significance and presents serious difficulties to my Department during this period when there is such pressure on the public finances.  I intend to explore all possible options that may assist in the advancement of this project but it must also be recognised that the Government is engaged at present in a comprehensive review of expenditure, under which all spending is being examined rigorously.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister asked my Department to keep in regular contact with Waterways Ireland with a view to advancing the project to the extent possible within the current constraints.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that Waterways Ireland is in the process of finalising documentation to proceed to the stage of submitting an application for planning permission, which is a significant milestone for the project.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The Ulster Canal project holds enormous potential to open up the central Border area, which has experienced economic disadvantage for many years due to effects from its location.  The potential positive impact on all the towns and villages in the canal corridor would lead to significant regeneration and benefits due to increased tourism, business development and prosperity in general, not to mention the many construction and ancillary jobs that would be created.Does the Minister of State agree that this project can return major social, economic and peace dividends?  I appreciate that 2007 was a very different time to now, economically speaking, but the merits of the project stand.  Does the Minister of State agree that a large amount of preparatory work has already gone into the project, including feasibility and socio-economic studies, as well as extensive community and stakeholder consultation, to bring it to its current position?  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that this project is a priority in light of the economic, social and peace dividend, and in light of existing evidence that such amenities provide a substantial boost for local economies?  Is there potential for other canals to be taken in charge by Waterways Ireland?
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I agree with the Deputy's comments that completion of this project would bring great economic benefit to the area.  It is an almost unique area in the country, with Fermanagh being the county of islands and lakes.  I drove along the Erne last Sunday and returned in a happier mood with Donegal having won the Ulster football title.  The countryside looked even better on the return journey.  I went into a hotel on the banks of Lough Erne and saw the boats on the lake.  Completion of the project would bring great benefits, as tourist activities such as boating are popular these days.  People wax lyrical about the canals in France and elsewhere but we have our own set in beautiful countryside.This is a North-South project to which we are committed.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that the process has not come to a halt as we are preparing to go for planning permission.  The process is moving along but we must be mindful of the economic and financial constraints to which we are subject.  Nothing would give me greater pleasure than moving the project on.  I know the Minister is very interested in this because it was discussed about a fortnight ago in Armagh at the North-South ministerial gathering.  This is on the agenda and has not been put on the long finger.  The project will go for planning and I am confident we will see it completed, although I am not able to give a definite date for the Deputy.  I know how interested Deputies are in it.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I am glad it is progressing and we might have a date soon for completion, or even the beginning, of the project.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	448	As the Deputy is aware, the feasibility study referred to in her question is available on the website of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It was undertaken to assess the feasibility of locating the Abbey Theatre in the GPO.  The feasibility group included representatives of the Office of Public Works, the Abbey Theatre, An Post and the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The Deputy's question refers to the input into the group's work made by the Office of Public Works when it described the plans it had prepared in 2008.  Any proposals relating to the use of the GPO would be a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in consultation, as necessary, with the Office of Public Works.  The feasibility report found that although it would be technically feasible to relocate the Abbey Theatre to the GPO complex, it would be extremely difficult to complete the relocation in time for the 1916 centenary celebrations.  The GPO houses 960 staff of An Post which holds an exclusive lease of the complex until 2034 at an annual rent of €1.27 million.  The report estimated that the cost of the relocation of the Abbey Theatre to the GPO would be €293 million.  The estimate came with a caveat that several unknown factors could add significantly to that sum.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	449	Like the issue of the Moore Street monument, this matter arises again and again.  If one examines the questions tabled to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht since he took office, it is obvious that this subject is being raised frequently.  It is really in the hearts of the people.  It is in my heart also.  What provision has been made in the run-in to 2016 for the creation of a national monument incorporating the GPO, Moore Street, Moore Lane and O'Rahilly Parade?  Such a project would be very important in the context of the centenary celebrations in 2016.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I agree with the Deputy that this has been a long-running issue.  When I was my party's spokesman on the arts before the 2007 general election, where the Abbey Theatre would be located was a live issue.  It was suggested it could be moved to the GPO, the Carlton site or the docklands area.  A firm decision has been made that it will remain at its present location for the time being.  We must bear in mind that it would cost €293 million, a huge sum in these difficult economic times, to transfer the theatre to the GPO.  A cross-party committee, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, is examining what could be done to properly commemorate the centenary of the great events of 1916.  Not only was it a military affair, it was also a literary affair.  It was almost a poetic affair.  I am sure all the possibilities will be considered by the committee chaired by the Minister.  I am also sure it will be fittingly commemorated when the time comes and we are all looking forward to it.  I hope we will all be here.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	451	We really want to create a cultural area before 2016.

There was a strong connection between the 1916 Rising and culture, literature and the Irish language.  Many of the leaders of the rebellion were former members of Conradh na Gaeilge who met while they were involved in that organisation.  They played an important role.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, I hope the cross-party committee will recognise their contribution when the celebrations and commemorations are being planned.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I support Senator McLellan in this regard.  We accept the Minister of State's confirmation that the Abbey Theatre will not move to the GPO.  I join the Deputy in suggesting the Department and the OPW should consider locating a cultural centre in the GPO to celebrate the history of the building as the focal point of the 1916 Rising.  Many of our forefathers fought in GPO and its vicinity to secure the freedom of the country.  As we approach the centenary celebrations, the Department should carefully consider what can be done with that area of Dublin city.  I suggest it should develop a facility that could be used to celebrate the 1916 Rising, not only on a once-off basis but also by future generations.  We will have festivals and commemorations to celebrate the centenary, but we should also develop this historic building in order that it would become an ongoing tourist attraction in the heart of the city.  I ask the Department to revisit the matter with a view to putting something in place by 2016.

I agree with his depiction of the GPO as iconic.  People who visit Ireland make their way to it because it is almost like the Bastille in another country.  Previous commemorations were rather narrow and almost militaristic.  We have to widen our focus on this occasion by highlighting the significance of our culture, language and poetry.  I am confident that the committee chaired by the Minister will consider the views expressed here today.

Reáchtálfar próiseas comhairliúcháin phoiblí mar chuid den athbhreithniú seo agus rachfar i gcomhairle leis na páirtithe leasmhara cuí, Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga san áireamh.  Bheinn ag súil leis go dtógfar an cheist maidir le daoine atá ag iarraidh a n-ainmneacha, a sloinnte agus a seoltaí Gaeilge a úsáid agus iad i mbun gnóthaí le comhlachtaí poiblí san áireamh i gcomhthéacs an athbhreithnithe sin.  Maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge ar phas, tuigtear dom go ndaingnítear in alt 10 d'Acht na bPasanna 2008 na socruithe reachtúla a bhaineann le cúrsaí dá leithéid.  Ar ndóigh, is ar an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála atá an cúram reachtúil sa réimse sin.

Tá sé dochreidte sa bhliain 2011, beagnach 100 bliain níos déanaí, nach bhfuil daoine in ann a n-ainmneacha, a seoltaí agus a sloinnte a úsáid as Gaeilge más mian leo.  Is rud an-tábhachtach é do dhaoine.  Tá níos mó daoine ag iarraidh é a dhéanamh na laethanta seo.  Is minic a fheicim ainmneacha Gaeilge á úsáid ag daoine sna nuachtáin agus ar an teilifís.Cúpla seachtain ó shin, tháinig lead óg suas chugam agus bhí sé ag iarraidh pas a fháil.  Chuaigh  sé go hOifig na bPasanna agus dúirt an t-oifigeach leis go gcaithfeadh sé fianaise a thabhairt dó go raibh sé ag úsáid an fhoirm sin dá ainm ar feadh dhá bhliain.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cúrsaí slandála ag baint leis an rud seo ach, i ndáirire, tá bac curtha ar an lead sin chun a ainm a bheith i nGaeilge ar a phas.  Tá sé ró-óg chun bille leictreachais nó bille gáis a bheith aige.  Tá sé fós ina chónaí i dteach a thuistí.Ba cheart dúinn an ceart a thabhairt do gach uile dhuine sa tír a phas a fháil, b'fhéidir cosúil leis an slí ina n-oibríonn logainmneacha timpeall na tíre sa chaoi go bhfuil ceart ag daoine a seoladh Gaelach a úsáid.  Ba cheart dúinn an ceart a thabhairt do gach uile dhuine sa tír a pas a fháil, is cuma cén aois é nó í.

Ón eolas atá agam féin mar Theachta Dála, agus ag deighleáil le hiarratais ar phasanna do dhaoine ins an dáilcheantar, tá a fhios agam go gcothaíonn sé deacrachtaí agus go nglacann Oifig na bPasanna i láthair na huaire leis an ainm atá ar an teastais breithe.  Sílim gur sin an gnáth rud.  Má tá tú ag iarraidh, mar a dúirt an Teachta Tóibín, do ainm a athrúó Bhearla go Gaeilge, nóó Ghaeilge go Bearla, caithfidh tú cruthúnas a chur ar fáil go bhfuil tú ag baint úsáid go rialta as an leagan gur mhaith leat do phas a bheith ann.  Caithfear bille de chineál éigin a chur a fáil, b'fhéidir cuntas banc, cuntas aibhléise nó a leithéid sin.  Is cinnte go gcothaíonn sé deacrachtaí.  Silím féin go bhfuil sé réasúnta go leor má tá tú ag iarraidh do ainm a bheith ar do phas i nGaeilge nó i mBearla, go mbéifeá ábalta é sin a fháil.Ach é sin ráite, ar ndóigh, caithfidh Oifig na bPasana a bheith an-chúramach mar is rud an-luachmhar pas.  Má fhágann tú an tír agus gan an pas agat, is duine tú gan tír.  Ní saoránach de aon tír thú.  Mar sin, tá sé an-tábhachtach.  Tá a fhios againn go raibh deacracht le pasanna san am a chuaigh thart agus go raibh daoine ag taisteal thart i dtír sa Mheán Oirthear agus in áiteanna eile agus pasanna de chuid na hÉireann acu.  Tá sé an-dian ach, mar a dúirt mé, ní hionann sin agus a rá nach cóir go mbeadh an ceart sin ag daoine.Níor cuireadh aon fhoráil san Acht sa bhlian 2003 maidir le húsáid ainmneacha, sloinnte agus seolta i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla.  B'fhéidir gur síleadh ag an am gur ceart bunúsach a bhí anseo agus nach raibh gá le foráil reachtúil a dheanamh ina leith, ach bíonn deacrachtaí ann.  Tuigim ó Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga go bhfuil ós cionn 400 cás ann go ndearna daoine teagmháil leis an oifig ó bunaíodh í i 2004 maidir le fadhbanna a bhain le húsáid leaganacha Gaeilge de ainmneacha, sloinnte agus seolta.Mar sin, is cinnte go bhfuil deacracht ann.  Sílim go gcaithfidh muid gach iarracht a dhéanamh é a réiteach.  Dá mbeadh gach rud foirfe, dá mbeadh an saol foirfe, ba chóir go mbéifeá ábalta do phas a fháil san teaga ar rogha leat féin é ach, mar a dúirt mé, tá na deacrachtaí beaga sin ann chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le pas mar gur doiciméad chomh luachmhar agus chomh tábhachtach sin é.

Is rud an-tábhachtach é.Freisin, tá daoine ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht atá ag iarraidh seirbhísí a fháil ó chomhlachtaí poiblí trí Ghaeilge agus fós tá ag teip ar na comhlachtaí sin na seirbhísí sin a fheidhmiú trí Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart go mbeadh seirbhísí ar chomh-caighdeán le seirbhísí as Béarla sa Ghaeltacht.  Má táimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú, caithfidh go mbeidh na seirbhísí á fheabhsú ag an Ríaltas seo.Tá fadhb eile ann freisin.  Bhíos ag caint le duine cúpla lá ó shin mar gheall ar Chomhairle na nEalaíon.  An bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil an chomhairle ag obair le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus tá chomh-mhaoiniú le déanamh ag an údaras?  Chuala mé go ndúirt an t-Aire Stáit go mbeadh sé in ann an scéal sin a shocrú.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach cathain a mbeidh sé in ann an scéal sin a shocrú?

Má tá tú ag plé le Roinn nó le comhlacht Stáit, tá sé de cheart agat seirbhís a fháil i nGaeilge.  Ar ndóigh, ba chóir go mbeadh sé le fáil ins na ceantair Gaeltachta, níl dabht faoi sin.  Sin mar is ceart é a bheith.Maidir le mo chontae fhéin, más féidir liom a bheith réigiúnach ar feadh tamaill, tá dílárnú déanta ar na hoifigí ag an chomhairle chontae i mo chontae fhéin.  Ins an chomhairle chontae, agus go speisialta sna ceantair Gaeltachta, is féidir leat do ghnó a dhéanamh i nGaeilge nó i mBéarla.  Sílim gur dul chun cinn é sin.  Sílim gur sampla é sin den rud gur féidir a dhéanamh ar fud na tíre.Ar an bpointe eile a bhí ag an Teachta maidir le hEalaín na Gaeltachta, sílim go bhfuil an-obair á dhéanamh ag Ealaín na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go bhfaigheann siad €425,000 sa bhliain ó Údaras na Gaeltachta.  Tá siad ag gníomhú ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Mar a dúirt mé, bhí mé ag roinnt imeachtaí a rinne Ealaín na Gaeltachta airgeadú orthu le cúpla seachtain anuas.  Tá comhráití ag dul ar aghaidh i láthair na huaire agus tá mise ag tnúth go mór go mbeadh socrú gan mhoill sa dóigh gur féidir le hEalaín na Gaeltachta leanúint ar aghaidh ag tabhairt tacaíochta, chomhairle agus cuidiú do na ealaíontóirí agus na grúpaí atá ag cur ealaíne agus obair chruthaitheach ar fáil ar fud na gceantar Gaeltachta ar fad.Tuigim go bhfuil na comhráití ar siúl.  Níl a fhíos agam an bhfuil cinneadh nó an bhfuil réiteach air go fóill, ach tá súil agam.  Déarfaidh mé seo mar Aire Stáit, nach fada gombeidh.

An slí is fearr leis an rud seo a réiteach maidir le seirbhísí a chur ar fáil ag na comhlachtaí poiblí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná an córas earcaíochta a fheabhsú chun go mbeadh daoine le Gaeilge ag obair iontu.  Sa slí sin ní bheadh aon chostas níos mó ag an Rialtas chun na seirbhísí a chur ar fáil.

Is cinnte go gcaithfear tabhairt faoin fhadhb sin agus go gcaithfidh na daoine a bheidh ansin a bheith ábalta an seirbhís a chur ar fáil.Tá an Stát ag tabhairt tacaíochta don iarracht seo mar bíonn liúntas speisíalta le fáil ar sheirbhísí poiblí a dheanann freastal ar cheantair Ghaeltachta.  Má tá liúntas speisíalta á dhíol ba cheart go mbeadh sé ar chumas na ndaoine atá fostaithe ag an Stát nó ag chomhlachtaí Stáit ins na Gaeltachtaí an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge.  Mar a dúirt mé, is páirt den straitéis é agus má tá deacrachtaí agus laigí ann, chaithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt orthu agus iad a chur i gceart.  Déanfaimid é sna fiche bliain amach romhainn.  Tá stráitéis 20 bliain ann.  Ach táimid ag ullmhú plean bliana i láthair na huaire agus táimid ag ullmhú plean trí bliana, agus caithfear aghaidh a thabhairt ar an fhadhb sin aon áit a bhfuil deacrachtaí.  Cuirtear in iúil don gCoimisinéir Teanga go bhfuil deacrachtaí.  Cuireann an Coimisinéir Teanga amach a chuid tuairiscí.  Sílim go gcaithfimid aird a thabhairt air.  Ach táimid dáirire faoin stráitéis.

Is féidir linn go léir nod a thabhairt do na pleananna atá déanta ag an Rialtas atá thart, ach ní leor dúinn na pleananna agus caithfimid rudaí a dhéanamh anois.

Caithfidh gach ceantar agus pobal Gaeltachta plean forbartha teanga a chur ar fáil.  Má dhéanann siad é sin, is féidir iad a aithint.  Beidh dhá bhliain acu chun an plean forbartha a dhéanamh agus ansin déanfar measúnú air, b'fhéidir thar cúig bliana nó seacht mbliana.  Mar adúirt mé sa fhreagra, i láthair na huaire tá na ceantair Ghaeltachta bunaithe ar cheantair tíreolaíochta.  Ó seo amach — nuair a rachaidh an Bille Gaeltachta tríd an Oireachtas — beidh na ceantair Ghaeltachta bunaithe ar an teanga agus ar chumas na ndaoine sna ceantair an teanga a labhairt.  Beidh sí teanga-bhunaithe, ní ar bhonn tíreolaíochta.  Má bhíonn ceantar ar bith, nach bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht i láthair na huaire, sásta a rá go mba mhaith leis go mbeadh na seirbhísí sa cheantar sin trí Ghaeilge mar go bhfuil pobal Gaeltachta ann, d'fhéadfadh an pobal sin plean a chur ar aghaidh.  Measófar an plean sin agus ansin, is féidir an ceantar a ghlacadh isteach sna gréasáin Ghaeltachta atá luaite go sonrach sa straitéis 20 bliain.  Is cinnte gur dúshlán mór é, ach beidh deis ag ceantair é sin a dhéanamh.Mar shampla, tá ceantar i nDoire a bhuaigh comórtas Glór na nGael ag a bhfuil dul chun cinn iontach déanta aige.  D'fhéadfaí a rá gur Gaeltacht atá ann, i gContae Doire.  Sampla é sin den rud gur féidir a dhéanamh.  Bheinn ag súil, nuair a bheidh an Bille tríd, i gceann cúpla bliain go mbeidh an Ghaeltacht níos leithne ná mar atá sí anois, agus go mbeidh ceantair bheaga Gaeltachta anseo agus ansiúd, áiteanna ina mbeidh corpus sonrach de chainteoirí a úsáideann an Ghaeilge ó lá go lá, b'fhéidir gaelscoil, gaelcholáistí, seirbhísí eaglaise agus seirbhísí eile.  Cén fáth go gcuirfeadh muid teorainneacha le leathnú na Gaeltachta?

Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil Aire speisialta ceaptha ag an Rialtas chun cúramaí linbh agus páistí a chomhlíonadh.  Tá Bille á n-ullmhú a thabharfaidh stádas reachtúil do chosaint páistí.

Mar gheall ar seo, ní bheidh na figiúirí maidir leis an líon post atá cruthaithe nó caillte i 2011 ar fáil go dtí go bhfoilseofar torthaí an chéad suirbhé eile go luath i 2012.  Tá briseadh síos ar bhuiséad an údaráis do na blianta 2008 go 2011 léirithe sa tábla atá ceangailte leis an bhfreagra seo.  Chomh maith leis an maoiniú a fhaigheann an t-údarás ón Státchiste, ní miste a lua go mbíonn teacht isteach ag an údarás ó fhoinsí eile, mar shampla ioncam ó dhíol sócmhainní agus scaireanna agus ioncam ó léasanna agus ó chíosanna.2008 € ’0002009 € ’000*2010 € ’000*2011 € ’000Ioncam ón Stát44,05437,63532,91519,650Ioncam ó dhíol sócmhainní6,1642,2722,9707,500Ioncam eile8,21811,3807,7836,730Iomlán58,43651,28743,66833,880* Figiúirí meastaNíl de rogha ag an Rialtas, mar gheall ar chúinsí eacnamaíocha reatha, ach féachaint go géar ar gach uile líne caiteachais Stáit faoin athbhreithniú cuimsitheach caiteachais atá ar siúl i láthair na huaire.  Is sa chomhthéacs sin, agus i gcomhthéacs an phróisis mheastachán, a dhéanfar cinntí sonracha maidir leis an soláthar a bheidh ar fáil don údarás ón Státchiste i 2012 agus na blianta ina dhiaidh sin.  É sin ráite, aithním go maith na deacrachtaí atá cruthaithe d'Údarás na Gaeltachta mar gheall ar chinneadh an Rialtais dheireanaigh an soláthar airgid caipitil ón Státchiste a laghdú ó €18 milliún i 2010 go €6 mhilliún i 2011.  Mar is eol don Teach, thóg an Rialtas cinntí sonracha polasaí i mí na Bealtaine maidir le struchtúr agus feidhmeanna Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar thoradh ar na cinntí sin, tá sé i gceist go mbeidh cumhacht reachtúil ag an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta treoir a thabhairt don údarás a chuid acmhainní teoranta a dhíriú i dtreo earnálacha fiontraíochta ar leith.  Chomh maith leis sin, déanfar meicníocht a fhorbairt chun go mbeidh an t-údarás in ann comhoibriú le háisíneachtaí forbartha Stáit eile i gcás tionscadail shuntasacha Ghaeltachta a bhfuil poitéinseal ard ag baint leo.  Mar thoradh ar an gcur chuige seo, táthar ag súil go mbeidh an luach is fearr ar airgead, agus an toradh is fearr fostaíochta ann don Ghaeltacht, ó na hacmhainní teoranta atá ar fáil don Stát san aeráid eacnamaíochta reatha.

D'úsáideadh an t-airgead caipitil sin chun fostaíocht, monarchana agus tionsclaíocht a bhunú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Thit an figiúr sin go dtí €16 milliún, go dtí €10 milliún agus ar deireadh go dtí €6 mhilliún i mbliana.  Is féidir a rá, dá bhrí sin, go bhfuil géarchéim airgeadais ag an údarás i láthair na huaire, chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an deontas caipitil.  Tá obair iontach déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá breis agus 7,000 duine ag obair i gceantair Ghaeltachta ó Dhún na nGall go Ciarraí agus Corcaigh, agus ó Chontae Phort Láirge go Contae na Mí——

Beimid ag lorg an oiread airgid agus acmhainní agus is féidir a fháil.  Ní féidir linn an chluas bhodhar, nó an súil dall, a thabhairt don aeráid eacnamaíochta atá againn faoi láthair.  Déanfaimid ár ndícheall oiread agus is féidir a dhéanamh ionas gur féidir leis an údarás leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair iontach atá ar siúl acu.  Tá na Meastúcháin á phlé againn faoi láthair.  Nuair a thiocfaidh an cáinfhaisnéis amach roimh deireadh na bliana, beidh a fhios againn go díreach cad a bheidh ar fáil.  Mar duine ón nGaeltacht, tá a fhios agam go gcaithfimid gach rud is féidir a dhéanamh chun cúnamh a thabhairt don údarás.  Tuigeann an Teachta Ó Ceit agus na Teachtaí eile atá i láthair an tábhacht leis an méid sin.  Bhí an t-údarás in ann acmhainní a dhíol agus breis airgid a fháil i mbliana.  Gan é sin, bheadh an cás go dona ar fad.  Beidh deis acu é sin a dhéanamh sna blianta atá amach romhainn chomh maith.

Mar shampla, sa bhliain 2008 cuireadh iomlán de €58.5 milliúin ar fáil.  I mbliana, cuireadh €33.8 milliúin ar fáil.  Is mór an titim é sin.  Sin an t-iomlán den deontas caipitil agus den deontas reatha.  Is é an ceann is tromchúisí ar fad ná an deontas caipitil de €6 mhilliúin.  Is cinnte go gcuireann sin laincis ar an údarás.Ta polasaithe fostaíochta ag an Rialtas.  Tá beagnach 500,000 duine dí-fhostaithe agus táimid ag iarraidh an figiúr sin a ísliú.  Tá mise dóchasach, ó na cainteanna a bhí agam le hAirí, má thagann éinne chun tosaigh agus scéim aige le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil ins an Ghaeltacht go mbeidh tacaíocht, comhairle agus gach cuidiú le fáil ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá dí-fhostaíocht ar fud na tíre agus sa Ghaeltacht féin.  Tá sé iontach tábhachtach go mbeadh daoine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht.  Muna bhfuil fostaíocht ní bheidh daoine agus muna bhfuil daoine ní bheidh teanga.  Tá siad uilig ag brath ar a chéile.Déanfaimid ár ndícheall chun fostaíocht a chothú, ach ní féidir linn dearmad a dhéanamh ar an ghanntanas airgid agus ar an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta.  Tá foinsí féin ag an Teachta maidir le díol ar ais iasachtaí agus mar sin.  Sílim go bhfuil sé socraithe ag muintir na tíre an treo a bhfuilimid ag dul.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	505	Today is an important day for this country, on which it is being represented by its Taoiseach in Brussels.  He is one of the Heads of State or Government of 27 nations who convene in Brussels to address the European euro, banking and fiscal crises.  The severe symptoms presented themselves in the five countries known as the PIIGS, namely, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.  Ireland completed its quarterly review under the EU-IMF support programme only last week and received good marks across all the boxes.  Ireland has reached the targets of fiscal correction and reform to the extent this now is under way.  Earlier today, the Dáil completed the Second Stage debate on the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill, which will now proceed to Committee Stage.  This shows that discipline is returning to Ireland's fiscal affairs following the change of government.As part of the support programme, Ireland faces the imminent €19 billion recapitalisation of the banks.  Because a critical point has been reached in respect of Europe's addressing European problems with a European solution, it may be timely to pause, reflect and consider the implications of the €19 billion recapitalisation as laid out in the EU-IMF-ECB agreement.  When that agreement was signed in November 2010, there was an extremely poor understanding of the amount of losses that had occurred in the Irish banking system.  It was only as recently as the end of March, following completion of the prudential capital assessment review, that the enormity and scale of the losses was determined at approximately €70 billion.  Some people, including myself when I put on my accountancy and banking and finance hats, consider that figure possibly to be on the short side.  The reason this is important in the context of the €19 billion recapitalisation concerns the funding of our banking system and our banks, which are being coalesced into two pillar banks, leaving aside the banks for resolution, namely, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank.  It is because the original six banks, now merging into two, owe obligations of approximately €150 billion to the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland, which is proxy for the ECB.  Included in the aforementioned €150 billion is approximately €70 billion that has its provenance from the redemption in full of senior bondholders up the end of last year, during the course of 12 months when there had not been an admission or a recognition of the scale of loan losses in the banking system.  Consequently, by default or by a lack of proper understanding or perhaps by design but as a matter of fact, €70 billion within the €150 billion funding the banks through the ECB derived from redemption of senior bondholders.Capitalisation of a banking system can happen by direct capital injection, of which, within the €19 billion, €10 billion will come from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  However, it may be timely to reconsider whether it might be better to present an insistent and persistent case to the ECB that a write-down of debt owed to the ECB could be negotiated.This is in addition to what we have all heard about an interest rate reduction on the support funds being advanced by the eurofunds.Since negotiations with Europe and the ECB are ongoing it would be very important to be able to achieve a change in the capitalisation strategy in order to preserve that €10 billion of cash in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to be used as a cushion for the fiscal adjustments over the next four years under the relief programme of €50 billion.  This would be very important because a creditor write-down of €50 billion from the ECB, €25 billion from the private creditors of bondholders and pro-note holders, could, in turn, be passed on to the customers of banks in the form of households and businesses, which would relieve customers, households and businesses, hugely.  This would also create a stimulus to the economy which would get the real economy moving again.

We all recognise his expertise in these matters since he became a Member of the House and before.In recent months the Department of Finance and the banking unit of the NTMA have been working hard to ensure that our commitments on recapitalising our banks are met by the appropriate deadline which is 31 July 2011.  Given that the last day of this month is a Sunday, in practical terms this means having this work completed by Friday next, 29 July 2011.The House will know that the stress tests announced last March by the Central Bank determined that our banks required another €24 billion of capital to meet their new regulatory requirements.  The Government indicated at the time that a significant portion of this amount  — at least €5 billion — would come from private sources as result of liability management exercises with junior bondholders.The Minister for Finance confirms that well in excess of €4 billion of such burden-sharing has been achieved with holders of subordinated bonds and we are well on track to reach the aforementioned target of €5 billion.  This leaves a sum of up to €19 billion which must be largely met by the taxpayer.  I will update the House on where we stand with regard to this investment.Allied Irish Banks merged with the EBS on Friday, 1 July 2011 and the recapitalisation plan for the combined entity was announced the same day.  The combined capital requirements of the two institutions are €14.8 billion.  Under the plan, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission will inject €5 billion in equity capital at a price of 1 cent per share, bringing its shareholding to 99.8%.  The State will also inject €1.6 billion in contingent capital.  Following the imminent completion of burden-sharing with subordinated debt-holders, which is expected to generate a total capital gain in the region of €2 billion, the remaining capital requirements will be met by way of a capital contribution.  An extraordinary general meeting to approve the capital raising is scheduled for 26 July and the funds are expected to be injected shortly afterwards.The recapitalisation plan for Irish Life & Permanent was put forward by the board to shareholders of the institution yesterday and was rejected.  Under the plan, the Minister for Finance was to subscribe for €2.3 billion of equity at a price of 6.3 cent which was a 10% discount to the market price on 23 June.  This would have given the State a shareholding of 99.2%.  The Minister was also to contribute contingent capital of €0.4 billion.  The balance of the bank's PCAR requirement was to be made up of €200 million from internal resources, and an estimated €1.1 billion from the combined benefits of the bank's liability management exercises and the disposal of Irish Life.  Following the rejection of these proposals by shareholders, the Minister for Finance intends to review the options open to him in light of our imminent obligations both to the Central Bank and the external partners.In the case of Bank of Ireland, of its €4.2 billion capital requirement, just under €2 billion has to date been achieved through a liability management exercise.  A rights issue is currently under way to raise circa €1.9 billion and this is fully underwritten by the NPRFC at a price of 10 cent per share.  The balance of the PCAR requirement will be made up of contingent capital of €l billion, for which the Minister for Finance will subscribe and further burden-sharing measures linked to the remaining junior debt outstanding.  Depending on how the take-up goes in the rights issue and assuming no other third party takes up the shares in the bank, the State's shareholding will end up anywhere between 29.2% and 69.7% in the bank compared to 36% today.The House will be aware that the state of bank balance sheets is not just a topical subject in this jurisdiction.  The issue has been debated extensively across Europe and indeed beyond.  The recently announced European stress tests were specifically designed to address concerns that European banks were under-capitalised in light of current economic conditions and market circumstances.  In the end, only eight banks were found to have a capital need under the test with the combined shortfall identified as being €2.5 billion.  However, it is acknowledged that had it not been for the €50 billion in equity capital that was raised by European banks earlier this year, the tests would have identified a far bigger requirement.  Our banks passed the EBA stress test as we had moved early to analyse the banks' books in great detail, using a level of granularity far beyond what was involved in the European tests.The EBA methodology included a number of differences relative to that applied in the recent PCAR exercise.  The PCAR was tailored specifically to the Irish banks' need to reduce their reliance on external funding over the coming three years, while the EU-wide test looks at the resilience of the largest European banks against a set of more widely applicable adverse circumstances.The EBA stress test set a 5% core tier 1 capital requirement in the stress scenario, while a level of 6% was applied in PCAR.  The PCAR was applied on a three year horizon from 2011-2013 compared to the two year 2011-2012 timeline applied by the EBA.  There were also significant differences in the application of future changes in the balance sheet; application of funding constraints and treatment of sovereign and bank credit losses.  Loan losses independently forecast by BlackRock Solutions as part of the PCAR were also applied to Irish banks participating in the EU-wide stress test.In summary once our recapitalisation and indeed restructuring commitments are met by amounts which are clearly within the envelope of the external authorities funding programme, Irish banks will be among the best capitalised banks in Europe and in a far stronger position to return to the markets for funding and to meet the needs of the Irish economy.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I raise this issue which is very important to ratepayers the length and breadth of the country and not just to those of County Westmeath or County Longford.  As recently as a number of weeks ago, a group has formed called, Employers for Affordable Rates.  This group is initiating a campaign to lobby the Government to introduce new measures.  By the time the House returns in September, the debate will have started at a local level when it comes to the setting of the county council annual rates.  There is a misconception that a reduction of 1% to 4% in the county council rates would benefit businesses but this will not benefit small businesses.  The only people to benefit will be large multinational companies.The method of funding for local authorities needs to be examined.  The business community requires a more fair and equitable system.  We all know that local authorities are obliged by law to levy rates on commercial properties which have been entered in the valuation list by the independent Commissioner of Valuation.  At present this system is draconian, inequitable and unfair.  The valuation list used for almost all of Ireland is based on the Griffith valuation carried out in the 19th century.  Maintaining these lists requires the Valuation Office to determine valuations by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.  The result is a list of valuations that bears no resemblance to modern valuation levels and contains many anomalies.The Valuation Office is currently revaluing all commercial properties in Ireland based on the rental value in 2005.  We all know that today's economic circumstances are substantially different from those of 2005.  The figures are totally out of date and the office has only revalued three rating authorities out of a total of 88.  Even if it was revaluing to a realistic figure, how long would it take for it to get through the remaining 85 rating authorities?We are in an awful situation.  Businesses are on the brink and if they are not closing they are laying off staff in order just to pay the rates.  Even in 2009 local authorities were only able to collect 80% of the rates.  Businesses are reducing staff to pay rates which means more people are going on the live register.  For our economic recovery we need more competitive businesses to create jobs.  When we return after the summer recess the Government should introduce an amendment to the Valuation Act so that businesses that are struggling can appeal the level of rates they are being charged.  At the moment the local authority has no facility to negotiate with the ratepayer so it is all or nothing.  If a business goes out of business, it does not need to pay any rates.  However, it might just need a helping hand to reduce the rates somewhat in order to stay in business.I am disappointed the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is not here for this debate.  We also need to set up a review group to consider how we fund local authorities.  It is unfair that the entire burden is placed on businesses.  We need more sustainable businesses with more sustainable jobs and more people paying into the Exchequer and fewer people on the dole.  In addition, if the high streets are full of cars even the local authorities are benefiting from car parking charges so it is a win-win situation.  This is a very important issue for the business community and everybody benefits when we have job creation.The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government needs to consider how we can amend the present system.  I have spoken to a number of businesspeople in my constituency who have suggestions to make.  We could charge based on a company's turnover and require the company to submit its VAT returns on a bimonthly basis.  People are willing to give their advice and the benefit of their expertise.  We know a charge needs to be paid but we need to ensure it is fairer and more equitable.This is the last Adjournment Debate, so we are entering the history books.

#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	510	We might get a footnote in history yet.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which is of interest to so many businesses and commercial interests in every part of the country.  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, water, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.The factors that influence the decision on the annual rate on valuation include the level of services to be provided by the local authority and the income available to fund these services.  The elected members therefore adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the range of services for the communities, including businesses, in their area.  In this regard, all rates collected locally are spent exclusively on providing services within that area.  This is local democracy in action.The Government is acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses and the challenging economic environment in which many property and business owners are operating at the present time.  Local authorities have responded positively to requests to them by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to exercise restraint in setting commercial rates to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities.  The annual rates on valuation have been reduced by an average of 0.6% in 2010 and by a similar level in 2011.It is recognised that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review.  The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.  To date revaluations have been completed in the South Dublin, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas.  A revaluation is currently under way in the Dublin City Council area.  It is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas later this year.Following completion of the revaluation programme, there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Valuation Act.  In this way, the revaluation process will lead to more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and will assist in making the rating system fairer and equitable for ratepayers.  I understand that the Commissioner of Valuation is actively reviewing options which might facilitate the delivery of the revaluation programme within a shorter timeframe.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I also thank the Minister of State for his attendance to reply.  A firm in my constituency, Simmonstown Stud, Celbridge, County Kildare, owing to a change in operational procedures found it necessary to make a number of employees redundant.  These employees were accommodated on site in what are known as tied houses.  In other words, on foot of their terms of employment they had a house for the duration of their employment.  We fully respect the right of the employer to change his or her operational procedures.  There is no dispute as to whether the employees in this situation have to leave; we know they have to leave and find alternative accommodation.  The problem lies with the length of time it takes to find alternative accommodation in the present climate.A group of people comprising approximately half a dozen families who have lived and in some cases given up to 20 years service to their employer now find themselves, having been made redundant, also homeless.  In different times it would have been possible to rehouse them through the local authority.  However, Kildare County Council has 6,500 families on its housing list and there is no possibility of them being rehoused quickly.  It must be done through a process of negotiation between the housing authority and potential tenants.  Problematically, the agent for the employer is unwilling to listen to reason and, according to the tenants, is proceeding to hassle and intimidate them into clearing out of the houses and giving the firm vacant possession.  While it is undoubtedly entitled to vacant possession, the manner in which this is being achieved leaves a great deal to be desired.  In these enlightened times when we are more conscious than ever of the need to be fair to everyone and of the rights and wrongs of events, everyone, including those in a position to do so, should recognise that individuals not in such advantageous positions should be accommodated.  We should also recognise the vulnerability of the families concerned and give them reasonable time to find alternative accommodation.The theory is that, when someone is made redundant, he or she will receive a redundancy payment, as will be the case in this instance.  The theory is also that people should be able to use their redundancy payments to house themselves.  However, this stretches the imagination quite a bit.  As we all know, it is not possible to do so, even with today's lower house prices.  If necessary, the law should be changed to ensure that, in circumstances such as the one I have outlined, sufficient time is given to enable negotiations to take place and allow people to acquire alternative housing.  Having given up to a quarter of a century of service to a particular employer in many cases, the people concerned should not need to use their redundancy payments to rent accommodation in an emergency.These were the conditions of the time and, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I know well, operating under such guidelines was beneficial to all concerned.  There have been many such cases.  In most, both sides are willing to accommodate each other.  In this case, the tenants, for want of a better description, are willing to accommodate their former employer by vacating the properties as quickly as possible.  In such circumstances, there must be recognition of the fact that people need a little extra time, particularly in the current economic climate.  If the legislation does not allow for this, it should be changed.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and thank the Deputy for raising it.  He has asked that the Government consider the need to amend or introduce legislation to ensure employees who have been provided with accommodation by their employers as part of their terms and conditions are given adequate time to secure alternative accommodation on their retirement, dismissal or redundancy, with particular reference to the latter and the need to prevent homelessness.  In proposing such a legislative approach he has referred to an individual case in which employees who have resided for up to 20 years in accommodation provided on site by their employer on foot of a caretaker agreement have been unable to find alternative housing accommodation in the time since being made redundant.  I am not aware of the specific details of the case, but it is clearly a matter of concern and I can appreciate the difficulties that might be caused for persons who find themselves in such an unfortunate position.In effect, the Deputy is suggesting there might be a need to amend or introduce legislation to provide for an appropriate adjustment period for such persons.  At issue, for example, could be an extension of the current minimum notice period to allow for a period of further adjustment by employees post-employment.  The Deputy will be aware that dedicated legislation providing for minimum notice entitlements is in place, namely, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001.  The terms of the legislation specifically provide for a range of minimum notice periods to apply, the length of which relates to the period of employment of the employee concerned.  The basic entitlement is a minimum of one week's notice.  Persons with more than 15 years employment experience are entitled to eight weeks minimum notice.  The Acts do not prevent an employee from waiving his or her right to notice or accepting payment in lieu of notice.  On the basis that the employees to whom the Deputy refers were in employment for some 20 years, they would be entitled to this minimum notice period.  If their contract of employment provided for longer periods of notice than the statutory minimum period, the longer notice periods would apply under contract law.  There is nothing to prevent an employer and an employee from agreeing to include accommodation terms in an employment contract.  For statutory entitlements, employees can vindicate their rights through the normal dispute settlement bodies.  For other non-statutory contractual terms in general, where disputes arise, they may need to be pursued under contract law through the courts.If it is the contention of the Deputy that such minimum notice periods provided for in extant legislation should be increased to allow a sufficient adjustment period for persons to secure alternative accommodation, where there is a caretaker agreement, post-employment, I cannot support such an approach.  In the first instance, it would not be feasible to apply such additional obligations on employers in these challenging economic times.  To do so would not only have a detrimental impact on individual employers, it could also affect sectors of the economy in such a way as to be detrimental to maintaining and growing employment.  It would have significant and wide-ranging implications across the economy generally and potentially for a range of employers and employments.  In current circumstances where businesses are struggling to remain competitive and contain costs, we must maintain a strong degree of balance and cannot impose on employers additional costs associated with new obligations post-employment where persons are retired, dismissed or redundant and where the normal contracts of employment have been terminated.  I note that the Deputy has indicated that the accommodation provided in this specific case was provided by the previous employer on foot of a caretaker agreement for persons who are now redundant and where there is no longer a contract of employment in place.Matters concerned with landlord and tenant law are ones for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I understand there is in train a reform of such law, with proposals being circulated on these matters.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 405 together.One of this Government's top priorities from its first day in office has been the rebuilding of Ireland's international reputation.  In doing this, we need to promote all of our key strengths as a country.  Irish culture has a global reach, and the worldwide recognition of Ireland's great artists, writers and musicians of past and present is more important now than ever before in projecting Ireland's profile as a creative nation.  It is also our most powerful connection to the 70 million members of the global Irish community.To give effect to the Government's objectives to strengthen Ireland's global reputation and cultural profile, Culture Ireland, as part of my Department, promotes Irish arts in key territories worldwide, working very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its mission network, the Department of the Taoiseach, and with the other promotional agencies.  This year in particular, Culture Ireland is spearheading Imagine Ireland, a special initiative to promote Irish arts in America, comprising more than 1,000 Irish artists in more than 400 events across more than 40 US States.I am confident that these measures and initiatives will contribute substantively to sustainable economic recovery.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 18 together.As the Deputies may be aware, major building works are underway at the National Gallery of Ireland.  The works are necessary to address the deterioration in the fabric of the historic Dargan and Milltown Wings of the Gallery, which are respectively 150 and 100 plus years old, and to upgrade plant and services to deliver a secure and stable environment for its priceless collections.Regarding the public private partnership project for the National Concert Hall, it was decided in late 2010 not to proceed with the project as originally envisaged, given the current economic situation.   A range of rehabilitation and refurbishment issues still remain, however, and will be examined in light of available resources.Turning to the Abbey Theatre, following consideration of the matter by the Government, it has been decided not to proceed with the re-location of the Abbey Theatre to the GPO complex. I will, however, endeavour to ensure that the Abbey Theatre's accommodation in its current location is maintained to a suitable standard. The intervention made a number of years ago in the Abbey auditorium was an excellent one and ongoing investment there has addressed front-of-house, box-office, staging and mechanical issues.With regard to the National Museum, the Asgard will be placed on display at the Collins Barracks and minor capital works to allow for public access to it will commence shortly.Regarding the Irish Museum of Modern Art, capital works to address essential upgrades to the fire and electrical systems amongst other things will have to be carried out at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham in the near future and this will necessitate the temporary closure of parts of the Museum.I am conscious that the severe economic downturn has had an impact on some of the capital development plans of the national cultural institutions.  The institutions, while forming an intrinsic part of our heritage, also remain an important part of our cultural tourism offering and I will continue to support them to the greatest extent possible, within the available resources.

Under the Act, planning authorities have a clear obligation to create a record of protected structures.There are 2,908 monuments recorded in the Register of Historic Monuments and there are approximately 120,000 further monuments recorded in the Record of Monuments and Places and these are protected under the National Monuments Acts.  Both the Record and the Register are maintained by my Department. There are 757 national monument sites in my ownership or guardianship — the number of individual monuments is greater as some of these sites contain a number of monuments. There are 490 national monuments protected by Preservation Orders. Currently, there are no monuments subject to temporary preservation orders and there are no preservation orders pending. While a breakdown by county is not readily available across this very large number of sites, a considerable amount of detail is contained on my Department's website at www.archaeology.ie.Sites designated by my Department for their natural heritage interest include 423 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), 153 Special Protection Areas (SPAs), 155 Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs), 7 Refuges for Fauna, 78 Nature Reserves and 6 National Parks.  Detailed information on these sites, including information on the nature conservation associated with each, is available on a county basis on the National Parks and Wildlife Service website at www.npws.ie.The number of heritage sites that are not currently protected is not easily defined.  New research, surveys and inventories inform where and what protection is offered.  Other factors include refinements to the extent of a site boundary, changes to its qualifying interests and the relationship of the individual elements of the site — they may enjoy protection as a group or individually.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme pays farmers based in the Shannon Callows to maintain meadows suitable for the breeding requirements of the corncrake. A new pilot scheme is being proposed on the Mullet Peninsula in Mayo and the North Coast of Donegal, designed to help maintain or restore the favourable conservation status of these Special Protection Areas (SPAs). Furthermore, the NPWS leases land under Conacre to facilitate longer term management where corncrakes have been present in recent years.The current payments offer good value to the farmer and the schemes have a high rate of take up in the relevant areas.

The Programme for Government proposed making Culture Night a twice yearly event.  Discussions on the most appropriate way to build on the success of the Culture Night event are ongoing.  As such there may be scope for the development of an audience-focused cultural initiative as part of these festivities.The Deputy will appreciate that these discussions must have regard to the resources available to my Department and to the many competing demands on these resources.It is likely that reduced resources will mean that my priorities will not permit such a wide ranging proposal as put forward by the Deputy.

Under the section 24 of the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is independent in its decisions on funding, including the selection of initiatives and the level of funding. I intend, however, to convey the commitment on touring to the Arts Council in a manner which is appropriate to our respective statutory remits.

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of €35m. However, Government Accounting procedures do not provide, in that sense, for the "ring-fencing" of funds for projects of this nature and I can confirm that this funding was not included in any budget between 2008 to 2010.I am advised that it was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets. I am advised also that it was also a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets — a scenario that was affected negatively by the economic downturn.Clearly, that downturn is of major significance and presents serious difficulties to my Department during this period when there is such pressure on the public finances. While I intend to explore all possible options that may assist in the advancement of this project, it must also be recognised that the Government is engaged at present in a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, under which all spending is being examined rigorously. Notwithstanding that, I have asked my Department to keep in regular contact with Waterways Ireland with a view to advancing the project to the extent possible, within the current constraints. In this regard, you will be aware that Waterways Ireland is in the process of finalising documentation in order to proceed to the stage of submitting an application for planning permission — a significant milestone for the project.

On 27 April, Mr Neil Hughes of Hughes Blake was appointed receiver and manager by Bord Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board and The Arts Council, with the agreement of my Department.The receiver sought expressions of interest in taking over the management and running of the Light House Cinema by placing advertisements in the national media. I understand that there were a number of enquiries from interested parties in response to the advertisements and that discussions are ongoing between those parties, the receiver and the landlord.Under the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.

Tá Aonad Straitéise bunaithe i mo Roinn atá freagrach as pleanáil agus feidhmiú na Straitéise a threorú. Tá plean forfheidhmithe bliana agus trí bliana do chur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise ag mo Roinn ullmhaithe ag an Aonad Straitéise. Tá an tAonad Straitéise ag dul i ndáil chomhairle leis na príomhpháirtithe leasmhara eile faoin Straitéis chun a gcuid pleananna forfheidhmithe siúd a lorg fosta. Feictear dom go mbeadh sé cuí agus cóir go bhfoilseofaí na pleananna forfheidhmithe seo in am tráth ar líne sa chaoi is go mbeadh rochtain éasca orthu.Tá trí ghrúpa oibre ardleibhéil bunaithe ag an Aonad Straitéise chun dlús a chur le forfheidhmiú na Straitéise. I bhfianaise an tábhacht ar leith a bhaineann le réimse gnímh an oideachais faoin Straitéis, tá grúpa oibre ardleibhéil bunaithe idir oifigigh ó mo Roinn agus oifigigh ón Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna. Bhí dhá chruinniú ag an ngrúpa oibre seo go dtí seo i mbliana agus tá tús áite á thabhairt do na tosaíochtaí maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise i réimse gnímh an oideachais, ag tógáil san áireamh na laincisí ar acmhainní i láthair na huaire.Tá grúpa oibre ardleibhéil eile bunaithe idir oifigigh ó mo Roinn, ó Fhoras na Gaeilge agus ó Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá an grúpa seo dírithe ach go háirithe ar idirdhealú a dhéanamh idir feidhmeanna reachtúla na Roinne, an Fhorais agus an Údaráis sa chaoi is gur féidir a chinntiú go mbeidh an luach is fearr ar airgead ag an Státchiste agus nach mbeidh aon dúbláil soláthair ann mar thoradh ar chur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise ag na comhlachtaí poiblí seo.

Déanfar forálacha faoin mBille Gaeltachta do na struchtúir fhorfheidhmithe faoin Straitéis, de réir mar is cuí, agus don sainmhíniú úr ar an nGaeltacht.Mar aitheantas ar an mborradh atá tagtha faoin nGaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht le roinnt blianta anuas, tá sé tábhachtach nach mbeidh an sainmhíniú úr ar an nGaeltacht teoranta do na ceantair sin amháin a bhfuil stádas reachtúil Gaeltachta acu faoi láthair. Chuige sin, tabharfar stádas reachtúil faoin mBille Gaeltachta do cheantair eile "Gaeltacht gréasáin" atá lasmuigh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta reachtúla atá ann faoi láthair. Is ceantair iad seo a mbeidh a bhformhór i bpobail uirbeacha agus a mbeidh toirt bhunúsach chriticiúil de thacaíocht phobail agus Stáit acu don Ghaeilge.

I am, however, currently in the process of meeting Arts officers collectively in the context of integrated Arts and Culture promotional strategies at local level.

The National Famine Commemoration ceremony will take place on Saturday, 10 September 2011 in Clones, County Monaghan.  The commemoration will comprise a programme in which the local communities in County Monaghan will be prominently involved followed by the formal State ceremonial event, which will include military honours and wreath laying ceremonies.I should say that my Department is currently engaging with all the relevant stakeholders to make the necessary arrangements for this year's commemoration. The great support in the local communities in Monaghan for this event is very welcome and is evidence of the deep respect still held today for all those who perished, suffered and emigrated during the famine.

The order was made on the grounds that No. 16 is a monument, the preservation of which is of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the Provisional Government.  The effect of the order is that works affecting these properties, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to them, will require my consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.The proposed development of the Carlton Cinema site, of which nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street form part, and for which approval has been granted by An Bord Pleanála, envisages the retention of these buildings and the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising in No. 16.  An application by the developer for consent to these proposals under section 14 of the 1930 Act was submitted to my Department on 17 June 2011. The consent application is being examined and a decision will be made as quickly as possible.Any wider plans for the development of the Moore Street area would be a matter for the relevant landowners and the development authority, Dublin City Council.

The network consists of 58 embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 11 consulates general and other offices overseas. In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis. The annual costs as set out in the table below for 2010 are the administrative costs of operating each mission. The figures do not include the salaries of the Irish based staff as these are a charge on the overall salaries budget of the Department rather than on a specific mission.In addition to the administrative costs of operating a mission, many embassies fund programmes in their respective countries, in particular the missions which fund Irish Aid activities.  For example, in 2010, while the embassy in Mozambique had administrative costs of almost €1 million, it managed an aid programme of €37.5 million through the mission that year. The administrative costs of offices in Irish Aid Programme countries (highlighted in bold) are often high due to issues such as the additional security required in a developing country context.Also, from time to time missions may incur significant capital expenditure in relation to their premises or for upgrading of essential infrastructure. These capital costs are not included in the annual administrative costs as detailed:Mission2010ABU DHABI  (opened 2009)600,261ABUJA556,374ADDIS ABABA898,685ANKARA422,633ATHENS525,292ATLANTA (opened 2010)26,885BEIJING841,615BERLIN930,500BERNE450,170BOSTON392,032BRASILIA579,964BRATISLAVA354,215BRUSSELS (EMBASSY and P.F.P.)930,301BRUSSELS (PR-EU)4,194,314BUCHAREST457,869BUDAPEST444,950BUENOS AIRES454,202CAIRO460,651CANBERRA788,271CARDIFF (closed 2009)—CHICAGO342,853COPENHAGEN448,180DAR ES SALAAM720,238DILI148,716EDINBURGH236,941FREETOWN199,440GENEVA1,142,564HANOI607,332HELSINKI539,507HOLY SEE455,820KAMPALA1,140,515KUALA LUMPUR409,445LILONGWE445,750LISBON376,459LJUBLJANA451,370LONDON3,702,234LUSAKA1,097,048LUXEMBOURG724,074MADRID1,106,768MAPUTO983,406MASERU512,812MEXICO528,437MOSCOW1,064,758NEW DELHI967,485NEW YORK — C.G.1,915,099NEW YORK- PMUN2,081,792NICOSIA419,656OSCE — VIENNA504,823OSLO601,640OTTAWA590,775PARIS (incl OECD)1,817,710PRAGUE612,292PRETORIA1,111,600RAMALLAH354,106RIGA360,659RIYADH381,231ROME1,180,581SAN FRANCISCO428,014SEOUL833,161SHANGHAI667,532SINGAPORE833,820SOFIA367,670STOCKHOLM591,585STRASBOURG424,895SYDNEY587,275TALLINN415,288TEHRAN417,048TEL AVIV623,858THE HAGUE921,078TOKYO1,637,651VALLETTA372,090VIENNA662,725VILNIUS425,124WARSAW842,848WASHINGTON DC1,329,159

In addition, 110 properties are rented by my Department outside the State for use primarily as offices and official residences.  Rental agreements vary from country to country in accordance with local law and practice. Leases are usually for a fixed period and many include rent review clauses. Rent increases on renewal of leases are generally in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the particular country. Rent levels abroad are reviewed each year. In addition, in the current economic climate, all our Missions are routinely instructed to explore the scope for negotiated reductions, having regard to local market conditions.

The convictions of these individuals were upheld on appeal in 2008. While I am aware of the ongoing campaign for the release of these individuals, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the United States and the Cuban authorities.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	552	Ireland's participation in EUTM Somalia is part of a larger effort to support, together with our EU partners, the creation of functioning, stable institutions in Somalia, without which there is little prospect of political progress in that country.  The EU is also supporting the transitional federal institutions in an effort to encourage dialogue within Somalia as a whole, and to enable an inclusive settlement.  The humanitarian problems which afflict Somalia are greatly magnified by the lack of government structures capable of meeting even the most basic needs of the Somali population.   Recognising the need for the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia (TFG) to gain control of its territory, the United Nations, in Security Council Resolutions 1872 (2009) and 1910 (2010) called on the international community to provide technical assistance towards the training and equipping of the Somalia national security forces.  The European Union established its training mission to Somalia (EUTM) in response to this call.  The original mandate of the mission was to train 2,000 selected Somali recruits in two intakes over a 12 month period.  This training, which was recently completed, took place in the Bihanga camp in Uganda.  The EU is now examining options to extend this mission, including refocusing the mission on developing command and control structures for the Somali national security forces.Following Government approval on 23 February 2010, a Defence Forces team of five personnel, comprising two officers and three non commissioned officers (NCOs), deployed to the mission in April 2010, as part of a joint Irish Defence Forces/Maltese armed forces training team.  On 28 June 2011, the Government approved the continued provision of approximately 5 members of the Permanent Defence Force to serve with the mission for a further period of one year beyond August 2011, subject to an appropriate decision of the Council of the European Union authorising the extension of the mission.I am satisfied that the provision of training to the Somali national security forces is supported by the United Nations and is specifically provided for in relevant Security Council Resolutions 1872 (2009) and 1910 (2010).  The role of the mission is consistent with the provisions of both UN resolutions.  The deployment of members of the Defence Forces in a training role to the EUTM Somalia is consistent with defence legislation.Ireland recognises that there can be no purely military solution to the crisis in Somalia.  We are strongly supportive of a comprehensive approach to tackling the problems of the region.  An important element will be to restore political stability in Somalia, but it will also be necessary to improve livelihoods and economic opportunities, and to develop the rule of law.  The EU is preparing a strategy to assist states in the Horn of Africa region to address these and other problems in a comprehensive way.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I have already expressed on a number of occasions my deep concern at reports of the use of force against Camp Ashraf residents in Iraq resulting in loss of life and serious injuries. The primary responsibility for the protection and human rights of all persons resident on its territory, including Camp Ashraf residents, rests with the government of Iraq. Ireland fully recognises Iraqi sovereignty over the whole of its territory, including Camp Ashraf, but this sovereignty also carries with it responsibilities. I therefore fully agree that the Iraqi authorities should either offer medical treatment to those seriously injured in Camp Ashraf or facilitate their treatment in another jurisdiction. I understand that the British government has not offered medical treatment to date and any such decision is a matter for that government.   I would like to reiterate that Ireland and the EU are determined to seek a long-term and peaceful solution to the predicament of the residents of Camp Ashraf. The EU Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation at Camp Ashraf on 23 May, emphasising the need to respect human rights. I fully support the view widely held within the Council that we must work with the UN (including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) and US in particular, to seek a lasting resolution to this situation.HR Ashton has clearly set out the EU position, including a strong condemnation of the recent violence in Camp Ashraf, and has conveyed this position in writing and by telephone to Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari. I particularly endorse HR Ashton's renewal of the EU's repeated call on the Iraqi government to refrain from the use of violence and to show full respect for the human rights of Camp Ashraf's residents. I also strongly support, and reiterate today, her call for a thorough and independent inquiry into the events of 8 April.Along with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to support clear messages to the Iraqi authorities that while there are no easy remedies to the situation in Camp Ashraf, force or other violations of human rights are not the answer. In actively seeking a solution, Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work with international institutions and partners, while calling upon the Iraqi government to protect the human rights of the residents of Camp Ashraf (including ensuring the provision of all necessary medical treatment), to grant access to independent international observers, to show restraint, and to seek a peaceful and sustainable solution.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.Decisions relating to the size and scale of the Irish diplomatic network area matter for consideration by the Government. The Vatican is not a significant economic entity and the promotion of foreign trade has never been a reason for maintaining our Embassy to the Holy See.  By comparison, our Embassy to the Italian Republic, also located in Rome, is highly active in the promotion and development of bilateral trade.  In 2010, Italy was Ireland's tenth largest merchandise trading partner with merchandise trade valued at €3.5bn.The main purpose of our Embassy to the Holy See is twofold.   First, to maintain a permanent point of contact with the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, which continues to be the stated religious denomination of a substantial majority of Irish citizens and whose actions and policies have a direct impact and influence on Irish society.Second, is to maintain ongoing relations with a significant global political entity which has diplomatic relations with 179 states.  The Holy See has one of the largest diplomatic corps in the world, making the Vatican an important listening post and crossroads on a range of global social, political and international issues of interest to Ireland, including human rights, development, disarmament and conflict resolution.The overall operating budget figures for the Embassy of the Holy See in 2010 was €455,820. This figure relates to local salary costs, travel, post and telecommunications, office machinery, office premises expenses and incidental expenses. In 2010, five staff were employed at the mission, comprising 3 locally employed staff and 2 diplomatic staff.  It should be noted the Vatican does not accept the accreditation of an ambassador who is also the ambassador to the Italian Republic.  Neither will it accept the accreditation of an embassy with the same address as the embassy to the Italian Republic.  Regardless, therefore, as to whether or not Ireland maintains a dedicated Embassy to the Holy See situated in Rome, appointing our Ambassador to the Italian Republic to be, at the same time, our Embassy to the Holy See, is not an option.The scale and presence of the Irish diplomatic network is currently being reviewed, along with all aspects of my Department's operations, as part of the Government's comprehensive review of expenditure.  Given the current budgetary situation, and recognising the role that our diplomatic network is playing in Ireland's economic recovery, adjustments to our diplomatic network will continue to be strategically focused.  In short, all our missions abroad must continue to deliver benefits for Ireland and must do so in a manner that represents good value for money.Consideration of proposals to reduce our diplomatic network must balance any potential financial savings against the operational and reputational costs that would be incurred, including undermining our ability to influence the policies of the state in question and writing off investments made over years in the bilateral relationships with the countries in question.  At a time when Ireland needs as much international support and cooperation as possible, it is important to get these decisions right.

Of this number, eight requests relate to general information in respect of obtaining travel documents, at a future date, for children not yet born.  Of the remaining families, seven have obtained an Irish travel document and,in four instances, families have obtained a travel document from another country.   As I indicated in my reply to question number 20180 of 13 July last, a range of Irish laws relating to the areas of citizenship, guardianship, consent for the child to travel and other parental rights must be comprehensively addressed by applicants before any travel document may issue.  It will not be possible to issue a passport (including an emergency passport) to a child born through surrogacy unless these questions of citizenship, guardianship and parental rights are comprehensively addressed.  They may therefore wish to make appropriate provision for the child, on such matters as accommodation and medical care/insurance etc., to remain in the country of birth until such time as a travel document can issue.    The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises Irish citizens arranging to have a child by surrogacy to engage the services of a lawyer to deal with all the complex issues involved.

Freedom of religious belief and expression is an issue which is discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral meetings and at European Union level.    At these meetings, the Government re-iterates the great importance Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law and urges the Chinese authorities to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights without further delay.Human rights issues are a constant and important point of dialogue between the European Union and the Chinese Government and are dealt with through the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue.  This broad-ranging dialogue has allowed the European Union to engage with China on issues such as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, prison conditions, freedom of religion and minority rights.  The last session of the dialogue took place on 16 June in Beijing at which concerns regarding the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners were again raised with the Chinese Government.For its part, Ireland will continue to actively raise human rights issues and individual cases of concern with the Chinese authorities.

The only semi-state body that operated under my Department during the period in question was the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO), which was established in 1973 and was integrated into my Department on 1 January 2004.The following bodies which operate, or operated, under the aegis of my Department, were established between 1997 and 2011:the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group — established 2010;the Development Education Advisory Committee — established 2003;the Audit Committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs — established 2003;The Hunger Task Force — established 2007 (ceased to exist after reporting in September 2008);the Advisory Board for Irish Aid (ABIA) — established 2002 (ceased to exist in October 2008).These bodies employ no staff and their administration is serviced directly from my Department. With the exception of the Hunger Task Force, members of which received a payment, all other members of committees serve in a voluntary capacity.The number of staff employed in 1997 was 981.  In January 2011, the number of staff was 1181.55. These figures exclude the number of locally-engaged staff, which is currently approximately 300.Increases in my Department's staffing complement over this 14-year period are largely attributable to the:recruitment of additional staff for the Passport Service to enable it to cope with annual increases in the demand for passports;expansion of the Irish Aid overseas development programme. The total budget administered by Irish Aid in 1997 was €114 million compared to €524 million in 2011.I should also inform the Deputy that my Department is obliged to shed a total of 177 posts over the period March 2009 to end December 2014 under the Government's current Employment Control Framework.

It is not possible to provide all the information requested in the timeframe provided. However, I would refer the Deputy to questions 22473/05 and 27606/08 which also address this issue. The following table sets out, for both Votes, the details of consultancy reports commissioned by my Department from 2007 to 2011 and the costs in each case. Given the volume of reports involved, it is not possible to give details on recommendations and their implementation. However, I would be happy to provide further information on any of the reports that are of particular interest to the Deputy.My Department commissions outside expertise where the specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and where the effective management and evaluation of programmes necessitates the presence of such skills. During the course of their engagements these consultants/experts may prepare reports and other documentation which are included in the following table.In addition to the information provided in tabular format, the Advisory Board for Irish Aid (ABIA) commissioned research programmes as part of its remit to undertake policy relevant international research. In 2008, a three year framework agreement was signed with the Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS) at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) to undertake three research projects around Policy Coherence for Development. The total cost of the three projects was € 301,889 and the Framework contract ran until 2010.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	563	While the purpose of approved pension arrangements is to provide for an income in retirement, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in some cases, the member's entitlements under an occupational pension scheme may be too small to justify the pension set up costs (e.g. purchase of an annuity). Revenue recognises the difficulty this can cause and will allow full commutation of the pension (that is, the payment of the pension in one sum) in certain circumstances. Firstly, full commutation of a pension is permitted by Revenue on what is referred to as "triviality" grounds where the aggregate benefits payable to an individual from the scheme in respect of the employment does not exceed the value of a pension of €330 per annum. The full amount of the pension commutation sum is subject to tax at a rate of 10%.Full commutation of a pension is also allowed by Revenue where, following the payment of any tax-free lump sum, the total of all remaining funds from all sources available for pension benefits is less than €20,000.  In a defined benefit scheme, the pension benefit is converted to a fund value using the scheme's commutation factor to determine if it is within the €20,000 limit.  This treatment is subject to the agreement of both the scheme beneficiary and the trustees and the resulting payment is treated like any other pension payment for the purposes of tax and is taxed under normal tax rules. The above option applies to all pension scheme members including holders of Buy Out Bonds, as an alternative to annuity purchase.In the case of Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs), as an alternative to purchasing an annuity, the holders of such pension plans can, under the Approved Retirement Fund regime, exercise an option to take the remainder of their pension fund (after taking the 25% lump sum) as taxable cash (or invest in an ARF), subject to conditions. The conditions are that the holder is over 75 years of age or, failing that, that they have a guaranteed level of pension income (€18,000 per annum at present) actually in payment for life at the time the decision to effect the cash (or ARF) option is exercised. Where the specified income test is not met, then an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) must be chosen into which a "set aside" amount must be invested from the pension fund (€119,800 at present) or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less than the "set aside" amount. However, in line with the full commutation option available to occupational pension scheme members and Buy out Bond holders referred to earlier, if all remaining funds available to the RAC/PRSA holder from all sources for pension benefits is less than €20,000 and it is not possible to establish an AMRF, the full commutation option may be used.These arrangements are allowed for under discretionary powers given to Revenue under section 772(4) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and are published in the Revenue Pensions Manual (Chapter 7). I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the €20,000 limit is reviewed from time to time and was last increased (from €15,000) in 2007.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.As the Deputy may be aware, agreement was reached at the European Council meeting on 24 June 2011 on the text of the European Stability Mechanism. On 11 July 2011, Euro Area Finance Ministers signed the Treaty at a eurogroup meeting subject to the completion of national parliamentary procedures.Under the proposed European Stability Mechanism Treaty, the ESM will have a total subscribed capital of €700 billion. Of this amount, €80 billion will be in the form of paid-in capital by the euro area member states, paid in five equal annual instalments from July 2013. The balance of €620 billion will be callable capital. The contribution key for each member state is based on the ECB capital contribution key. For Ireland the key is 1.5922% of the total paid and committed capital.Thus, Ireland's share of the €80 billion paid in capital will be just above €1.273 billion, to be paid in five equal instalments starting in July 2013. This will be paid from our annual budget. Ireland's share of the €620 billion callable capital will amount to €9.87164 billion.Euro area member states' commitment to the ESM will be in the form of paid in and callable capital. There are no guarantees involved in the ESM. The ESM Treaty does not include provision for opting-out of these commitments.The capital requirement for Ireland for the ESM will be provided for at the time it becomes operational and will be financed, as all expenditure is, through the various sources of funding that are available to the State. These include tax revenues, non-tax revenues, capital receipts and Exchequer borrowing, as necessary.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 97 together.As I said in a reply to a question from Deputy Flanagan on 21 June and Deputy McGuinness on 5 July, ensuring that a strategic investment bank is operating in the domestic banking market, providing finance to large capital projects and acting as a conduit for venture capital as well as a lender to SMEs, is an objective in the programme for Government.A comprehensive programme of bank recapitalisation and restructuring is currently underway following my statement on the future banking landscape in Ireland at the end of March last.  The essential detailed assessment and planning work to meet this objective will be accelerated once the Government's key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed. This assessment will include the bank's relationship with the two pillar banks and the timeline for its establishment.The Deputies may wish to reflect on the usefulness of repeated questions on this topic in such a short period of time and when the prerequisites for change have not been completed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I wish to point out that there is currently a greater parity between the VAT rates in Ireland and the UK than previously. The UK standard VAT rate at 20% is only 1 percentage point lower than the Irish standard VAT rate of 21%.  At 5% the UK reduced VAT rate is lower than our reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%.  However, Ireland applies reduced rates of VAT to a much wider range of goods and services than the UK.   VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services, and the rate applying is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The EU VAT Directive provides that member states operate a standard VAT rate of between 15% and 25% on the majority of goods and services.  Member states can also operate up to two reduced rates of between 5% and 15% on a select number of goods and services as listed in Annex III to that directive.  In addition, member states may retain historic VAT provisions that they had in place on 1 January 1991 with regard to applying a zero rate, or a rate of less than 5% (known as super-reduced rate), and also of applying a rate of between 12% and 15%, known as parked rates, on goods and services not listed in Annex III.Both Ireland and the UK avail of a range of such derogations from the standard VAT rate.   However, because of the historic nature of the parked and zero rates derogation, what goods or services they apply to are unique to each member state and could not be imitated by other jurisdictions.  For example, the UK historically applies a zero VAT rate to the supply of caravans, which could only apply at the standard rate in Ireland.  Similarly, there are many historic VAT derogations that Ireland applies that are not available to the UK or other member states.  In this respect, full bilateral VAT harmonisation between Ireland and the UK would only be possible where both jurisdictions remove these derogrations and apply a unified standard VAT rate to those goods and services that they currently apply at the zero-rate or at a reduced rate.In addition, as stated earlier, Ireland applies reduced rates to a much wider ranger of goods and services than the UK, many of which relate to Annex III services which are open to all member states to charge at a reduced rate.  In this case it would be possible for the UK to apply a reduced rate to all the Annex III reduced rated goods and service in Ireland.As is clear, not only is the overall VAT system complex but the system of VAT rates that apply to the supply of goods and services is equally complex.  In this context the harmonisation of VAT between Ireland and the UK would require very substantial reform of VAT rates in both jurisdictions.  Given the economic nature of making changes to the VAT rate on any single good or service, it is clear that in the short term VAT harmonisation between Ireland and the UK is unfeasible.  In addition, as it is not possible for member states to charge VAT on a regional basis, any changes to VAT rates for the sake of cross-border harmonisation would have to apply on a UK wide basis.Nevertheless, greater VAT harmonisation on an EU basis is one of the longer term goals of the EU.  On 1 December 2010, the EU Commission published a Green Paper on the Future of VAT marking the launch of a public consultation on the future of the VAT system and essentially the delivery of a simpler and more efficient system tailored to support/promote activity in the single market.  Among other issues, the Green Paper deals with the continued relevance of reduced VAT rates and existing derogations for member states.  The paper also deals with the degree of harmonisation needed for the single market, the reduction of red-tape for business, enhanced fraud-proofing of the system, and modernising the administration of the VAT system by tax authorities.

These are contributions to retirement annuity contracts (RACs) and personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs) by self-employed individuals and employees in non-pensionable employment and also contributions by employees and employers via payrolls to occupational pension schemes and PRSAs.  Contributions by companies on behalf of their employees are  included in the figures provided by employers and these figures are derived from the annual P35 returns made by employers to the Revenue Commissioners. The total aggregated amounts of all contributions   for the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the latest year available, are as follows:Amounts Claimed€ million20053,131.520064,05220074,257.520084,470A breakdown of the main constituents of these aggregates is  shown in the following tables:Year€ million20051,031.520061,27020071,24420081,145The information on RACs and PRSAs  is based on income tax returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing approximately between 85% and 95% of all returns expected, depending on when the data was extracted for each year. As is done for the purpose of compiling annual estimates of cost to the Exchequer, these basic figures are, in accordance with normal practice, grossed-up at aggregate level to adjust for the perceived level of incompleteness.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers the amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against all rental income assessable under Case V, Schedule D is as set out in the following table:Tax yearInterest Relief (Rental) €mRate2007877100%20081,150100%200973075%These estimates are based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figures provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.The figures for 2009 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11. This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of €115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year. The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.   A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans — retirement annuity contracts (RACs) and personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs) — by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures. However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of €115,000 to €100,000 and confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about €500 million.The latest full historical data available in this regard is in respect of the tax year 2008.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	576	While there is no particular pension saving scheme or plan specifically designated for use by proprietary directors, many such individuals save for their retirement through what are called small self-administered pension schemes (SSAS). SSAS are typically single member pension schemes with the scheme member normally also being the owner/proprietary director of a business and the trustee of the scheme. The Revenue Commissioners have special rules in relation to the approval, operation and supervision of these schemes. Among other requirements, SSAS are required to submit annual accounts to Revenue which detail the pension contributions made to the scheme, the investment income and gains accrued and the end-year fund value.
I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the scheme accounts data  returned in respect of SSAS in the past are not capable of being electronically captured in a way that would make it possible to provide the information requested  by the Deputy for the years in question. The resources necessary to obtain the data manually would be significant and would require the diversion of such resources from other important areas of work such as audit.  I am further advised by the Commissioners that section 16 of Finance Act 2010 included an amendment to the administrative requirements on SSAS which oblige the administrators of such schemes to deliver annual scheme accounts for the years ending on or after 1 January 2011 by such electronic means as are required or approved by the Revenue Commissioners. This amendment will allow for more cost-effective and timely collection of data on SSAS in future years and Revenue are progressing the necessary administrative and technical changes required to facilitate electronic delivery at an early date. There is no requirement on occupational pension schemes, generally, (other than SSASs) or personal pension plan providers or owners to provide Revenue with details of the individual or employer contributions made to these pension funds for each individual scheme member or plan beneficiary. To the extent, therefore, that proprietary directors use pension saving arrangements other than or in addition to SSAS, it is not possible to separately isolate or identify those arrangements.

The agency also advises that a small number of the loans transferred would have the features outlined by the Deputy, namely1) where the amount outstanding was relatively small in relation to the value of the underlying property; or2) where the repayment record on the loan had been excellent up to the point of acquisition by NAMA; or3) where there is a reasonable expectation that the loan will be repaid in full; or4) where there is a reasonable expectation that the loan can be cleared in the short term (and indeed there have been such loans).However, NAMA also informs me that the discounts were primarily based on the underlying value of the property which was the security for the loan and that the performance status of the loan was not a major factor in the valuation methodology which was approved by the European Commission. The rationale for this was that, in the case of a loan portfolio which was largely distressed, the value of the underlying collateral was the best estimate for the ultimate realisable value of the loan.

On that basis Revenue is not assured as to the basic financial viability of the business and so has a petition before the High Court in the next week for the appointment of a liquidator. I am advised by Revenue that given its concerns and the fact that the debt is actually increasing, a revised repayment schedule would not be appropriate and it will be proceeding with its liquidation petition to the Court.

The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the regulation of credit unions and is independent in the exercise of his duties.  I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.  I have consulted with the Registrar who advises as follows: From time to time, the Registrar of Credit Unions issues guidance to ensure compliance by credit unions with their legal and regulatory obligations.   The "Guidance Note on Investments by Credit Unions" issued in October 2006 stated that investments by credit unions in a single institution should not exceed 25 percent of the total value of a credit union's investment portfolio.  This guidance note was developed after extensive consultation with stakeholders in the sector including the credit union representative bodies.  Further circular letters of clarification were issued to credit unions as required from time to time.  Guidance notes issued by the Registrar of Credit Unions are available at http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/credit-unions/Pages/guidance.aspx
The Registrar wrote to credit unions on the 20 June 2011 informing them that, as the structural changes now taking place in the Irish banking sector may result in credit unions exceeding the limit set out in the Guidance Note as institutions merge or as deposits are transferred under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, credit unions will be allowed a period of 24 months in which to bring their investment portfolio back into compliance with the single institution exposure limit contained in the Guidance Note.  The Registrar also noted that this is a transitional arrangement to facilitate credit unions managing the diversification of their investment portfolios over a reasonable period of time in a planned manner and that while it is in place current exposure levels above the 25 percent limit may not be increased.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	583	The report referred to is an econometric analysis, carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, on the market for cigarettes in Ireland.  It suggests, based on this analysis, that Ireland has moved beyond the optimum point regarding the effectiveness of taxation to reduce cigarette consumption.  The research suggests that higher cigarette taxes in Ireland would no longer produce a win-win situation of public health benefits (lower rates of smoking) and benefits to the public finances (higher levels of tax revenue).  More likely, it appears that in the Irish market for cigarettes as it currently stands, a tax increase could reduce revenue but only have a lesser impact on tobacco consumption by encouraging further substitution away from taxed cigarettes.  The findings of the report which, given our already high levels of excise on cigarettes, at least questions the usefulness of further increases in excise rates as a means of reducing overall cigarette consumption will be considered, along with other relevant factors and issues, when the taxation of cigarettes is being examined in the context of the annual budget.

This radical restructuring of the banking system is designed to put our banking system on a firm footing which is essential to Ireland's economic recovery.The recent positive review delivered by the Troika as well as the EBA stress test results for the two pillar banks reinforces that decision and puts us on the path to re-start stability and economic growth in core businesses based on a sound and well capitalised banking system with two pillar institutions.While there are, at present, a number of foreign owned entities that operate within the Irish banking market and I would welcome further interest that foreign entities may have in entering the Irish market.

The Programme for Government states that further reductions in the deficit will be required thereafter.  However, the current budgetary projections contained in the Stability Programme Update, published in April, are only available out to 2015.  Based on these projections, the Budget will not be in balance by 2015 but importantly will no longer be in excessive deficit.  It is also important to note that a primary surplus — that is an excess of revenues over expenditure excluding debt interest — of 1.7% of GDP is forecast to emerge in 2014.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 96 together.The Deputies will be aware that the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period.  In each bank, a team of senior managers will be dedicated to the task of ensuring lending continues to grow to support economic growth.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.Both pillar banks provide my Department with monthly figures on balance sheet volumes, sanctioned facilities and geographic and industrial breakdowns of their SME lending.  The Deputies may also be aware that under the terms of the government recapitalisation, both banks also produce a quarterly report which incorporates figures for sanctions and drawdowns by SMEs.  The data contained in these reports will continue to be reviewed and analysed by my Department and the Credit Review Office to ensure that the banks are compliant with the terms of the Government recapitalisation as it relates to the provision of credit for SMEs.I expect the pillar banks which have received considerable Government support to develop and offer a range of products to support SMEs and to ensure that lending targets are met.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	587	As the Deputy will be aware, deposits in Irish banks were on a downward trajectory during 2009 and 2010 as fears grew about the health of their balance sheets and rating agencies downgraded their recommendations.  The Government's first priority was therefore to ensure that they were adequately capitalised to not only restore depositor and investor confidence, but to ensure they were in a position to support the economy going forward in terms of new lending.  The Central Bank completed an in depth analysis of the banks' balance sheets in Q1 of this year using external consultants and the €24 billion capital need identified as a result of this exercise is currently being provided for.  The exercise has generally been judged a success by the market a result which was highlighted again last week when the EBA stress tests results were released.As I understand it, the result of this further recapitalisation of the banks is that if depositors on the ground now have any concerns it tends to resolve around uncertainties at a European level rather than the health of the Irish banking system.Of course recapitalisation of our banks takes place against a general restructuring effort which will shrink not only the number of players in the market but the size and shape of these institutions and this will also bear fruit in terms of providing a road map to stability.At a broader level the government remains focused on stabilising and growing the domestic economy such that rising incomes will be reflected in increased deposits in the Irish banking system.As regards the suggestion of a zero rate of DIRT for one year, if this proposal was introduced that yield would be lost to the Exchequer and the money would have to be found elsewhere, whether through increased taxation from other sources or reduced expenditure.  To indicate the amount that may be involved, the 2010 yield from DIRT was €445 million.  I do not feel charging DIRT on deposit interest is a significant deterrent to saving, especially since DIRT is a final liability tax (that is, no further income tax is due on interest subject to DIRT) and income subject to DIRT is not liable to the Universal Social Charge.  Even if reducing the DIRT rate encouraged savings in Irish Banks, making the reduction for one year would not encourage the maintenance of deposits there.  Also, under European law we would be required to charge the same rate of tax on deposit interest in banks throughout the EU.I have no plans at this time to make the suggested change.  However, any taxation changes will be determined in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill.

(The Deputy may be aware that residential Stamp Duty rates were reduced in December 2010 to 1% on consideration up to €1 million and 2% on the balance over 1 million.)  The Stamp Duty Land Tax rate in the UK is not a straightforward 1% across the board.  The charge can be up to 4% and the rate charged depends on a number of factors, including whether a property is freehold or leasehold, and whether the property is residential, non-residential or mixed-use.  Also, the purchase of a new lease with a substantial annual rent may attract an additional Stamp Duty Land Tax charge.  It is, therefore, a more complex tax than our Stamp Duty on transfers of non-residential property, where the primary factor that determines the rate is the consideration for the property.Any potential taxation changes will be determined in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill and following the comprehensive spending review.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 102 and 104 together.I am aware that certain commentators and reports are suggesting that the Irish property market could experience further declines.  However, I would remind the Deputy that the PCAR bank stress tests carried out by the Central Bank are among the most thorough and demanding such tests ever performed in Ireland and or indeed anywhere in the world.  For transparency purposes the Central Bank has disclosed the full details of the base and stress scenario assumptions in its report.  The potential impact on commercial rents by new legislation was not specifically modelled but the loss forecast involved taking a conservative view on rents actually being received  and therefore the values derived from those rents was conservative.In addition to the conservative economic assumptions built into the capital scenarios the Central Bank has gone further than its international peers — including the recent EBA stress test results — in setting its requirements by taking a three year, rather than two year outlook and also by requiring capital levels after any stress losses of 6%, rather than 5% of Risk Weighted Assets.  The need to convince the market as to the strength of our banks has been the significant driver of these higher capital targets.  They are founded on robust models, highly conservative assumptions and also include additional conservative buffer layers for any additional unknown factors.The Government is fully supportive of the work carried out by the Central Bank and its independent advisors in establishing a capital base for our banks that will be one of the most stringent in the world.  I see no reason therefore to question the adequacy of the stress tests, and there is no basis for deferring the recapitalisation of the institutions in question.With regard to upward only rent reviews, the Minister for Justice and Equality recently informed the House that following an initial consultation process with the Attorney General, he had forwarded outline proposals to her for further examination and development.  Those proposals have been the subject of preliminary discussion by Government, and will be considered further in the autumn when the work in relation to them should be at a more advanced stage.

It is expected that the effect of these actions will be to reduce the amount of capital required by the State very significantly.  In particular, a number of the financial institutions have recently engaged in liability management exercises in relation to subordinated debt.  The results of the liability management exercises at the AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life & Permanent will be announced in full to the markets on their conclusion but have already resulted in the generation of some €4.4bn in Core Tier 1 Capital, reducing accordingly the amount required to be contributed by the State to the €24bn PCAR capital requirement.Only after the burden sharing measures have been completed, all sources of private capital have been exhausted and shareholders in the three institutions have been given the opportunity to vote, will the level of further capital required to be contributed by the State in order to complete the recapitalisation measures be finalised to the level of detail being requested by the Deputies.  However, the State has committed to completing the recapitalisations as agreed under the Programme of Financial Support for Ireland to the extent possible by 31 July.  State funding for the recapitalisation will come from funds currently held on deposit in the banks by the Exchequer and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	598	As I have said previously in my Statement on Banking in March, the PCAR bank stress tests carried out by the Central Bank are certainly among the most thorough and demanding such tests ever performed in Ireland and or indeed anywhere.  The detailed results methodology and assumptions underlying these stress tests have been published, emphasising Ireland's firm commitment for this critical exercise to be fully open and transparent.  In addition to the very conservative economic assumptions built into the capital scenarios the Central Bank has gone further than its international peers in setting its requirements by taking a three year rather than two year outlook and also by requiring capital levels after any stress losses of 6% rather than 5% of Risk Weighted Assets.The bank stress testing exercise, the results of which were announced by the Central Bank of Ireland on 31 March 2011, included a detailed review of loan files on an appropriate sampling basis.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Financial Measures Programme also announced on that date included an independent loan loss assessment exercise performed by BlackRock Solutions ("BlackRock"), the results of which informed the calculation of capital requirements for Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Life and Permanent under the PCAR.BlackRock performed a comprehensive review of the loan portfolios of the PCAR banks, with the assistance of a number of accountancy firms, legal firms and credit experts.  The Central Bank also appointed the Boston Consulting Group, an international consultancy firm, to provide oversight and challenge to BlackRock's work and to ensure consistency across institutions and portfolios.  To perform the loan loss assessment, loss models were custom-built for the banks' portfolios as of 31 December 2010.  A data integrity and verification exercise was performed to ensure robust outputs from the loan loss assessment models.  The accountancy firms, hired by BlackRock, carried out four specific activities including a loan file sampling and testing.BlackRock and its subcontractors conducted in-depth assessments of loan portfolios by reviewing loan files and, in some cases, work-out capacity.  By examining and reviewing loan files, a more accurate assessment of the value of the underlying collateral was possible, enabling a refinement of loan loss assessment assumptions.  The loan file reviews focused on large loans and impaired assets.  The number of files sampled varied across portfolios and banks but was sufficiently large to allow BlackRock to elicit qualitative and quantitative findings that were subsequently incorporated into their loan loss assessments.In specific terms I am satisfied on the basis of the results of the PCAR assessment carried out by the Central Bank, which have been endorsed by the external authorities, that the loan loss assumptions made reflects a high degree of conservatism and underpin the robustness and credibility of the exercise overall.I am strengthened in this view by the results of the European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests on Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent which were published on 15 July.  The results of the tests show that the Irish banks meet the stress requirements and do not require additional capital beyond the requirement set in the Financial Measures Programme published in March 2011.  The results of the EBA stress tests take account of the recapitalisation measures announced following the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR), which required the banks to raise an additional €24 billion to in order to achieve a core tier 1 ratio of 6% at the end of 2013 in a stressed scenario.It should be noted that stress testing is used by banking supervisors to determine whether a bank is adequately capitalised to withstand adverse macro-economic events or unanticipated shocks.  Our banks will be well capitalised by international standards following the recapitalisation measures but this position will not then remain frozen in time.  Apart from anything else, both the global and domestic economies will continue to evolve and the Central Bank will perform future annual PCAR assessments to ascertain the position of the banks at that point in time.  That does not necessarily mean that the banks will require any further capital.  However; no eventuality, regardless of how remote, can be ruled out when predicting future events.  I would nevertheless reiterate that based on the conservative assessments used in the PCAR/PLAR analysis of potential future scenarios for the banks, and indeed the Irish economy, I am entirely satisfied that the banks are currently well capitalised to serve the needs of the Irish economy following this round of measures.

The Taoiseach is attending this meeting.  The meeting is expected to discuss further enhancement of the EFSF, including the issue of reducing the cost of the funding for all programme countries.  The Taoiseach will take the opportunity to support any proposal for a reduction in EFSF pricing, as it is the Government’s strong position that the margin being charged on loans for all  programme countries from both the EFSM and the EFSF is excessive.  The outcome of today’s discussion will inform our approach on the pricing of all EU financial support, including our own programme.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	600	I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 134 together.The Amendment to the EFSF Framework Agreement was signed by Euro Area Finance Ministers on July 13th 2011, subject to the completion of the necessary national parliamentary procedures of each Euro Area Member State.  This amended Agreement was the outcome of months of negotiation and Member States have been requested to ratify the amended Agreement by the end of 2011 at the latest.The main changes to the EFSF Framework agreement are to raise the maximum guarantee commitments to €780 billion, increase the effective lending capacity of the EFSF to €440 billion and broaden the scope of the EFSF whereby the EFSF may, on exceptional basis intervene in the primary debt market.  Other changes include changes to the margin, pricing structure and the new advance margin, all of which are aim to improve the functioning of the EFSF and to facilitate reductions to the cost of borrowing from the EFSF.On the 11th July, Euro Area Ministers discussed the deepening threat of contagion within the Euro Area and reaffirmed their absolute commitment to safeguard financial stability in the Euro Area.  The statement issued by Eurogroup after the meeting noted that "To this end, Ministers stand ready to adopt further measures that will improve the euro area's systemic capacity to resist contagion risk, including enhancing the flexibility and the scope of the EFSF, lengthening the maturities of the loans and lowering the interest rates, including through a collateral arrangement where appropriate.  Proposals to this effect will be presented to Ministers shortly".The interest rate applying to the funds Ireland borrows from the EFSF remains of concern to Ireland.  The Government will continue to seek a reduction in our interest rate margin and to avail of any further enhanced flexibility to the EFSF that will lower the cost of borrowing to Ireland and facilitate Ireland's return to the market at the earliest opportunity.In relation to the additional flexibility proposed for the EFSF, last week's statement noted that proposals are to be presented to Ministers.  There proposals are being considered at today's meeting of Euro Area Heads of State and Government.  Decisions on how to avail of any additional flexibility within the EFSF must await final agreement and implementation of such measures.

The EU-IMF Programme commitment on state assets relates to the fourth quarter of this year, and includes a provision that Government will discuss its plans with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  Progress on this commitment was considered during the recent review, and the Government's commitments on asset disposals in the Programme for Government formed part of that discussion.  It is expected that there will be further discussion with the Troika on asset disposals, including a further update at the next quarterly review, before decisions on asset disposals are finalised.

The Government is fully aware of the importance of that target in the context of the 2012 Budget.  The Government is committed to implementing an overall adjustment package of at least €3.6 billion in 2012.  This is to ensure the deficit target for 2012 can be achieved.  As we go through the second half of the year, we will have to study closely the emerging trends, both positive and negative, and formulate what the likely outlook for 2012 will be.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	604	In Budget 2011, the Department of Finance forecast nominal GDP to be €161,200 million and for nominal GNP to be €127,900 million in 2011 (figures rounded to nearest €100m).  These forecasts also underpinned the National Recovery Plan that was finalised in October 2010.  The Department's latest forecasts were published in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) of April 2011 and thus had the benefit of six months more economic data.These data pointed, in the main, to weaker than expected domestic activity that would not be compensated for by somewhat stronger external demand.  While the possibility of such an outturn was identified in Budget 2011, the fact that these risks had started to materialise meant that they were taken into account in the SPU.  As such the forecasts for GDP and GNP for this year were revised down in April's SPU to €156,075 million and €125,925 respectively (rounded to the nearest €25m).Revised forecasts will be published in the pre-Budget Outlook in the autumn.

Work will continue over the coming weeks and months in the lead up to the 2012 Budget in assessing all of the emerging economic and budgetary data and the implications they might have for 2012 and beyond.  I will be kept fully informed of developments by my Department.  Work on the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) is also ongoing.  The CRE will be a critical building block in formulating Government's budgetary policy for 2012 and beyond.  The results of the Comprehensive Review process will be brought before Government for consideration and decision in the Budget and Estimates process later this year.As Minister for Finance, I will be working very closely with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform over the coming weeks and months in the preparation of Budget 2012 as the expenditure estimates are obviously a key factor in devising budgetary policy. In that regard, and as is usual every year, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be in contact with all line Departments.  In addition, my Department is in routine contact with the Revenue Commissioners on a variety of matters which have a budgetary dimension, including those relating to tax policy and implementation and receipts from taxation.  The Tax Strategy Group — an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Finance, with membership comprising senior officials and advisors from other key Departments and the Revenue Commissioners — will also be meeting over the coming months in the lead up to Budget 2012.My Department will publish a pre-Budget Outlook in October and it is intended that Budget 2012 will be presented to Dáil Éireann in early December, although the exact date has yet to be decided.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	606	The Jobs Initiative is designed to be funded on a budgetary neutral basis over the 2011 — 2014 period.  The introduction of a reduced 9% VAT rate is expected to cost €120 million this year and the PRSI measures enacted as part of the Jobs Initiative are expected to cost €95 million in 2011.  It should be noted that PRSI receipts are not received directly by the Exchequer as part of tax revenues, but are instead used to fund social welfare-related expenditure.  The abolition of the Air Travel Tax is expected to cost €15 million this year.  Total additional current expenditure to specified areas in 2011 arising from the Jobs Initiative will amount to €29 million, €18 million of which will be funded by the reallocation of existing resources and €11 million from the introduction of the levy on pension funds.  Total additional capital expenditure to specified areas arising from the Jobs Initiative will amount to €135 million in 2011 which will be funded by the reallocation of €106 million from within existing resources and €29 million from the pension levy.  The temporary Pension Levy being introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative is projected to yield €470 million this year.  Therefore, in overall terms, there is a small net gain to the Exchequer in 2011 from the measures introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative.  Over the 2011 — 2014 period as a whole, the Jobs Initiative will be budgetary neutral.  The Department of Finance has not revised it aggregate tax forecast for this year.  However, it will continue to closely monitor the performance of tax receipts during the remainder of the year.

For the information of the Deputy, of the above ten, four will be in office at Bank of Ireland, a further four at EBS Ltd — which will operate as a standalone, separately branded subsidiary of AIB with its own branch network — and the remaining two at Irish Life and Permanent.  Six of these individuals hold executive positions with the remaining four occupying non-executive roles.  Of the remaining institutions no pre-crisis directors are still in post.The Deputy will be aware that as part of the Programme for Government we committed to restructuring bank boards and to replacing all directors who presided over the failed lending practices in the period to September 2008.  He will also be aware that board and management renewal plans for the affected institutions are under consideration and that, as announced by the Central Bank of Ireland, all directors irrespective of date of appointment, who intend to be in office on 1 January 2012 will be subject to assessment against the new fitness and probity standards for such appointments which the CBI envisages being implemented by 1 September 2011.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The Finance Act 2011 contains legislation that, subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order, provides for the extension of betting duty to remote bookmakers and betting exchanges. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will provide for a regulatory and licensing regime, is enacted. The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2011 is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.  It is expected that by including this high-growth area of the betting sector, particularly given the increasing prevalence of smart phones, the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.  In a full year it is expected that the tax yield could grow up to €20 million depending on the prevailing market conditions.Just as important is the positive signal this measure will convey to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland.  A location with an appropriate licensing framework coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on information regarding the cost of these schemes, which has been received and collated for the tax year 2009, the latest year for which data is available, the estimated annual cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax forgone is €0.2 million.All other such property-based schemes have been terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for certain schemes where projects were already in the pipeline.  However, due to their nature these "legacy" reliefs continue to impose ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.I have initiated an economic impact assessment in relation to all the "legacy" property-based tax reliefs, and a public consultation is currently underway as the first stage in that process.  The results of this assessment will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget.

Those subject to the full restriction, at adjusted incomes of €400,000 or greater, pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and Universal Social Charge.  The list of specified reliefs that are subject to the restriction are set out in Schedule 25B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Broadly, the reliefs restricted are the various property based tax incentives and certain other reliefs such as the Business Expansion Scheme, film relief and donations relief. Also restricted are certain tax exemptions including artistic income and patent royalties. The normal deductible items available to the broad range of taxpayers such as medical expenses, trade union subscriptions, the personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit are not restricted. Similarly, normal business expenses and deductions for capital allowances on plant and machinery, as well as genuine business related trading losses are not restricted.When the amended restriction was announced in Budget 2010, it was estimated that the changes would yield approximately €55 million in addition to the existing yield of €40 million.It is worth pointing out that taxpayers who only claim personal tax credits, pay an effective rate of income tax of around 30% where their annual incomes exceed €125,000 approximately.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	623	In the Programme for Government we have committed to reducing, capping or abolishing property tax reliefs and other tax shelters which benefit very high income earners.  I would point out to the Deputy that the existing restriction of reliefs or horizontal measure is activated where individuals have an adjusted income of €125,000 and claim specified reliefs of €80,000 or more.  Those subject to the full restriction, at adjusted incomes of €400,000 or greater, are required to pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and levies.The list of specified reliefs that are subject to the restriction are set out in Schedule 25B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Broadly, the reliefs restricted are the various property-based tax incentives and certain other reliefs such as the Business Expansion Scheme, film relief and donations relief.  Also restricted are certain tax exemptions including artistic income and patent royalties.  The normal deductible items available to the broad range of taxpayers such as medical expenses, trade union subscriptions, the personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit are not restricted. Similarly, normal business expenses and deductions for capital allowances on plant and machinery, as well as genuine business related trading losses are not restricted.Specifically in relation to property tax reliefs, an assessment process has been commenced to consider the possible impacts of reducing, capping or abolishing the "legacy" property-based tax reliefs.  The impact assessment will consider the economic impact of curtailing the costs to the State of outstanding or ‘legacy' reliefs, which have so far not been fully claimed by investors.Our objective in conducting the assessment, which includes a public consultation, is to gain a better understanding of the benefits that may accrue to the Exchequer in terms of additional tax yield as well as consequences for investor groups and the wider economy arising from possible changes to the treatment of these reliefs.  The results of this assessment will inform the budgetary process.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	624	The Deputy may wish to know that there is already a comprehensive regulatory licensing system in place for moneylenders. Moneylenders have to apply to the Central Bank annually to have their licenses renewed. Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 (as amended) sets out the Central Bank's powers in relation to the grant or refusal of a moneylender's license. The appropriate moneylending application form (new or renewal) must be completed and returned to the Central Bank with a number of items, for review and consideration.  In addition to the licensing system, the Central Bank has in place a Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders (the Code). The Central Bank has power to impose sanctions on moneylenders for a contravention of the Code. The Code sets out the General Principles with which a moneylender must comply. For example, a moneylender must act honestly and professionally, with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of consumers.  The Code also places requirements on moneylenders in relation to the provision of information to the consumer, preservation of a consumer's rights, knowing the consumer, suitability, unsolicited contact (cold calling), disclosure, errors, handling complaints, consumer records, unsolicited credit facilities, arrears and guarantees, debt collection and the contents and presentation of advertisements.On 18 February 2011, the Central Bank published the results of a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders. The inspection showed a high level of compliance amongst firms, with the requirements of the Code. Inspections were conducted in 11 of the 46 licensed moneylenders currently operating in Ireland. The inspections focused on whether consumers were being charged in accordance with the moneylenders' authorised APRs (Annual Percentage Rates) and costs of credit as set out in the moneylenders' licenses. It also examined whether firms had their licenses on display and if they indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers, as required by the Code. Overall the inspections found a high level of compliance with the requirements and that consumers were being charged in accordance with the moneylenders' authorised APRs and costs of credit. In addition, firms had their licenses on display and indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers.I would expect that, in future, the Annual Regulatory Performance Statement of the Central Bank will refer to the regulation of moneylenders. This statement will be presented to each House of the Oireachtas.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 provides that a Committee of the Oireachtas may request the Governor of the Central Bank or the Head of Financial Regulation to attend before it and provide information relating to the regulatory performance statement.  This will allow deputies the opportunity to seek relevant information on regulatory matters, including the regulation of moneylenders.The regulation of debt collectors is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.

Detailed information on the sovereign exposure of the four institutions was published by the Central Bank in the Financial Measures Programme Report on 31 March 2011.  The Central Bank also published the results of the European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests on Allied Irish Bank (AIB), Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent (IL&P) on 15 July 2011 and they are available on the Bank's website. I am informed by the Central Bank that those results which, like the data given in my reply of 2 June 2011 in relation to the PCAR exercise, are based on the situation at 31 December 2010, include data for the debt holdings of the Irish banks but figures for holdings of Irish government bonds are not shown separately.

This represented the beginning of a protracted process that will involve a detailed examination of the Proposal, line by line, by all Member States at Council.  Since the Commission's proposal has been published, Department of Finance officials, along with officials from the Revenue Commissioners have been attending the Working Party on Tax Questions which is the forum for discussions on the proposal.  To date, my officials have attended meetings on a monthly basis in relation to the proposal.Both I and the Government have made it clear that Ireland, like all other Member States, intend to actively engage in that process because only in that way can we absolutely ensure that all of the arguments are brought to the table.I want to assure the Deputy that it is clearly understood that our engagement is strictly on the basis that taxation is a matter of national competence and that the principle of unanimity in taxation is fully respected.

This is important from the point of view of ensuring that their operations are managed, by their respective boards and management on a commercial basis in the best interests of, in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, the State.  I am advised by the bank that the remuneration package applicable to the Group Chief Executive  post consists of a base salary with additional benefits including monthly contribution to a defined contribution pension scheme, a car allowance, a temporary rent allowance, agreed travel expenses, agreed relocation related expenses and club subscriptions.In relation to the issue of the base salary applying to the position in the Deputy's question, the prevailing Government policy revolves around the recommendations of the Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee (CIROC) set up by my predecessor. The base salary applicable to the post of Group Chief Executive of the bank is set at €500,000 in line with the CIROC recommendation as amended by Government in March 2009.The bank further informs me that it does not operate a performance related bonus scheme for executives hence no annual performance bonus has been paid or awarded to the Group Chief Executive during the year ended 31 December 2010.Further information in relation to the remuneration of the Group Chief Executive is published in Note 54 to the bank's Annual Report and Accounts 2010.The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the remuneration review underway at the covered institutions, the institutions have been asked to consider measures that could be taken to realign staff expectations with regard to remuneration and benefits in the current economic environment and financial circumstances of the banks.

Accordingly, I do not compile the data sought by the Deputy at the level of detail he is seeking.  This also applies to a whole series of questions put down for answer on the issue of remuneration matters at the covered institutions lately.As I have said in response to these questions, my Department cannot compile data on a bespoke basis in relation to a large number of differently framed remuneration related questions at once, in the timeframe applicable to parliamentary replies and within the resources available, so I am seeking to find an approach that can properly respond to the clear public interest here.As I have indicated in other replies yesterday on the same subject, far from wanting to restrict access to such information, I fully recognise that there is a real public interest in the levels of remuneration at the covered institutions.  I have asked the institutions to compile data on remuneration practices and details with a view, as part of the remuneration review presently being conducted by the institutions at the request of my Department, to improving transparency on the issue.  I will endeavour to have this completed in light of the above comments in the shortest timeframe possible with a view to putting the information into the public domain.

The performance of the NPRF since its establishment has been professional. In recent times it has suffered poor returns in exceptionally volatile conditions. This has been the experience generally of comparable investment institutions.2. Where the national interest is concerned, it is appropriate that the Minister for Finance should be in a position to give directions on investment policy to the NPRF Commission, notwithstanding the requirement on the NPRF to secure the optimal financial return. This will require enabling legislation.3. A top financial priority at this time is to contain the State's borrowing requirement which has exceeded earlier expectations by a wide margin. In this climate there is a case for suspending or adjusting payments to the Fund, especially as the cost of borrowing may well be higher than the Fund is likely to earn on its investments in the short term.4. Any decision should also take account of the need to preserve the Fund, to the maximum extent possible, and the potential reactions from prospective international investors and credit rating agencies.5. The options in relation to contributions to the Fund are to continue with existing arrangements or to adjust downwards or suspend payment in full on a temporary basis (preferably for the calendar year 2009 only).  Valid arguments can be put forward in support of each option and the issues are finely balanced.6. In view of the conflicting priorities and uncertainties that lie ahead, the more prudent approach at this time is to take a longer term perspective and maintain a contribution to the Fund, even at a lower level than is now required.  Any change in existing arrangements will require enabling legislation.7. The scope for non-cash payments, such as shareholdings, in making contributions to the Fund, should be explored further. In this context, it is for consideration also whether the legal prohibition on the Fund taking control or large stakes in individual companies should be amended.8. The NPRF Commission should redouble their efforts at this time to find suitable investment opportunities in Ireland given the new economic realities.Implementation of recommendations:Not directly resulting from Mr O'Connell's report, under legislation enacted in 2009 and 2010, the Minister for Finance has power to direct the NPRF Commission to —invest in credit institutions (used to recapitalise AIB and BoI)buy Irish Government bondsprovide cash to the Exchequer for capital expenditure until 2013ensure that it has cash or liquid assets available in the event of a direction.In addition, the Minister for Finance has power, until 2013, to suspend or reduce the statutory annual Exchequer contribution of 1% of GNP to the Fund.In relation to the investment of the Fund, the NPRF Commission has in the Fund's Discretionary Portfolio increased its commitment to Irish assets within the framework of its commercial investment mandate, including to Innovation Fund Ireland, water metering and infrastructure.Cost of consultancy:Nil.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	634	As the Deputy is aware, the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland under its fiscal consolidation measures commits to the introduction of a property tax for 2012 and to an increase in the property tax for 2013.  Decisions have yet to be taken on the precise legal mechanism to be used to introduce a property tax; what form that tax will take; the extent of the tax and any exemptions or waivers therefrom; and whether it will be introduced in tax legislation such as the Finance Bill or through other legislation which may fall within the ambit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 153 together.More than 32,000 people are directly employed in international financial services, in over 500 firms.  Substantial indirect employment is also generated, and the sector contributes €2.1bn in corporate and payroll taxes to the Exchequer.  Accounting for 10% of multi-national employment, international financial services represents an estimated 7.4% of GDP, and 5% of EU international financial services activity is carried out from Ireland.The fundamental goal of public policy in relation to the IFSC is to develop the international financial services industry in Ireland, built upon sustainable, responsible and internationally respected foundations, to maximise not only the number of jobs, but also the quality of employment and the future sustainability and growth prospects of the industry.  The Government believes that it is necessary to continue to adopt, articulate and implement a clear vision for the development of the IFSC to demonstrate Ireland's commitment to the promotion and growth of its international financial services industry.As part of this, the Deputy will be aware that last week, An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny T.D., announced a new IFSC Strategy for the future of the international financial services industry in Ireland over the next 5 years.  The Strategy, which will be implemented by the Clearing House Group of the Department of the Taoiseach, sets out the key drivers to support the achievement of the overall objective of 10,000 net new jobs.  The foundations are a tax framework which is competitive and internationally respected and a regulatory regime which supports responsible business operations and ensures effective oversight and control.  The Strategy recognises and fully supports the critical importance of a credible, responsible and proportionate regulatory system whose own capacity and reputation provides, in itself, a source of competitive advantage for this jurisdiction, attracting reputable, responsible and sustainable financial services activity.As Minister for Finance, I welcome the IFSC Strategy and consider that it represents a comprehensive approach to maintaining and developing the international financial services sector in Ireland.  In this context, I do not have any immediate plans to establish a separate task force on the future of the financial service sector. I will, however, keep the situation under review.With regard to the provision for safe regulations and incentives for the financial services industry here, the Strategy recognises that it is essential to develop tax and regulatory structures within the parameters of EU and other international requirements. While the Strategy sets out a commitment to the development of the IFSC and a direction for policy development, any relevant implementing measures will be considered through the appropriate legislative or other processes, including, inter alia, consideration of relevant EU law implications, in particular around state aid rules.  The Deputy will note that a comprehensive programme of regulatory reform in the financial sector is already underway at domestic, international and EU levels which will have significant implications for the regulation of the different IFSC sectors.  My Department is engaging actively in this regulatory reform agenda in relevant international fora and it is a key objective of my Department to transpose all EU legislation in good time to ensure that both the Central Bank and industry are well placed to implement new regulatory requirements.In addition to international regulatory reform, the Deputy will also be aware that domestic legislative changes have been introduced to merge the Central Bank and Financial Regulator and to enhance the powers of the unified organisation.  Further enhancements to the Central Bank's powers will be introduced to the Oireachtas shortly in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill.  In addition, the Central Bank is engaged in a significant programme to increase its staff numbers and to enhance its supervisory capacities.

However, as I have already stated in this House, the banks are engaging in cost cutting plans which are already underway.  These cost reductions which will improve operating margins and permit the banks to better absorb any future raises in funding costs and I would expect this to be reflected in their interest rates.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I wish to inform the Deputy that there will be more Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts this year than there were last year. There is therefore no estimated budget saving. 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts are being provided for SNA support for the coming school year. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools.The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.In order to manage this limited resource, 475 of these posts will be retained for allocation over the coming school year to address significant emergency cases; new entrants with special needs; or new assessments or injuries acquired during the school year.The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of a review process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	639	The European Commission has issued proposals to extend the temporary crisis-related derogation that allows the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to be used for workers made redundant as a result of the current financial and economic crisis in addition to those losing their job under the normal qualifying scenario, namely changes in global trade patterns. This derogation is currently due to expire on 30 December 2011. The Commission's proposal would extend it until 31 December 2013, which is also the end of the current implementation period provided for under EGF Regulation (EC) No. 1927/2006.Ireland is supportive of the extension of the global financial and economic crisis derogation as it will allow for an increased number of scenarios which could trigger further applications for EGF support.Generally, the implementation period for delivery of services to EGF eligible persons commences with the date of submission of the EGF application by the EU Member State. Regulation (EC) No. 546/2009 amending Regulation (EC) No. 1927/2006 provides for an implementation period of 24 months and also allows in certain cases for this period to commence 3 months after the date of submission of the EGF application. This provision is not up for review at this time.  I do, however, understand that a review of the EGF with a possible proposal to continue it beyong 2013 is to begin in the near future.  I can assure you that Ireland will participate actively in that review process and will seek to introduce whatever measures that will improve the operation of the EGF in practice.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	640	There are 739 post primary and 3336 primary schools connected to the Schools broadband network.  In addition to this there are 78 post primary schools on the 100mb piloy project and 9 primary schools on the Hermes project.4% of post primary and 3% of primary schools are not connected to the schools broadband network.  I understand that many of the schools who have declined a connection from the Department have made their own internet connection arrangements. There is no obligation on schools to avail of a connection provided by the Department and schools are free to source their broadband from the market should they so chose. All of these schools are also free to avail of a connection provided by the Department anytime in the future.However I would encourage schools to avail of an internet service under the Schools Broadband Programme, as under the Programme connectivity to the internet is routed through a National Broadband Network, which has been developed by HEAnet — the National Education and Research Network provider. HEAnet has established a Network Operations Centre to channel and control the broadband access to schools, and it provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/anti-virus and content filtering. Access to resources such as on-line versions of Britannica and World Book are also only available through the Schools Broadband Network.

The Group has representatives from both the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as well as from my own Department.I am expecting the Group to complete a report for me by the end of 2011.

Exact delivery mechanisms of these 1,000 places have now been identified and scheduling has commenced.It is anticipated that each of these additional places will have been activated by the end of 2011.In relation to the additional 3,000 Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) and 1,000 Further Education Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) places which are to be prioritised for the unemployed, these additional places have been allocated and will be available from September.5,900 additional places for higher education and training opportunities for the unemployed have been allocated under Springboard.  Applications for all of the Springboard programmes opened on 25 May 2011 and institutions are still processing applications for courses, the majority of which will begin in September 2011.  Comprehensive information on all of the programmes the application process can be accessed through the Bluebrick.ie website.The National Internship Scheme (JobBridge), launched on 29 June, 2011, will provide up to 5,000 unemployed people with an internship opportunity ranging from 6 to 9 months in an organisation in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors.It is three weeks since the launch and there are already over 700 opportunities available on the JobBridge website (offering just over 1,000 placements).  65 Interns have been selected of which 27 have currently been verified by the Department of Social Welfare and of these 8 have commenced their internship.The Government will continue to explore new and existing programme to provide additional training, education and work experience places for the unemployed including young unemployed persons.

The terms of the leases are a matter for individual boards of management.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	649	Based on my Department's most recent statistics, it is expected that enrolments will increase nationally from a current enrolment at primary level of circa 509,652 pupils to circa 552,800 pupils by 2017 and at post-primary level from a current enrolment of circa 317,432 pupils to circa 342,300 pupils by 2017. My Department is currently examining all areas of the country to determine where additional provision will be required at both primary and post-primary level up to 2017. This analysis will inform the development of a multi-annual plan for capital investment in schools.It is within this context that I recently announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established within the next six years, comprising of twenty new primary schools and twenty new post-primary schools. Of the 40 new schools, 17 will be in the Dublin area with a further twelve in the commuter belt of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth. Six new schools will be established in Cork, three in Galway and one each in Wexford and Cavan.  In addition, it will be necessary to extend the capacity of many existing schools to meet the demand for increased pupil places.The Deputy will be aware that in January 2011, the Minister made an announcement regarding projects to enter architectural planning and to proceed to tender and construction. The announcement provided details of the major projects which make up the School Building Work Programme for 2011. The listings which accompanied the announcement provided an overview of the programme as announced and also details in relation to the current status of each project on the programme. The details in relation to the current status of the projects are updated on a regular basis as projects progress through the stages of architectural planning, tender and construction on my Department's website. The current status of all projects on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.

The current status of projects on the programme is updated on a monthly basis as projects progress from one stage to the next. The website also provides information on all projects in architectural planning which are not currently on the 2011 School Buildings Works Programme and also those projects announced in January of this year to complete brief formulations and to progress into architectural planning.In general, where no unforeseen issues arise, the tender phase on a major project takes 5-6 months to complete from the point of approval to issue the invitation to tender to the point of appointment of a building contractor. Information on the web-site in relation to those projects which complete tender stage is updated on a monthly basis.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	651	The Strategy Group Report, Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools, 2008-2013, proposes a comprehensive agenda for pursuing the integration of ICT into teaching and learning in our schools and provides an essential strategic framework which has been invaluable to my Department in enhancing and refining the ICT in Schools Programme.  As the Deputy may be aware, following publication of the Strategy Group Report, a Joint Advisory Group was commissioned to advise on specific priorities for investment in this context, and published its report  ("Smart Schools = Smart Economy") in November 2009, with a particular focus on investment priorities over the period 2010-2012.My Department has actively pursued key recommendations made in these reports within available resources. While it would not be practical to outline every individual action taken in this response, I would draw the Deputy's attention in particular to the distribution of some €92m in ICT Infrastructure Grant funding across primary and post-primary schools since November 2009. This new scheme prioritises the equipping of all classrooms with digital projectors, teaching computers, wireless mice and wireless keyboards, with schools free to spend remaining grant funding on other ICT hardware and software purchases in line with local needs. Central national "Framework" contracts have been made available to schools to assist them in getting better value for money in their ICT procurements and to provide them with the benefit of three-year next-business-day on site warranties as standard. A national programme of "elearning" seminars has also been made available to all primary and post-primary principals, to assist them in planning for the integration of ICT into teaching and learning practice and in making best use of the recent infrastructural investment.  As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is not currently in a position to commit additional resources to ICT capital investment having regard to other priorities. I am fully aware of the importance of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and remain committed to investing in this area as resources permit.

Matters in this area should be dealt with in accordance with FETAC's published guidelines.  The guidelines are available on the FETAC website, www.fetac.ie.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	653	No decision has been made in relation to the next phase of providing 100Mbps to schools. Any decision to extend the programme will be made having regard to the current budgetary constraints and other priorities of my Department. A pedagogical review of the pilot project is currently being prepared, the outcome of which will also inform future plans in this area.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	654	The new school to be provided in Co Leitrim, referred to by the Deputy, is one of eight schools which were approved for inclusion in the 3rd Bundle of schools to be procured via Public Private Partnership.  This Bundle was handed over to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) in July 2010 to commence the tender procurement process.This process is ongoing with tenders received this month. Subject to the successful completion of the procurement process, including securing the necessary Local Authority consents, it is anticipated that construction of the schools in this bundle will commence in the first quarter of 2012 and the accommodation is expected to be ready for occupation in September 2013.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The Deputy's question refers to a proposal for an academy for children with autism which was submitted to my Department for consideration by Achieve ABA. The Deputy will be aware that my Department had no direct funding arrangements with the group in question.Consideration of this proposal took account of my Department's policy in this regard, which is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.

The REV provides these details at Vote subhead level and identifies the aggregate amount of National Lottery funding towards the programmes in question, together with the amount of Exchequer funding. For example the 2011 REV indicates that total funding of €410.685 million in 2010 was financed by €250 million from the National Lottery and the remaining €160.685 was funded by the Exchequer (ref REV Appendix 1, page 235).6.1 National Lottery FundingUnder subheads B.1 and B.14, a total of €1.06 million was grant aided  in 2010 and €1.148m in 2009 to support adult education and cultural activities.

They are also decreased where a child's care needs may have diminished over time.  I wish to clarify also that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE is currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I announced my intention to establish a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector on 28th March, 2011. The Forum is a key objective of the Programme for a National Government 2011 — 2016. On 19th April, I officially launch the Forum and noted that the Advisory Group to oversee the work of the Forum would be chaired by Professor John Coolahan who would be assisted by Dr Caroline Hussey and Ms Fionnuala Kilfeather.  At the launch, the Advisory Group sought written submissions on key themes. Over 200 submissions have been received. The Advisory Group will receive and distil the various views and perspectives, will engage in further consultation and will draw from research reports and relevant literature.There was a three day open working session of the Forum on 22nd, 23rd and 24th June. This involved dialogue between the Advisory Group and thirteen main stakeholders plus the Department of Education and Skills. A recording of the three day session is available on my Department's website www.education.ie. It is planned to hold a plenary session of the Forum on 17th November where the interim considerations of the Advisory Group can be presented. Subsequent to this, the Advisory Group, which is independent of the Department of Education and Skills, will prepare a final report to be submitted to me by the end of the year.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	659	As part of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy I announced plans to limit the number of subjects which can be taken in the Junior certificate examinations to a maximum of 8 to allow more time to be spent on the development of key skills such as literacy and numeracy, and to provide for greater depth of learning. While it is my intention to limit the number of examinable subjects a student will sit to eight, there will be no restriction on the number of subjects a student can study during the three years of the junior cycle.Key objectives of the reform are to promote active learning and embed key skills, promote greater creativity and innovation, address curriculum overload and rote earning and strengthen literacy and numeracy. It is important too to put the focus on learning as opposed to examinations in what is no longer a high stakes environment. The purpose would not be to limit the range of subject choices in schools or the range of subjects available for examination purposes, but rather to make time and space for active learning, the development of key transferable skills and to reduce the focus on examinations at this stage of the cycle.  Research undertaken by the ESRI on students as they transferred from primary level and progressed through the second level system indicates that junior cycle students were taking 10 to 15 subjects for examination purposes and were stressed, and that the examinations had a negative backwash effect on the quality of their learning. It is important that we address these issues.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	660	I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 184 together.Irish 15-year old students have participated in two recent international studies of achievement levels in literacy and numeracy.  These were the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 which tested students' reading literacy, mathematical literacy and scientific literacy using traditional pencil-and-paper tests and the OECD PISA 2009 Digital Literacy Assessment which assessed students' ability to read computer-based text. Details of the performance of Irish students in these studies are available in "PISA 2009: The Performance and Progress of 15-year-olds in Ireland — Summary Report" and "Digital Reading Literacy in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA 2009): Summary of Results for Ireland", both of which have been published by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra.  The OECD PISA 2009 Digital Literacy Assessment showed that Irish students' ability to read computer-based text was significantly above the average of the 19 OECD countries that took the test. The above-average results of Irish students on the digital literacy tests contrasts with their average-level performance in the 2009 round of the traditional pencil-and-paper PISA literacy tests. These results suggest that the reading standards of Irish 15-year olds may be better than the results achieved on the traditional pencil-and-paper test in 2009 but not at the above-average levels scored by Irish students in 2000.Three reports have been commissioned by my Department that examine in further detail the performance of Irish students in the PISA 2009 assessments. Two of these have been received and published: "Comparisons of Performance in Ireland PISA 2000 to PISA 2009: A Preliminary Report to the Department of Education and Skills" which was completed by the Educational Research Centre and "Independent Review of the 2009 PISA Results for Ireland" which was completed by Statistics Canada. Both reports are available on the website of my Department and the website of the Educational Research Centre. A third report has yet to be completed by Statistics Canada.In order to provide international comparative data on the performance of Irish students at primary level, Ireland has joined the primary-school phases of the Progress on International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) and the Trends in International Maths and Science Study (TIMSS) under the auspices of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). Testing was undertaken in the sample schools in Ireland in spring of this year and the outcomes of the study are expected to be published by the IEA in December 2012.National data on the achievement of primary-school pupils in reading and mathematics is collected and published on behalf of my Department by the Educational Research Centre in the periodic National Assessments of Mathematics and English Reading. The most recent report, based on data collected in 2009 was published in 2010 and is available on the website of the Centre.

In addition, provision for expenditure of some €362 million has been made under the National Training Fund in 2011.  There are no savings or excesses being projected on the estimate at this stage. However, my Department will closely monitor the spending situation over the months ahead with a view to ensuring that Government expenditure is maintained within the limits available.

This process, which will be completed by end September, will inform budgetary decisions. In this context, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not presently in a position to comment on specific areas of expenditure within my Department.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I announced my intention to establish a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector on 28th March, 2011. An Advisory Group, under the Chairmanship of Professor John Coolahan, is overseeing the work of the Forum.The terms of reference of the Forum are very specific. They are to advise me on: 1. how it can best be ensured that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none; 2. the practicalities of how transfer/divesting of patronage should operate for individual primary schools in communities where it is appropriate and necessary; 3. how such transfer/divesting can be advanced to ensure that demands for diversity of patronage (including from an Irish language perspective) can be identified and met on a widespread basis nationally.In undertaking this work the Forum will, in particular, have regard for the following:the expressed willingness of the Roman Catholic Church to consider divesting patronage of primary schoolsthe current financial constraints within which the State is operating, the need for continued restraint into the future and the requirement in this context to make maximum use of existing school infrastructure in catering for future demands.  The Advisory Group which is independent of the Department will prepare a final report, based on the above terms of reference, and this will be submitted to me by the end of the year.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	664	I wish to confirm for the Deputy that 10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the coming school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. For example, it represents an increase over the December 2010 position where 10,543 posts were sanctioned and in place.The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published a Value for Money and Policy Analysis review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme. This review is available on my Departments website: www.education.ie.  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs. However, it is clear that the allocation process is generally not well understood within schools and by parents nor is the purpose of the Scheme fully understood.  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the ‘care’ nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals. The review did not recommend a change in the role of the SNA.  The DES is currently establishing a working group which will consider and implement the recommendations of the SNA Value for Money report.

The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application form, including those relating to distance from home to college, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant or what level of grant would be appropriate.  However, for the 2011/12 academic year, the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of student grant is 45kms.  The Deputy will be aware that this change was introduced by his Government under Budget 2011.Students qualifying for a grant and living 45kms or less from their college will receive the adjacent rate of grant and their fees or student contribution will be paid on their behalf.  Students on particularly low incomes will receive a top-up in the special rate of grant and €5m continues to be available through the access offices of third level institutions for students in exceptional financial need.

It is not possible, therefore, for me to say what the distance calculation or route for an individual student will or should be.  However, the shortest most direct route to college is measured. If there is a dispute, this matter should be taken up with the grant awarding authority.

A decision was taken in recent weeks that the Department will re-tender the project directly. It is anticipated that construction work will resume on the project in the coming months.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The changes to the student grants scheme to which the Deputy refers were introduced by the previous Fianna Fáil — Green Party Government under Budget 2011.  These changes alter the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24kms to 45kms and remove the automatic entitlement of mature students to the non-adjacent rate of grant.  While these measures will result in changes to the rate of grant payable, none of the measures will result in a student losing a grant or becoming ineligible for a grant.All student grants applications are means tested and qualifying students receive the rate of grant available under the scheme in accordance with their individual circumstances.  Students on particularly low incomes will continue to receive a "top-up" in the special rate of maintenance grant and the Student Assistance Fund at some €5m continues to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.

This includes the allocation of resource teaching hours to schools as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such supports.I understand that the ‘special needs unit' referred to by the Deputy is a special class for pupils with Autism. I wish to clarify for the Deputy in respect of special classes that schools are required to observe Department policy in enrolling children to these classes. This includes having a professional assessment confirming that the child's attainment levels meet the Department's criteria and a recommendation for special class placement. As such, enrolment in the special class in question is confined to pupils with a diagnosis of Autism. Schools are eligible for resources for special classes when the pupils enrolled meet the Department's criteria and where there are enough eligible pupils to retain a class.Second level schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with Down Syndrome with an assessed special educational need, are allocated additional resource teaching support on the basis of the pupil's special educational needs. The number of additional teaching hours sanctioned ranges from one-and-a-half hours to five hours per week, depending on the pupil's special educational needs.

This has reduced the usage of prefabricated accommodation, with the majority of schools opting to build permanent classroom extensions instead of purchasing or renting prefabs.  In 2010, €50.7m was approved by my Department under this scheme, of which €6.6m was used by 52 schools to purchase prefabricated buildings.  In relation to 2011 it is not possible at this time to identify how many schools will opt to purchase prefabs however it is expected that the usage will be similar to 2010.

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.My Department's Circular 0042/2011 provides details of the staffing arrangements which will apply for special schools for the coming school year. This Circular outlines that current teaching staff levels will be retained in Special Schools for the 2011/12 school year at existing levels, except in the case of schools with excess teaching posts who are losing such posts through retirement.  The Circular also sets out that Special Schools, going forward, will be staffed based on their actual current pupil profiles and the disability category of each pupil, as opposed to primarily by school designation. It is intended that school staffing schedules will be reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE.It is open to the school concerned to contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) regarding their staffing allocation, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I regret I am not in a position to visit the school in the near future due to diary constraints. However, I wish to acknowledge the valuable contribution made by Special Schools to the continuum of provision being made for children with special educational needs.

I am aware of the excellent work the youngballymun project does in an area of severe socioeconomic disadvantage.There are existing wholly State-funded intervention programmes for young children at risk of educational disadvantage. The Early Start programme aims to provide an educational programme for children aged 3-4 which would enhance their overall development and offset the effects of social disadvantage. The specific objectives of the programme are: To enhance the children's language cognitive and social / emotional development by engaging them in structured play activities which are characterised by high quality adult/child interaction. To assess the strengths and needs of each child in relation to language, cognition and social / emotional development and to plan and deliver a programme of learning to meet the identified needs in these key areas of learning. To devise strategies which actively engage parents in the education of their children.The Early Start programme has been in existence since the mid 1990s and this programme along with the Rutland St pre-school programme were, until recently, the only wholly State funded educational programmes for pre-school children. In recent years, the State along with Atlantic Philanthropies have funded Prevention and Early Intervention Programmes in areas of disadvantage. These include YoungBallymun, Tallaght's Childhood Development Initiative and the Preparing for Life Programme in Darndale.  The evidence accruing from these intervention programmes as to what works most effectively for young children at risk of educational disadvantage will inform any further targeted interventions.

I wish to advise the Deputy that a suitable site has been identified for the proposed school and my Department is working with the local authority to acquire this site.  When the site is acquired, a project for the school will be considered within the context of my Department's Multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, and the position relating to the potential site, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

These payments were made during the years 2010/2011 and arose from the award of a contract to run the Financial Services Ireland Career Start programme. The Career Start Programme, which is funded by the Labour Market Activation Fund, is designed to provide employees with the skills, support and experience to enable them to enter the International Financial Services sector and to access sustainable employment.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	682	I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 and 209 together.In July 2009, the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommended that the number of VECs could be reduced from 33 to 22 and aligned with the functional areas of the 22 Local Authorities, also recommended by the Group.  In September 2009 the then Minister for Education and Science invited interested parties to make written submission in relation to a reduction in the number of VECs.Arising from this process, the previous Government decided in October 2010 to reduce the overall number of VECs from 33 to 16 and agreed on the merger of particular counties.At the core of the proposed restructuring is the need to address the current low scale and size of operations in particular VECs in order to position the sector for future development. In this regard, the previous Government decided on a reduction to 16 new entities.On entering office, I invited the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) to submit alternative rationalisation proposals following their expression of concerns regarding the configuration of the revised entities decided by the previous Government. The IVEA subsequently submitted a proposal that involved 20 new entities.I am satisfied that having regard to cost and critical mass considerations, a reduction to 16 new entities is appropriate. Consequently, while the new configuration takes account of the IVEA submission to the greatest extent possible, it does not modify the reduction from 33 to 16 in the number of VECs decided by the previous Government.In this new configuration, eleven of the new entities match the IVEA proposal. In addition, the IVEA proposals to merge City of Galway VEC with Co. Galway VEC, Co. Sligo VEC with Co. Leitrim VEC and City of Waterford VEC with Co. Waterford VEC have also been reflected, albeit with the inclusion an additional county in each case.  Only three of the existing entities will continue, City of Dublin on the basis of overall scale; and Co. Donegal and Co. Kerry on the basis of their peripheral geographic location.It was the previous Government that decided to maintain City of Cork and County Cork as separate entities. The recent Government decision to merge City of Cork and County Cork VECs aligns the position in Cork with that planned for Limerick, Waterford and Galway.

The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application form, including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant. The student in question should, therefore, apply to her local grant awarding authority to have her eligibility for a grant assessed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	684	Revised Leaving Certificate syllabi were submitted by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in relation to the four Leaving Certificate technology subjects in 2004. Two of these subjects, Technology and Design and Graphic Communications were introduced in September 2007. The remaining two subjects, Leaving Certificate Engineering Technology and Architectural Technology are awaiting implementation.Both subjects require significant investment in equipment and professional development for teachers, and the resources for this are not available at the current time. The major priority for the present government is to raise standards in literacy and numeracy. The Programme for Government contains a determination to make literacy a national cause and as a result, this policy goal will have to be prioritised over other curricular  reforms. It is my intention to proceed with the Maths and Irish reforms which are under way, to strengthen literacy and numeracy, and reform junior cycle provision to allow for greater creativity and innovation, embedding key skills and addressing curriculum overload.While I agree that it would be desirable to implement the revised Leaving Certificate Engineering Technology and Architectural Technology curricula, it is also essential to have sustained and cumulative reductions in public expenditure over the coming years. It is regrettable that when the public finances were in a much better position under the last government, in which the Deputy served, that significant reforms like this were never implemented.

Its reports are disseminated directly to education and training providers, third level institutions and provide a valuable input to the development and amendment of course curricula.Expert Group on Future Skills Needs research and engagement between higher education providers and industry also informed the development and selection of the part time higher education programmes being funded through Springboard. Under this new initiative 6,000 places are being provided for unemployed people in areas where employment opportunities are expected to arise in the future, ranging from the food industry to ICT to green technology and international services.My Department and the Higher Education Authority, in collaboration with the Secretariat to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs are also working closely with the ICT industry to develop further responses to specific skills needs that have been identified by that sector.In addition, the Labour Market Activation Fund provided a mix of programmes covering a broad spectrum of activities in potential high growth areas of the economy. This programme is being evaluated and this evaluation will inform Government policy and decisions on the focus of upskilling programmes in the context of relevant skills needs of the Labour Market.

I wish to clarify that SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.My Department's Circular 0042/2011 provides details of the staffing arrangements which will apply for special schools for the coming school year. This Circular outlines that, other than for special schools which have declining enrolments, the existing levels of SNA support will be maintained in special schools for the coming school year, with a review to take place in the Autumn.

This provision is in line with expenditure in 2010 and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut.  This Government is committed to the protection of front-line services for pupils with special educational needs.A total of 10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the coming school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. For example, it represents an increase over the December 2010 position where 10,543 posts were sanctioned and in place.Approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation model, are also being provided in primary & post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs. This represents an increase of approximately 350 whole time equivalent posts over last year's allocation.Over 1,000 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios e.g. autism PTR is 6:1; moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.  Enhanced levels of school capitation are payable to most special schools and special classes and special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities are provided at a cost of over €60m per year.  Approximately €1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support.Early educational intervention is provided for children with autism from 2½ years of age. There are now 56 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department. Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2½ years to 5 who are unable to access an early intervention class.  An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism.In all, €1.3bn has been allocated in the 2011 budget to support pupils with special educational needs. This level of expenditure represents a significant commitment to special education provision at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I wish to restate that the Teaching Council is the body with statutory responsibility for the registration of teachers including the recognition of teaching qualifications and neither I nor my Department have a role in this process.I have made enquiries with the Council regarding their procedures and I understand that the situation is as follows.  The Teaching Council assesses applications for registration having regard to set criteria. For the purposes of post primary registration, the Council assesses the transcripts of each individual applicant undergraduate degree to determine if the subject criteria for a post-primary curricular subject have been met.In assessing degrees in engineering for the purposes of meeting the criteria for Mathematics, the Council examines qualifications transcripts to determine that there is coverage of mathematical content to the order of 54 ECTS credits throughout the degree. The study of mathematics should typically include algebra, analysis, geometry and statistics/probability, all of which are essential in the teaching of Mathematics in Post-primary schools.  In assessing degrees for Applied Mathematics, the 54 ECTS of Applied Mathematics should include a major element of Mechanics or Mathematical Physics in addition to less major study in algebra, analysis, geometry and statistics/probability.The Council has found over recent years that the mathematical content studied by two students on the one programme in engineering can vary based on the modular options chosen by each student in his/her degree.  This could result in one of the students meeting the criteria for mathematics where the other does not. In some cases where an applicant has an engineering degree and additional qualifications containing the study of mathematics, he/she may request that the Council assess the combination of two qualifications which may lead to the outcome that combination of the two qualifications meets the subject criteria. It is for these reasons that the Council may appear to recognise qualifications in engineering on a differing basis.

In other instances trainees are informed at the outset of the course that application for the licence must be done individually by the trainee.It is important to point out that in instances where the individual trainee is responsible for the application they are eligible to apply for funding under the Technical Employment Support Grant.I understand that it is the intention of FÁS to conduct a full review of policy in this area in order to establish a consistent approach across all FÁS regions.

My Department wrote directly to the person referred to by the Deputy on 28th June 2011 (and again on 12th July following further correspondence) informing the person of the position.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational resources to be allocated to pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO. The consideration of professional reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs. The NCSE has outlined the processes involved in the consideration of applications for special needs supports in its Circular 01/05 which is available on www.ncse.ie.I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE is currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.

The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.

In addition work is ongoing in my Department with regard to the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill which provides for the amalgamation of the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC, a commitment in the Programme for Government. The new body is to be known as the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland (QQAAI).In relation to the number of staff employed by my Department I can confirm that the figure as of 1st January 2011 was 1,270 compared to 885 in December 1997 — both Whole time Equivalent (WTE) figures. A significant factor in the increase in figures has been the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).

In addition, no fees are paid to board members in relation to any of the other bodies under the aegis of my Department except as outlined below.In the case of both the Residential Institutions Redress Board (RIRB) and the Residential Institutions Review Committee (RIRC) ordinary members are paid a per diem rate which in both cases is currently €668 per day (pension abatement applies were appropriate).  While it may be the case that fees for ordinary members of both of these bodies could exceed €50,000 p.a. the Deputy should note that the per diem rate paid in respect of both the RIRB and RIRC was the subject of an initial reduction of 8% from 1st March 2009 and a further reduction of 12% from 1st January 2011.  The Chairperson of the RIRC is paid by the Department based on annual salary for a Supreme Court judge subject to abatement. The Chairperson of the RIRB is a current member of the Judiciary who is not paid by the Board.In addition ordinary members of the Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse (CICA) were salaried — however they are no longer on the payroll while  the Chairperson is a member of the Judiciary who is not paid by the CICA.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. In addition, you may be aware that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and passed Committee and Remaining Stages in the Seanad on 8 March 2011. It is now before the Dáil.  In this regard, my colleague, the Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, recently met Senator Feargal Quinn with a view to continuing a collaborative approach in regard to advancing the Construction Contracts Bill 2010. The Senator's Bill is a   welcome initiative and I understand that Minister Hayes has agreed to work closely with the Senator in bringing the matter forward.I also understand that Minister Hayes and Senator Quinn held a meeting with relevant stakeholders and opposition spokespersons on 28th June. This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that require further consideration. In light of this, a Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Bill is now under way in my Department.Following these steps, it will be possible to bring proposals to the Government about how we should progress this legislation. It is intended to have the legislation before the Dáil in the next session.It is important that a solution to the problem of non-payment in the construction sector must not place an unnecessary regulatory or cost burden on the parties to the dispute, other parties involved in the project, or the State.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	717	The last Government decided, in the context of the serious national budgetary position, that retired public service pensioners should make a contribution to the overall required fiscal adjustment. This decision was taken having regard to the gap between the burden being borne by those currently in public service employment (where the pension related deduction (PRD) and pay reduction have impacted) and their retired counterparts.The measure concerned, known as the Public Service Pension Reduction, was legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, which was signed into law by the President on 22 December 2010.  Section 2 of that Act provides that the public service pension of a pensioner will be reduced.  This provision came into operation on 1 January 2011.The reduction applies to all public service pensions above €12,000 payable to or in respect of persons retired from all parts of the public service including the civil service, local government, the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána, non-commercial State Bodies and the health and education sectors.The measure averages some 4% and is tapered and therefore makes a greater reduction from those with larger public service pensions. Former public servants in receipt of high pensions, including former members of the Government and the Oireachtas and other former office holders, including the Judiciary, will bear the highest reduction.The reduction applies in a standard manner to public service pensions, whether those pensions are contributory or non-contributory, and whether or not the pensions have been boosted by purchase of added years and whether they are made to the public servant or former public servant or to a survivor. The amount of reduction in each case is determined by application of the following set of annual pension income bands and associated reduction rates:First €12,000 — 0%;Between €12,000 and €24,000 — 6%;Between €24,000 and €60,000 — 9%;Above €60,000 — 12%.The reduction in public service pensions should be placed in the context of the general moderation in inflation, i.e. the CPI is now no more than about 1% above 2007 levels, whereas public service pensioners received general round increases linked to pay of 2% in June 2007, 2.5% from March 2008 and 2.5% in September 2008 — an increase of around 7%.In all the circumstances, including in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Support, of which the public service pension reduction is an element, the Government believes it is a painful but necessary measure which will help restore order to the public finances.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 and 249 together.I have no plans to establish a commission to examine levels of pay and establish key pay relativities in the private and public sectors of the economy. Apart from instances where statutory rates of pay apply, pay rates in the private sector are generally a matter for negotiation between individual employers and employees.With regard to other sectors, the Government is committed to improving the competitiveness of the economy. In this regard the Government under the EU/IMF Programme is removing restrictions as follows.  In the legal profession, establishing an independent regulator for the profession and implementing recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group and outstanding Competition Authority recommendations to reduce legal costs; in medical services, eliminating restrictions on the number of general practitioners qualifying and removing restrictions on those wishing to treat public patients as well as restrictions on advertising; in the pharmacy profession, ensuring that  the recent elimination of the 50% mark up paid for medicines under the State Drugs Payments Scheme is enforced.   The implementation of these commitments are matters for the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Health respectively in the first instance.My responsibilities in relation to pay extend to the public service where the Government has a direct role in the determination of pay rates as employer. Pay rates in the public service have already been reduced by up to 15% and a progressive pension related reduction applied through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009. More recently, the Government accepted my proposals to introduce a general pay ceiling of €200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service, a general pay ceiling of €250,000 for   future appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies and a voluntary waiver system of up to 15% for current post holders who have salaries in excess of the relevant pay ceiling.

To date I have visited a large number of heritage sites and I will continue to travel around the country to visit other sites and to hold discussions with local groups and communities who are interested in the development of tourism using our national wealth of built heritage.I have recently instructed my officials to produce proposals that will allow local organisations, working in partnership with the OPW, to help to transform tourism potential in their area by working in partnership with the OPW in the presentation of these sites. There will always be public liability, health and safety and industrial relations issues attached to decisions like this but we can address these and work towards providing solutions to these challenges in order to make progress. I have invited community groups to submit proposals on the future development and use of heritage sites and we will evaluate those proposals as I am looking to set up a number of pilot projects to work in partnership with the OPW in the presentation of heritage sites.Referring specifically to the Monasterboice site: a conservation study was commissioned jointly by Louth County Council, the Office of Public Works and the National Monuments Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The recommendations suggested by this study will be considered by a group consisting of Louth County Council, the National Monuments service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works. We are now moving towards the implementation of these recommendations and the process of setting up an implementation group has already commenced. There is a need to view this site in a holistic manner, which includes signage with all the stakeholders included in the process.In relation to the Grianán of Aileach stone fort; there has been a history of collapses to different sections of the wall at the fort dating back to at least the 1800s and the OPW workforce has undertaken re-instatement works on a number of occasions as a result.There is an ongoing program of conservation and preservation at this site and right through the process of consolidating the monument, the OPW has ensured that the site remained open to all tourists. There is a joint access arrangement with Donegal County Council with regard to the car park at the site, which is under their care, and there has always been a good working arrangement between OPW, the Local Authority and also the local community.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	733	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. In addition, you may be aware that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and passed Committee and Remaining Stages in the Seanad on 8 March 2011. It is now before the Dáil.In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Mr. Brian Hayes recently met with Senator Feargal Quinn with a view to continuing a collaborative approach in regard to advancing the Construction Contracts Bill 2010. The Senator's Bill is a welcome initiative and I understand that Minister Hayes has agreed to work closely with the Senator in bringing the matter forward.I also understand that Minister Hayes and Senator Quinn held a meeting with relevant stakeholders and opposition spokespersons on 28th June. This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that require further consideration. In light of this, a Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Bill is now underway in my Department.Following these steps, it will be possible to bring proposals to the Government about how we should progress this legislation. It is intended to have the legislation before the Dáil in the next session.It is important that a solution to the problem of non-payment in the construction sector must not place an unnecessary regulatory or cost burden on the parties to the dispute, other parties involved in the project, or the State.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	734	In 2010, the total  number of visitors attending the 20 most popular Heritage Sites in the country was about 2 million.    Some sites such as Glenveagh and Muckross House are under the auspices of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and from returns available to the Office of Public Works, these sites recorded 146,000 visitors in 2010.Visitor Returns for 2010 show a small decrease {0.06%} when compared to the 2009 data.  This, however, was an excellent performance given that tourist numbers in general were down.In early 2010, the volcanic ash cloud affected all sites, with a greater impact on the larger sites where foreign Tour Groups were unable fly into the country and take up their bookings.  The exceptionally bad weather at the beginning of the year also had an impact.All sites were open on a seven-day week basis throughout the peak tourist season.   However, due to resources constraints, it was necessary to shorten the season at some sites.This year, the number of visitors to the Rock of Cashel has increased as a direct result of the recent very successful Royal visit to the site.I introduced an initiative recently giving the individual visitor free admission on the first Wednesday of every month for the rest of the year to all OPW-managed fee-paying Heritage Sites. It is my hope that this will encourage a greater  interest in our built heritage by a wider audience  both tourist and  all communities living in Ireland  and that people will be motivated to return sometime in the future to learn more.

As one measure to achieve this, the guidance advises that the sub-dividing of procurement requirements into "lots" should be considered by contracting authorities where it would be appropriate and practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.As regards promoting employment of local labour, the award of public contracts is governed by EU Treaty principles and Directives on public procurement. The provisions of the EU Directives allow contracting authorities to attach social conditions to the performance of contracts, provided these are compatible with EU law.  In this regard, EU law requires that such conditions must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States. Specifying such conditions is a matter for the contracting authority concerned, having regard to the foregoing considerations.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	737	The Office of Public Works advertised in the media seeking a site locally for a new Garda Station in Bunbeg and have received a number of replies.Sites have been assessed for suitability and the OPW are now in a position to commence negotiations with the site owners.The acquisition of a site at Bunbeg will depend on various factors, crucially the availability of funds which, as you can appreciate in the current difficult climate, are extremely limited.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	738	It is the position of the Office of Public Works that the flood defence works undertaken, or funded, by the OPW should always be taken into account in the provision and cost of flood insurance.Under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works & Coastal Protection Scheme funding may be provided by the Office of Public Works to local authorities, to undertake minor flood mitigation measures to address localised flooding and coastal erosion problems within their administrative areas.In the period 2010-2011 OPW has funded approximately €2.4m under the Minor Works scheme to both the City and County Councils in respect of the Cork city area.   Some €900,000 of this funding has been provided to Cork City Council to commission works for the repair of the quay walls which were breached in the 2009 flood event.The major flood relief study on the River Lee catchment is being finalised at present.  Following completion of the study it is proposed to engage consultants to carry out detailed design of the lower Lee flood defence works and to examine possible changes in operational procedures for Inniscarra dam.In the meantime, the OPW continues to review operational protocols with the ESB in respect of outflows controlled by them in the Lee river catchment.  In this regard, following a request from the OPW, ESB put in place interim measures, prior to the implementation of the CFRAMS process, on a pilot basis for the winter period 2010-2011, to provide additional flood protection downstream of Inniscarra.  This involved reducing the spill level in Inniscarra and Carrigadrohid by 0.5m.I met, earlier this month, with representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) to review the interchange of information sharing between  the OPW and the insurance industry with a view to ensuring that the industry is fully cognisant of the substantial capital investment made by the State in flood prevention measures over many years, both in respect of major and minor works.The OPW is in the process of supplying detailed mapping of areas nationally which have benefitted from capital flood works.  In addition the IIF has agreed to take up membership of the national stakeholder group of the Catchment Flood Risk, Assessment and Management programme to be established later this year.The IIF has reassured me that the vast majority of properties are covered by flood insurance at present.To this end, my Office will continue its liaison with the Irish Insurance Federation in 2011 and will endeavour to assist in any practical way with keeping the IIF fully informed as to its various programmes of flood alleviation, which should be taken into account in informing applications for flood insurance.

This will occur when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been established to protect consumer interests. Following publication of the Report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities in April, my Department sought the considered views of relevant Departments on the Review Group's recommendations. Having considered these views, I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly on the matter. Under the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has agreed to discuss its plans with the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB when it has finalised its response to the Review Group Report.  This is to take place by the end of the year.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	740	As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance recently announced this Government's Jobs Initiative. The Initiative provided for a further €30 million for school works and associated works in 2011 over the existing allocation. Some €20 million of this is being reallocated by the Minister for Education and Skills from within his own Department's allocation. A further €10 million of Exchequer funding has been made available to the Department from the proceeds of the new pension levy also announced in the Initiative.  This is to be allocated to immediately-ready projects to be delivered by schools.  The Initiative also provided for an additional €60 million to be reallocated from within the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport's overall allocation to invest in our regional and local roads to carry out much-needed surface restoration and road reconstruction works. This important remedial work is overdue and the additional money invested will allow local authorities to bring forward important projects to 2011 that had previously been pushed back to 2012.We are currently undertaking a major review across Government of our capital investment programme with a view to ensuring that allocations are prioritised towards those capital projects and programmes  that will maximise economic benefits to the state, promote sustainable jobs growth in the medium term an address immediate and urgent social deficits.

The criteria for being subject to the pension-related deduction are, essentially, that one is a public servant (defined in section 1 of the Act) anda) is a member of a public service pension scheme (defined in section 1 of the Act) orb) is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme orc) receives a payment in lieu of membership in such a scheme.A public servant not covered by the above criteria would not be subject to the deduction.  The determination of liability in the case of an individual is a matter for the individual's employer in the first instance as it depends on the specific employment circumstances.  In this regard, the question of whether the legislation and the deduction apply to staff in Vocational Educational Committees or State sponsored bodies is a matter for their employer and any clarification queries are a matter for the parent Department.Fixed-term and non-permanent workers across many areas of the public service are paying the deduction.  In this general connection, such service is generally pensionable and, even for relatively short periods in such posts, pensionable service is accrued. It may also be transferred in the future to any public service employment. If the service is not transferred, section 6 of the Act provides for a refund of the deduction in certain limited circumstances, essentially in those cases where, on leaving employment, the pension scheme member has not accrued sufficient service to build up a benefit in any public service pension scheme.

The Government expect that this will go beyond simply abolishing agencies and also consider issues such as how existing agencies might be reformed, how functions might be reallocated among them, and how different bodies within and beyond individual Ministers' remit might be brought together on a repurposed, streamlined basis.The question of rationalization and the reduction in the number of state agencies will be considered in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the overall budgetary and estimates process for 2012 and later years.

The CRE will be a critical building block in formulating Government's budgetary policy for 2012 and beyond and the results of the Comprehensive Review process will be brought before Government for consideration and decision in the Budget and Estimates process later this year. The Oireachtas will have the opportunity to debate the Government's decisions arising from the CRE as part of the Budget debate, and in more detail in the 2012 Estimate debate at the relevant Select Committees.More generally, while the detailed arrangements for the budgetary process in the autumn are still under consideration, I anticipate that the CRE exercise will have a significant bearing on the Pre-Budget Outlook (PBO) to be presented to Dáil Éireann in October.In addition, the CRE will form a key input to the establishment of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) later this year. This Framework will form part of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill to be put before the House and the Oireachtas will input in this context.

In recent times, the Government's financial position is of course particularly difficult, and a moratorium on the filling of vacancies arising in all Departments, Offices and agencies has been in operation since early 2009.  At present, a comprehensive review of all Government expenditure is in train for completion later this year and to inform Government decisions on spending, including on staff numbers in Departments and agencies, in 2012 and later years.Against this background, the Government is however determined to facilitate the delivery of the industrial employment and other targets in the current IDA Strategy.  To achieve this, IDA is amongst those who have been approved, through consultation with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in recent times to fill mission-critical vacancies that would otherwise have remained vacant under the moratorium.The allocation of IDA staff to the various locations throughout the country and worldwide is a day to day operational matter for the Agency and not one in which I have a function. I understand from the IDA that it's Letterkenny office is not closing. IDA has sought Department of Finance sanction for a new North West Regional Manager. In Letterkenny, IDA will maintain its office and staff employed there. IDA will continue to maintain two offices in the North West region.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21312	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	752	Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  It is only by creating the right environment for businesses to expand that we will see new jobs coming on stream.  In this context, the objective of the Jobs Initiative announced on 10 May is to put policies in place to improve the business environment in Ireland, drive competitiveness, continue to grow our exports, and restore confidence in the economy, both internationally and domestically.  The Jobs Initiative will support the maintenance of existing jobs, as well facilitating the creation of new ones.  The Initiative includes a range of measures, which will be taken across all Government Departments — including my own — to stimulate the economy and help get people back to work.The Programme for Government recognises that economic recovery must be export-led. Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy   is an integrated strategy that is global in scope and covers both existing and new high growth potential markets.  It has set a number of ambitious targets to be achieved by end 2015 i.e. to create 150,000 new jobs (manufacturing, tourism and traded services).  The jobs total figure of 150,000 direct new jobs, is from agency estimates based on their growth targets over the Strategy period to the end of 2015 i.e. 75,000 (IDA Ireland), 60,000 (Enterprise Ireland) and 15,000 in the tourism sector.  The strategy also foresees the creation of a similar number of new indirect jobs.Enterprise Ireland's focus is export led sales growth in its client companies leading to jobs growth.  Regarding sector, the software and internationally traded services sectors, cleantech, information and communications technology, life sciences and food are targeted to deliver the majority of new jobs, both from existing companies and new high potential start-ups.  Enterprise Ireland client companies are widely dispersed throughout Ireland and the agency are actively engaged in seeking to support those companies with the appetite for growth and the commitment to building their capability to achieve it.Enterprise Ireland will support the achievement of its job creation targets through a number of key interventions such as:support for start-ups, R&D and Innovation, and securing exports;supporting the establishment and growth of High Potential Start-Ups;supporting companies to target new opportunities in overseas markets;continuing to be focused on supporting company investments;continuing to invest in R&D both in terms of in-company investments; andby supporting the commercialisation of Ireland's research.FDI has been, and will continue to be, a key element in the export led recovery of the economy. IDA will focus on winning new investments in areas such as Global Services, High End Manufacturing and Research, Development and Innovation.  IDA will also target new investments from sectors such as Life Sciences, Medical Devices, Information and Communications Technology, Financial Services, Content Industry, Consumer and Business Services, Diversified Industries and Engineering and Clean Technologies.  Building on existing regional strengths to ensure Ireland's economic development and optimising regional spread of overseas investments is central to IDA core activities.  Fifty per cent of these investments are to be based in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  A growing proportion of FDI will come from high-growth markets new to Ireland.There is evidence that our policies are working.  Yesterday's €50m investment by Analog Devices Limerick, together with today's announcements of new investments from Belgian, Dutch and US companies, in addition to the announcement by Allianz, and another expected announcement tomorrow from a world leading company will see over 560 new jobs created.  IDA expect the strong flow of foreign direct investment to continue through 2011.

The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies to support enterprise and innovation so that quality employment opportunities can be grown and maintained.  It is only by creating the right environment for businesses to expand that we will see new jobs coming on stream.  On 10 May, the Government launched a €500m Jobs Initiative which has the objective of:restoring confidence in the economy, both internationally and domestically, supporting the maintenance of existing jobs, and facilitating the creation of new ones, improving the business environment and assisting people to get back to work.Many of these measures have already been brought into effect, including the reduction of VAT on restaurant and catering services, hotel and holiday accommodation and various entertainment services; the halving of the lower rate of employer's PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week; the launch of the National Internship scheme; and the focusing of the State's capital expenditure towards more employment-intensive projects in the areas of education, local and regional roads and sustainable transport projects.The Jobs Initiative also made commitments to introduce a Loan Guarantee scheme and a Microfinance Start up Fund, to improve access to finance for businesses.  My Department is currently working on developing these schemes and my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation expects to be in a position to announce details of the schemes within the next six months.The Programme for Government also outlines a number of measures, which the Government will take to assist small and medium enterprises with a view to maximising their potential in the context of economic recovery.  These measures will build on the existing enterprise supports available to small businesses through the City and County Enterprise Boards and Enterprise Ireland.  All of the measures I have outlined — along with other commitments in the Programme for Government — will contribute to facilitating job creation and retention.

Planning for this event is being coordinated by the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government.  Hosting City of Science will serve three functions. It willprovide a platform to showcase the best of Irish science and research across all disciplines;boost the international standing of Ireland as a leading centre for scientific and research excellence and to provide a framework to demonstrate the world class research system that we have built over the last decade; and,promote careers in science, technology engineering and maths among prospective students and their parents.With regard to the third function, on 6 April last I announced a call for proposals for a year-long programme of events to engage the citizens of the island of Ireland in science.  The intention is to devise a programme of events that will demonstrate the reach of science into almost every aspect of our lives — education, business, the arts, sports and our communities.  Partnerships are being sought with organisations and individuals who wish to develop events that will encourage the public to engage with science.The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser has confirmed that, when this call closed at end June, over 320 proposals had been received from across the island.  An initial overview of these proposals shows strong elements of creativity, diversity and concern to make science more accessible to the citizen.  The proposals are currently being assessed and it is planned to produce a first outline of a programme of outreach activities in the Autumn.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21312	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 and 309 together.Digital gaming is one of a number of key sectors which I see as offering strong potential for growth and increased employment in Ireland.  The global video games market was valued at US$55.5 billion in 2010 and is expected to grow to US$82.5 billion by 2015, making it the fastest growing segment of the wider entertainment and media sector.  It is a rapidly moving marketplace and one where Ireland could become a significant player.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to support the digital games industry and promote Ireland as a digital gaming hub.  The sector directly employed 1,500 people in Ireland in 2010 in core games companies, representing a fourfold increase since 2004, with a further 1,000 employed people in online gambling.  There is considerable potential for jobs growth in the core video games sector, with further potential for growth across related sectors and activities, such as eLearning, animation, etc.I met recently with representatives from the Digital Gaming industry to discuss how we could further develop the sector.  At present, Forfás is preparing a report for me on the potential of the industry.  The report will identify key actions that need to be taken to optimise the development of Digital Gaming in Ireland. I expect to receive the report from Forfás before the end of this month and I will give it early consideration.  I will seek the support of my Government colleagues, as necessary, to take appropriate actions required to further develop the sector on foot of the report.The Programme for Government pointed to the R&D tax credit as a means of further enhancing Ireland's attractiveness to the digital game industry.  Detailed consultations have been underway in recent months involving my Department, the enterprise agencies and representatives of the many active and growing games companies operating in Ireland.  These discussions have included in-depth examination of those elements of the games development process that fall within the provisions of the R&D tax credit to ensure they are fully understood and availed of by the industry and also to determine where there might be room for enhancement.Innovation Fund Ireland is part of a suite of policy initiatives to position Ireland as a Global Innovation Hub.  The overall objective of the Innovation Fund is not just to increase the availability and diversity of smart capital for start-up and scaling firms, but also to transform the market by attracting top tier fund managers to Ireland and support the further development of the venture capital sector.  The extent to which the Digital Games sector will attract financing will become clearer over time.In the meantime, companies can compete for funding under Enterprise Ireland's new Internet and Games Competitive Start Fund.  Enterprise Ireland set up the new Fund as a mechanism to get financial support into very early stage companies at the critical product-market fit stage of their projects.In March, I announced the 10 companies that had been successful under the first call under the Fund.    Each of the ten companies receives an equity investment of €50,000 for a 10% ordinary equity stake, along with the support of an experienced business mentor to guide them as they develop their business.  Following the huge interest in this first call, Enterprise Ireland expanded its offer with a second fund (Competitive Start Fund) that is also open to software companies in the games, telecoms, software as a service (SaaS), cloud computing and enterprise software sectors.With regard to skills shortages, over the past few months, my Department's officials have been working with the Secretariat to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills to more precisely clarify issues in relation to skills gaps in the ICT sector as a whole and how they might be addressed.  Discussions have taken place with over 25 foreign-owned and indigenous companies to establish information on the scale and nature of issues involved and the reasons for reported difficulties.The Minister for Education and Skills, Minister Quinn, has confirmed his commitment to work collaboratively with the sector on measures to increase the longer term supply of graduates, and to address the skills needs of the sector in the interim through an expansion of conversion and re-skilling courses.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21312	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	766	In Ireland the National Consumer Agency (NCA) is responsible for product safety of non-food consumer products including window blinds. I am informed that the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have no responsibility in relation to window blinds.  The NCA has been actively working to promote consumer awareness of window blind cord safety over the past number of years.  As part of this role the Agency has produced a brochure entitled ‘Consumer Guide to the Safety of Window Blinds'.  This brochure was prepared in cooperation with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) and includes consumer tips in relation to what to look out for when buying new blinds as well as advice on how to minimise risks posed by blinds already installed in homes.At the request of the Agency, copies of the brochure were sent to over 4,000 primary and secondary schools around the country as well as to regional Health Promotion Officers for general distribution.  Copies were also sent to manufacturers and retailers of window blinds.  This leaflet is available on the NCA's website: www.nca.ie.  The Agency is currently updating this brochure and expects to publish it later in 2011.  In addition, the Agency has been advocating for further revision, at EU level, to the relevant standard to eliminate the risk associated with window blinds.  It has also been urging Irish manufacturers, suppliers and retailers to address the issue.In relation to window blinds, a new European standard has been in place since February 2009 which has been adopted as ‘Irish standard I.S. EN13120 — Internal blinds — Performance requirements including safety".  As well as specifying the requirement for the fitting of internal blinds, this standard deals with the construction, transport, installation, operation and maintenance of window blinds.Work commenced in 2010 to revise the European Standard EN 13120 in order to strengthen requirements in relation to risks of strangulation by young children.  Ireland has actively participated in the working group responsible for this revision.  More recently work has taken place to draw up a parallel support-standard relating specifically to the testing of such products.  Both the revised standard EN 13120 and the new support-standard are expected to be published in 2012.In order to take account of national concerns in this area it is proposed that a national standard, more comprehensive than the European standard, will be published late in 2011 on providing guidance for manufacturers and installers as well as consumers on safe window blind products.  This standard will include other important guidance such as installation of corded window products and information on installation, including safety aspects, as well as training requirements for installers, manufacturers and sales representatives.  To this end a committee has been established by the NSAI comprised of representatives of the manufacturing and installation sectors as well as the NCA.  A draft standard will be available for public consultation in the forthcoming weeks.

All applications are processed strictly in date of receipt order by permit type and in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.  This particular Green Card application was refused on 6 July 2011 on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:highly skilled, highly paid positions or;non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;where there is an officially recognised scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.Furthermore, from the information submitted with the application, it appeared that the proposed employee was currently resident in the State without immigration permission and an employment permit could not be considered in this case.  In addition, the Green Card Scheme is designed for high level, strategic skill shortage occupations in certain economic sectors and the position on offer does not appear to fall within this Scheme.  The applicant was notified of this decision in writing and of their right to appeal within 21 days from the date of the refusal decision.  To-date no such appeal has been received in the Employment Permits Section.I wish to advise the Deputy that all appeals must be submitted by the applicant in writing addressed to the Appeals Officer in the Employment Permits Section of my Department and address all of the reasons for the refusal of the application.  If the applicant wishes to submit an appeal within this timeframe, the Appeals Officer will then review the decision made.

The approximate total capacity of the servers is 80 terabytes.  The ICT Unit in my Department have informed me that they are in the early planning stage for the formulation of a server consolidation and virtualization strategy.  Server specifications for servers owned by the agencies under the aegis of this Department are day-to-day operational matters for the agencies involved and not ones in which I have any function.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21312	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	769	Appointments to the boards of bodies accountable to my Department are made in accordance with the legislation under which the body was established.  The relevant legislative provisions vary from body to body.  For example, in certain cases the legislation provides for the appointment of persons nominated by specified stakeholders, such as professional or representative bodies.  This can sometimes have a limiting effect on the scope to address gender imbalances. In other cases there may be no such provisions.Appointments are also made based on the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.  Achieving greater gender balance on State boards remains a key objective as part of the overall goal of getting the best people serving on our State boards.To this end, I recently launched a public campaign inviting expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced persons for appointment to the boards of several agencies coming under the aegis of my Department.  The purpose of the campaign was to broaden the pool of suitable candidates for consideration for appointment to boards.  I also made it clear that in considering applications I would have due regard to Government policy on gender balance on State boards.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21312	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	771	The Taskforce referred to was established in 1998 in response to significant job losses in the County and the taskforce report ‘ An Action Plan to Establish Donegal as a Prime, Competitive and Attractive Location for Job Creation’   was produced in December 1998.  In  March 2000, the Donegal County Development Board (CDB) was established as part of the national programme for local government reform.  Given the overall remit of the Donegal CDB to co-ordinate public service delivery and development at local level, it was widely accepted that the newly established CDB was the most appropriate vehicle through which to implement the recommendations of the Report.On this basis An Stráiteis, Donegal CDB's 10 year strategy for the social cultural and economic development of the county incorporated the recommendations of the Taskforce Report. Progress reports on the work of the Donegal CDB are available on their website www.donegalcdb.ie.  The backdrop to the establishment of the Interdepartmental Group by the Government, was the continuing concerns about job losses in Co. Donegal following the closure of industries such as Fruit of the Loom and Hospira.The purpose in establishing the Interdepartmental Group was to secure agreement on a list of projects and actions, requiring priority implementation, that would increase the attractiveness of Donegal as a location for enterprise development.  The focus of the Group was to identify the various local issues representing barriers to the establishment and operation of enterprises, to take stock of relevant projects and actions already planned or underway, and, finally to identify measures that could be taken by the relevant Departments and agencies to support the environment for enterprise development and to quantify the resources required.  The primary focus of the Group was on actions requiring decisions at national rather than local level.On 27 July 2006, the then Minister published the Report of the Interdepartmental Group on Donegal.  The report identified the various infrastructure developments required to support enterprise development in the County.  The report found that the County was facing significant challenges in many sectors, with obvious challenges in Traditional Manufacturing, an above average Unemployment Rate and a need to enhance the education and skills of the workforce.  However, the report noted, not just that much progress had been made, but also that there were financial provisions available to complete major infrastructure projects, especially new roads, to equip Donegal further as an attractive location for enterprise development.Since then, the State development agencies supporting enterprise development have worked together in Co. Donegal to provide a clear vision and focus for future economic development.  Donegal became a targeted location for IDA with the County competing for a different type of business to the labour intensive manufacturing which Ireland so successfully won over the past four decades.  To encourage overseas investment IDA developed a Business Park in Letterkenny with modern building solutions capable of competing with other locations nationally and also internationally.  IDA also worked with the 3rd Level Sector in the region at Letterkenny Institute of Technology and the 3rd Level sector in Northern Ireland to offer the necessary courses aimed at target sectors.

Trustees and providers are required to obtain written confirmation to that effect from the trustees, administrators of the overseas arrangements to which the transfer is to be made.The trustees of a pension scheme are required to provide full details of the rights and options available to a person on leaving the employment including the option to preserve pension benefits in the scheme or have a person's accrued pension rights transferred.  A person can apply for a transfer payment within two years of termination of employment or longer if the scheme allows but before the preserved benefit becomes payable.  Arrangements to make the transfer payment must be made by the scheme within three months of the application being received.  Once the appropriate transfer payment is made, the trustees are discharged from any further obligation to provide benefits relating to the member's preserved benefit.

To date, the JobBridge website is hosting over 1100 opportunities across a wide range of sectors.  Some 110 interns have been selected by host organisations to commence an internship, of which 46 have been verified by my Department and, of these, 23 have commenced their internship.  I have requested a report to be compiled on the opportunities advertised by sector and by geographic location and will forward this report to the Deputy as soon as it is available.The national internship scheme is a key part of the Government's jobs initiative.  It will provide up to 5,000 unemployed people with an internship opportunity ranging from 6 to 9 months in an organisation in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors.  During this time participants will receive an allowance, which will consist of a €50 per week top up on their existing social welfare entitlements.   The scheme will run for 2 years so applications will be accepted until June 2013.Question No. 330 withdrawn.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	780	My Department will spend over €530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit over 630,000 people.  Difficult decisions have had to be made in light of commitments made by the previous Government.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to reconsider the changes to the fuel allowance and household benefits package which were announced last week.Under the Department's supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity.  In addition, exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.From September 2011 the fuel allowance is to be standardised at €20 per week, the rate currently received by the majority of customers who receive no additional allowance for living in a smokeless area.  The cost of the telephone allowance will be reduced following negotiations with Eircom which will ensure that customers receive €26.86 of value on their bills, at a cost to the State of €22.22 per month.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance will be reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  These three measures will generate savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.While of course we want to protect the basic social welfare payments which have very positive economic and social effects, regrettably there is an ongoing necessity to achieve savings due to our commitments with the IMF/EU/ECB troika.  There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home. The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce their consumption of energy through improving the thermal efficiency of the home.  Sustainable Energy Ireland has administered an energy efficiency programme for privately owned low income households (Warmer Homes) since 2001. Over 65,000 such households have benefited to date, with a further 15,000 expected to receive energy efficiency upgrades this year. A similar upgrade programme is also in place for local authority houses.

The couple in question came to Ireland on 1 June 2011 and applied for SPNC while residing with their daughter.  The couple subsequently returned to their home country shortly thereafter.As the couple were in the State for a very short period, their applications were disallowed as the residency condition for receipt of SPNC was not satisfied.  On the basis of information provided to my Department by the couple, it would appear that the couple's main centre of interest is outside Ireland and therefore, the habitual residence condition is also not satisfied.

In that context, there is no discrepancy.The Department of Social Protection is responsible for maintaining the national database of Personal Public Service (PPS) numbers which are stored on the Department's Central Records System (CRS).  There are currently 7.4 million customer records on CRS each of which is identified by a unique PPS number.  The PPS number in its current format was originally a tax reference number.  With the introduction of Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) in 1979 an individual's Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax reference number became known as a Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number.  The RSI number was re-named the Personal Public Service (PPS) number in 1998 to reflect its future use as a unique identifier across the wider public service.CRS is a complete database of all the historical tax reference numbers which were used to pre-populate the database in 1979 and every PPS number which has been issued since then.  In addition to those persons currently resident in the State who have been issued with a PPS Number, the figure of 7.4 million also includes any individual who, since 1979, required a PPS number and;1) has died,2) has been resident in the State and has subsequently left the jurisdiction, and3) has not been resident in the State (e.g. an individual resident abroad who has benefited from an Irish Estate —  the Revenue Commissioners have a requirement that all beneficiaries of Irish Estates should have a PPS number)The Department is continuously monitoring customer records on its CRS in order to preserve and enhance the quality of the data including, where appropriate, consolidating duplicate PPS numbers as they emerge.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	800	The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings. Extending State retirement age will also encourage and support those who have private or occupational pensions to remain longer in the workforce. This will improve overall pension sustainability and reduce costs for the employer. People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future and people  will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.Therefore, as provided for in recent legislation, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of the State pension age at 66 and will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.These legislative changes also fulfil one of the requirements set out under the EU/IMF/ECB Memorandum of Understanding.The National Pensions Framework, published in March 2010 sets out future pension reforms which aim to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.   It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and includes proposals for an auto enrolment scheme to provide access to private pensions.The Framework also recognises that many people want to have the option to work longer and proposes, for those who wish to postpone drawing down their State pension, to put in place arrangements to enable them to receive an actuarially increased benefit.   In addition, for those with contribution shortfalls at pension age, arrangements will be put in place to allow them to receive additional benefits if they continue to make paid contributions for pensions purposes while remaining in work or self- employment.The details and timeframes for these changes are set out in the National Pensions Framework, which was published on 3 March 2010.   An implementation group chaired by my Department is developing the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.

In considering previous applications the Department has advised the organisation that in view of the range of activities carried out by the centre it should be appropriate for the centre to seek to secure future funding from more appropriate revenue sources in the public and private sectors.In 2011, funding of some €350,000 has been allocated to the law centre.

Of these, 507 (55%) were deemed to satisfy the qualifying criteria, with 413 (45%) not satisfying the criteria.Autism Spectrum Disorder is treated in the same manner as any other disability or condition under the scheme.  Qualification for the scheme is not based on the disability of the child but on the level of additional care required.  In order to qualify for domiciliary care allowance, a child must have a disability so severe that it requires him/her to need care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age and must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.

There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie . Some 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation.Responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) transferred to the Citizens Information Board (CIB) in 2009 to provide strong management support to the local voluntary MABS companies.  As part of the ongoing review of its services the Board have put a new organisational structure in place, since April 2011, which enables CIB regional managers to get a greater insight into the nature of supports required by MABS companies on the ground to deliver an effective service.The CIB recently submitted a position paper setting out options for the future shape of MABS taking into consideration commitments in the Programme for Government and recommendations contained in the final reports of the Law Reform Commission on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, and the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This paper is currently under consideration.In addition, The Citizens Information Board and the Department are also engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality concerning their plans for reform of personal insolvency law, and the role of MABS, in the context of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.I am satisfied that MABS will continue to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.

For this year, the majority of back to school clothing and footwear allowance entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers. Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete an application form that is available for download from www.welfare.ie or by texting “Form BTSCFA”, followed by their name and address to 51909.Processing has begun on the manual applications already received and it will take 4-6 weeks to process applications. In all cases a letter will issue to applicants informing them of the decision and, where payment has been awarded, when and where they can collect the payment. In the case of refusal of the allowance the procedures for review of the decision will be outlined to customers.Due to the large volume of applications received, information regarding the receipt or progress of individual applications will not be available until such time as the applications have been examined and a decision taken.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	815	Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). However, not all tenancies are required to be registered with the PRTB as the relevant legislation, the Residential Tenancies Act, provides for certain exceptions.Where registration is required, the landlord has up to one month after the commencement of the tenancy to register it with the PRTB at the standard fee and longer to register at a higher fee. It is therefore not practical for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered before rent supplement can be paid to the tenant as the establishment of the tenancy will be dependent on rent supplement being awarded.The Department works closely with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to help ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards. The Department advises the PRTB of all new rent supplemented tenancies to assist them in implementing tenancy regulations and co-operates in any initiatives taken by the PRTB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act.Over the years the Department has been working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that landlords who benefit from monies paid out under the rent supplement scheme comply with their obligations under the Taxes Acts.  Section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 provides that from 1st January 2011, rent supplement should not be payable in respect of a tenancy where the landlord:i. has not provided the HSE with a Tax Reference  Number in a prescribed form, orii. has not advised the HSE in a prescribed form that she/he has no Tax Reference Number and has not notified the HSE the reasons why she/he has no Tax Reference NumberThe Taxes Acts place an obligation on the Department to provide the Revenue Commissioners with payment details relating to rent supplement on an annual basis. Section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 will help ensure that those benefiting from the rent supplement scheme are tax compliant.

However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards. In consultation with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DOEHLG), S.I. No. 572 of 2006 and Section 25 of Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced the condition that allows the Health Service Executive (HSE) to decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding the non-compliance with standards.  W  here such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant it is recommended that the HSE would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant. It is envisaged that new rent supplement claims in respect of properties that have been notified as being below standard, will not, in general, attract a rent supplement payment.

His claim was referred to one of the department's medical assessors who was of the opinion that the person was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer accepted this opinion and his claim was refused and the person was notified in writing of this decision on 15 November 2010.  The person subsequently appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Based on the evidence before him the appeals officer found that the person concerned was not substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment by reason of a specified disability within the meaning of Social Welfare legislation and the appeal was not allowed. The applicant was notified of this decision in writing by the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 8 July 2011.  An appeal officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence.  No application has been received to date for an invalidity pension from the person concerned and an application will now be sent to him.

As part of the process of establishing and developing this new service, the Department has commenced a major and comprehensive programme of change management entailing the integration of services previously, or currently, provided by other agencies — including both the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of FÁS and the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the HSE.With regard to the timeline for the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service the assignment and integration of functions and the full transformation to a case management approach focussed on activation, will be a multi-annual programme of work.  However, significant progress has already been made and many aspects of the new service will be delivered within the coming twelve months.The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has already been transferred to the Department of Social Protection with the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year.  The intention is to have the staff fully transferred into the Department by the end of September this year.  This will enable the Department to integrate the payment of all benefits into one organisation simplifying customer processes.Planning for the transfer and integration of the Employment Services and Community Employment Services of FÁS to the Department has already commenced and it is envisaged that the transfer of staff will commence later this year.  Again this will enable the Department to simplify and integrate the delivery of employment support services to customers.  Even in advance of integration, FÁS and the Department are already working on a number of pilot projects in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.   These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their rollout nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.As part of such an approach, FÁS and the Department have worked closely together on the development the National Internship Scheme which was launched by the Taoiseach on the 30 June this year.  It is expected that this scheme will provide 5,000 internships of up to nine months duration and participants will retain their social welfare entitlements and will receive a ‘top-up' of €50 per week. The scheme, which will be the first public manifestation of the National Employment and Entitlements Service, is already receiving strong support from the business community and potential participants.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	821	There are three State Boards for which the Minister for Social Protection has responsibility — the Citizens Information Board, Pensions Board and the Social Welfare Tribunal.  In addition, while the Pensions Ombudsman comes within the remit of the Minister for Social Protection, this statutory body does not have a board.  When filling vacancies to these State Boards every effort is made to comply with the requirement to have at least 40% of each gender represented on the Board.  In this regard, the relevant legislative provisions governing the membership of the Citizens Information Board require that not less than 6 of the 15 members must be female, while not less than 6 must be male.  50% of the current Board members are female, with one vacancy due to be filled.While members of both the Pensions Board and the Social Welfare Tribunal are appointed by the Minister for Social Protection, there is also a requirement that the members appointed must be representative of various interests involved.  For instance, appointments to the Pensions Board are subject to the conditions set out in Section 9 and the First Schedule of the Pensions Act 1990.  These conditions specify that all members of the Board are appointed by the Minister for Social Protection under the provisions of the Act and must comprise representatives of trade unions, employers, consumer interests, pensioner interests, the Government, the pensions industry, member trustees and professional groups involved with pension arrangements.  The term of office for Board members is five years.  Within this selection process due regard has been paid to date to ensure that the gender quota of 40% female representation on the Pensions Board is met.The Social Welfare Tribunal deals with cases where entitlement to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute and where claimants feel that they have been unreasonably deprived of employment because their employer has refused or failed to follow the negotiating machinery available for settling disputes.  The Tribunal comprises a chairperson and four ordinary members who must be representative of employees and employers.  Accordingly, two of the members are nominated by ICTU and the other two members are nominated by IBEC.  When seeking nominations for the ordinary members of the Tribunal from both ICTU and IBEC every effort is made to ensure that the nominations adhere to the Government's gender balance policy.  The current Tribunal, which was appointed in October 2009 for a 3 year term, has one female member (20%).Given the nature of the work of the Tribunal, appointments to the position of chairperson have, in the past, been made on the recommendation of suitable candidates by the Labour Relations Commission.  In the future it is intended that the position of chairperson will be advertised publicly and the most qualified and suitable candidate will be selected by competitive interview.

Comhairle, which was established on 12 June 2000 under the provisions of the Comhairle Act 2000, replaced the former National Social Services Board.  Under the provisions of the Citizens Information Act 2007, the title of this agency was changed from Comhairle to the Citizens Information Board on 21 February 2007.  The Family Support Agency was established on 6 May 2003 under the provisions of the Family Support Agency Act 2001.  Responsibility for this Agency has now transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman was established on 2 September, 2003 under the provisions of Part XI of the Pensions Act 1990 (inserted by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002).The number of staff employed by my Department in 1997 was 4,267.  The number of staff employed in January 2011 was 5,032 — this figure includes 160 temporary staff.  The requirement for an increase in the number of staff employed is mainly due to the increased number of people on the live register, as a result of the downturn in the economy.

Supports available include the back to education programmes and back to work schemes.  In addition, a fully integrated nationwide range of services and supports is available to employers and jobseekers through FÁS Employment Services, responsibility for which has been transferred to this Department.The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore and access, under professional guidance, a full range of employment and training services.  Development of the NEAP is central to ongoing development in the labour market policy area and will be progressed within the framework of a new National Employment and Entitlements Service which, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is being established by the Department.  The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services, currently delivered by FÁS and the Department, respectively,  within the Department and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers.In line with good international practice, this new service will focus primarily on activation. The objective is to encourage and enable customers to embark on developmental pathways appropriate to their needs; pathways to employment and /or training and/or personal development.  The objective of the new service is to offer users a high level, personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  A key feature of the new service will be that customers will be expected to engage with these options in order to retain their entitlement to full benefit payments.A number of pilot projects are ongoing in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.   These pilot projects will evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their rollout nationwide as part of the national employment and entitlements service.These developments are complimented by measures announced recently by the Government under the Jobs Initiative and include initiatives such as JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, which will provide 5,000 internship opportunities of 6 or 9 months in organisations in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. Participants will retain their social welfare entitlement s and will also receive a ‘top-up' of €50 per week.  In addition, from July 2, the rate of employers PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week has been halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013.All of the measures outlined will support people who are unemployed in acquiring the education and skills and work experience that will assist them in returning to employment while measures such as the PRSI reduction will encourage employers to new employment.

This may be done at the time of the preparation of the development plan or, where appropriate, at any other time. The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities. I am advised that Dublin City Council, to date, has not included the Inchicore railway yards in the Record of Protected Structures for Dublin City.  The Act also enables me, as Minister, to make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion of specific structures in its Record of Protected Structures and a planning authority must have regard to any such recommendations.  These recommendations are based on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) surveys conducted by my Department. The aim of NIAH surveys is generally to include structures which are of international, national and regional importance.The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage for Dublin City has yet to be undertaken. The advertisement inviting tenders to undertake the first NIAH survey of Dublin City is due to be published by my Department in the coming days.  This initial survey will focus on Dublin 1 and it marks the beginning of by far the largest NIAH county survey to date.

The Council has met on several occasions and recently made significant progress in regard to agreeing a work programme to address the needs of turf-cutters, while recognising the necessity to stop turf-cutting on Ireland's raised bog SACs.In April, I also announced a long-term compensation package for turf-cutters in sites where turf cutting is no longer possible.  The scheme, which applies to turf-cutters on all raised bog SACs, will deliver payments of €1,000 per annum, index linked, for a maximum of 15 years. As an alternative to financial payments, and where feasible, qualifying turf-cutters will be facilitated in relocating to alternative, non-designated sites to continue cutting turf.  Alternative forms of compensation are being actively explored by the Peatlands Council and I expect that these will be presented to me as solid proposals in the near future.My officials are in direct discussion with a number of groups of turf-cutters on various bogs with a view to agreeing sites for re-location and the terms and conditions of such relocation.  At the request of the Peatlands Council, including members representing turf-cutting interests, my officials are currently making themselves available at information clinics where interested parties can discuss their compensation and relocation options. Such clinics have been held in Roscommon, Offaly, Galway and Kildare. Further clinics will be arranged over the coming weeks.  The Government remains committed to reaching a fair and equitable outcome for those who cannot now continue turf-cutting in these sites.

The number of individual monuments on these sites would be greater since some contain more than one monument.  Generally monument sites owned by the Minister are publicly accessible with 69 having visitor services provided by the Office of Public Works. Some monuments acquired in the past do not have a public right of way. It is, however, my Department's policy to acquire rights of way to such sites, where possible, with the agreement of landowners and this practice will continue.  In the region of a further 120,000 monuments are protected under the National Monuments Acts.  Although most are located on private lands, public access is available in many cases under local arrangements.  There are also 6 publicly accessible national parks and 78 nature reserves managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.

The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities.  Inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.Section 59 of the 2000 Act provides for a planning authority to serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of protected structures.  On the basis of information submitted by the planning authorities to my Department, there were 19 such notices served in 2008, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2010.  I have given approval for my Department to undertake a review of the operation of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This review will focus on possible minor legislative amendments and a possible up-date to regulations where appropriate.Archaeological and natural heritage sites are subject to particular legal frameworks to ensure their protection.  They are also subject to monitoring undertaken by my Department.  This monitoring helps to ensure that risks for and threats to these sites are detected and addressed as early as possible thus avoiding endangerment.

I can confirm to the Deputy that a new logo has not been procured for the newly reconfigured Department, which is continuing to use the standard harp logo.  In addition, when ordering new stocks of stationery, the practice has been adopted of simply replacing the former name of the Department with its new name.  I have directed that all stationery currently held by my Department be used to the greatest extent feasible and have instructed my officials to ensure that any costs arising due to the name change of my Department are kept to a minimum.  In relation to replacing signage on Departmental premises due to the change of name, my Department is in the process of amending such signage and, once this process has been completed, it will be possible to quantify costs arising.

As part of the Jobs Initiative, a further €30 million has been provided for this year which underpinned the launch of the Better Energy Programme in May.  Better Energy    replaces three energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes: the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES), the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) and the Greener Homes Scheme (GHS).The obligations strand of Better Energy brings energy suppliers on board as partners, in fulfilment of Ireland's obligations under the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive.  These companies have been asked to finalise voluntary agreements with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which will deliver 200GWh of energy saving measures in 2011.  Energy companies can meet their target by directly offering upgrade services, or by subcontracting the work to third parties.Better Energy: Homes — allows domestic customers to apply for an Exchequer supported incentive, currently a direct grant which will be replaced by an up-front discount later in the year.  The measures grant-aided under this strand include roof and wall insulation, high efficiency boilers, heating control upgrades and solar thermal.  Energy upgrades were provided to 45,990 homes in 2010 and to 27,653 homes to the end of June 2011.Better Energy: Warmer Homes — provides energy efficiency improvements free of charge to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of community based organisations (CBOs) and a panel of private contractors.  Energy upgrades were provided to 24,291 homes in 2010 and to 8,556 homes to the end of June 2011.The amounts spent on the HES scheme are as follows:Programme2008 (Pilot)20092010Home Energy Saving scheme (HES) Total Capital Spend (€m)1.2514.92645.434The HES scheme is now fully integrated into Better Energy: Homes.

RTÉ is also responsible for the coverage and operation of its Saorview TV network.  Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, sets out RTÉ's powers and responsibilities in this regard.  Therefore, I have no direct function in the matter raised by the Deputy.RTÉ has established a dedicated website, www.saorview.ie, and a telephone helpline to assist the public to access Saorview.  This website also provides, inter alia, information on coverage of Saorview.The coverage checker on this website allows users to input their address.

Exploration drilling is specifically excluded under these authorisations.The Licensing Options are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data from previous petroleum exploration activity.  Both areas have been subject to petroleum exploration and drilling since the early 1960s and while some natural gas potential was identified, it was not considered commercially viable at that time.Exploration activity under these authorisations is at an early stage and there is no certainty that it will lead to applications for follow-on exploration licences that would be required before exploration wells could be drilled.  In the event hydraulic fracturing was proposed as part of a possible future exploration or production programme, then that activity would be subject to an environmental impact assessment, including an appropriate public consultation phase.

Better Energy replaces three energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes: the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES), the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) and the Greener Homes Scheme (GHS).Contractors can register with Better Energy: Homes if they wish to deliver any of the services supported under this scheme.  The registration process, from receipt of fully compliant documentation, is typically two days.  All registering contractors must provide the following documents:Completed and signed registration formCopy of Tax clearance certificate (TCC) or C2Contractor Certificate of Insurance form — completed by Insurance broker.The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has streamlined registration in order to minimise the additional documentation that is required from contractors previously registered for HES or GHS.  There are currently 2885 registered contractors actively operating under Better Energy: Homes.Competency requirements vary depending on the type of installations works the contractor is registered to carry out.  These requirements are detailed in the Code of Practice, Standards and Specifications document and in the contractor registration form, which are all available on the Better Energy section of the SEAI website.Since the launch of the HES scheme in March 2009, a total of 124,563 homes have made applications and accepted grant offers, of which 90,313 had successfully drawn down their grant by end of June 2011.The number and location of homes which have made application for a grant since the launch of HES in March 2009 and since the launch of Better Energy in May 2011 are as follows:County2009 HES Programme Launch to date (inclusive)2011 Better Energy Programme Launch to dateCarlow1,30686Cavan2,762159Clare6,938406Cork15,7171,424Donegal4,515263Co Dublin5,097336Dublin 1301109Dublin 1014313Dublin 1163544Dublin 1283162Dublin 1369654Dublin 1496178Dublin 151,11087Dublin 1699786Dublin 1717520Dublin 1860335Dublin 25616Dublin 2019217Dublin 2235224Dublin 2468380Dublin 363450Dublin 452133Dublin 51,08276Dublin 648133Dublin 6W58458Dublin 769449Dublin 837325Dublin 994964Galway10,607682Kerry7,192477Kildare3,308233Kilkenny2,954186Laois1,889129Leitrim79145Limerick8,879688Longford1,22859Louth3,235180Mayo3,948316Meath3,485236Monaghan2,470180Offaly1,53180Roscommon2,191138Sligo1,74098Tipperary5,683413Waterford4,648373Westmeath2,026114Wexford5,165295Wicklow2,205179Grand Total124,5638,888

Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.In terms of giving a direction to the Commission for Energy for Regulation (CER) in relation to the wholesale and retail pricing of this gas the Deputy should note that under section 23 of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act of 2002, the CER is responsible for regulating charges in the natural gas market, including supply tariffs to final customers.The Government has no power to dictate wholesale commodity prices.The CER regulates the Residential tariffs for Bord Gáis Energy.  There are three other suppliers in the residential market offering tariffs and customers are free to switch between these to get the best deal.All business sectors are deregulated and open to competition.  On this basis, and to maintain the integrity of the market and the regulatory process, it would be wholly inappropriate for me to issue a direction regarding retail pricing of gas.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	867	I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity and gas prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Prices in the electricity retail market are now fully deregulated.  Price setting by electricity suppliers, including Bord Gáis, is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned and I have no function in the matter.The CER was established in 1999, to regulate the electricity market.  All generators, transmission operators and suppliers wishing to participate in the Irish electricity market are required to apply to CER for a licence to operate.  Once an operator has received a licence, it is allowed to commence operations in the Irish market, subject to strict adherence to the licence terms and conditions which are established and monitored by CER.ESB prices for domestic electricity customers were regulated until 4th April 2011.  The welcome emergence of new entrants in the electricity supply market (business and/or domestic) started in emerge in recent years and their prices were effectively unregulated in comparison with ESB tariffs.  The Irish electricity supply market is now fully open to competition for business and latterly the domestic sector.  While the CER no longer regulates tariffs in the electricity market, it continues to have a role in monitoring market developments and ensuring that all suppliers comply with requirements designed to protect the interests of customers.

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Prices in the electricity retail market are now fully deregulated.  Price setting by electricity suppliers, including Bord Gáis, is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.The CER was established in 1999 to regulate the electricity sector in Ireland.  In 2002 its remit was extended to cover the natural gas market.  The CER is independent of all operators in the market and acts in the best interest of energy customers in Ireland by working to ensure that consumers benefit from a competitive regulatory framework  in energy markets.There have been sustained increases in global fossil fuel prices in recent months and this is putting pressure on all energy suppliers' margins.  Ireland has a high dependency on imported fossil fuels, particularly gas which coupled with geographic isolation and population dispersal means that Ireland is price taker in the international gas market.The CER has implemented a series of decisions over recent years designed to enhance and protect the rights of consumers and ensuring that operators in the market comply with their obligations to consumers.  As part of its standard decision making processes, the CER holds consultations with all interested parties in advance of making any decisions on consumer issues.  An example of a recent policy change in a consumer protection area was policy on disconnections.  In late 2010, the CER decided to temporarily reduce the cost of disconnection for electricity and gas and decided to divide the cost of disconnection equally between the supplier and customer.  This was done in response to the large number of disconnections taking place and to encourage suppliers to engage with customer and consider alternative options to disconnection.Also, in response to the increase in the accumulation of debt from various suppliers, the CER recently announced in June 2011, after consultation with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, the introduction of a debt flagging facility.  This alerts supply companies when customers wishing to switch supplier already have outstanding electricity bills above a certain level.  These flags are as follows: for domestic electricity and gas customers, when they owe more than €250 for over 42 days, and for small business when they owe more than €750 for over 42 days.Statutory Instrument 450/2010 on Market Monitoring for Electricity and Gas markets was signed in October 2010.  The Statutory Instrument includes consumer protection provisions in market monitoring that have given the CER additional powers and functions in this area as required by the EU Internal Energy Market Directives.  The EU Directive also contains provisions requiring Member States to enhance consumer protection provisions and provisions for vulnerable customers.  At present my Department is currently drafting the requisite Statutory Instrument to give legal effect to the consumer and vulnerable customers provisions in the relevant Directive, although, in practice many of the functions are already currently undertaken by the CER.

Following regulatory intervention by ComReg in this market, commitments have been obtained from the main Irish mobile network operators to reduce their MTRs such that maximum Irish MTRs would be approximate to the European average — details of these commitments are publicly available in Information Notice 10/82  published on ComReg's website.Building on previous decreases, the latest reductions in MTRs took effect from 1 July, with the blended average MTRs reducing by approximately 17% on the rates which applied in the previous six months.  These latest reductions, with further planned reductions every six months through to the end of 2012, will continue to ensure that Irish average MTRs are in line with the European average.I understand that a further review by ComReg of the wholesale mobile voice call termination market is currently under way and ComReg plans to consult on its preliminary findings later this year, including the imposition of an appropriate wholesale price control (to be in effect from 2013) and other regulatory obligations.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	870	The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV Licence Fee in light of existing and projected convergence of broadcasting technologies and to transform the TV licence into a household based Public Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device they use to access content.This commitment does not foresee the replacement of the current television licence system with a content licence system applicable to either all or certain classes of appliances.  The household based charge, if introduced, would in fact serve to remove the link between the fee and the appliance being used to access the content.In line with this commitment, my Department is currently undertaking an exercise whereby it is examining both the effectiveness and efficiency of the current model of television licence fee collection, in the context of the changing technological environment, and examining the efficiency of various international models for the funding of public service broadcasting.  The results of the exercise will be an analysis of the most effective models in terms of efficiency, capability to fund our public service broadcasting service and equity of applicability.  The scope of work being carried out under this review is quite extensive.  Nevertheless, I expect to receive recommendations arising out of this review by year end and, following that, work will begin on developing any necessary legislative proposals that might be required to facilitate the implementation of any recommendations that I decide to take forward.In terms of revenue distribution, the Deputy may also be aware that the Programme for Government commits to reviewing the funding of public and independent broadcasters to ensure a healthy broadcasting environment in Ireland.The broadcasting sector in general has faced a challenging funding environment in recent years with a large fall in commercial advertising revenues.  It is understandable in such a situation that extending further the scope of public service funding would seem attractive to some.  However, great care should be taken in considering any such course of action.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.  Therefore, in reviewing the funding issues, we must ensure that the ability of our public service broadcasters to deliver on their remits and obligations is not undermined through decisions that cause an erosion of their revenue base.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I wish to advise the Deputy that no direct funding has been provided to the Irish Business and Employers Confederation by my Department in any year since its formation in June 2007.  The issue of any funding provided by bodies under the aegis of my Department, is a matter for the individual bodies in question and I have no responsibility in this regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	872	My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, T.D. recently announced the terms of a Government Decision for the introduction of pay ceilings for higher posts across the public service and for CEO posts in Commercial State Companies.In addition, the Government signalled its intention to seek voluntary waivers of 15% of salary from current incumbents whose salaries are in excess of these figures or a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would bring their salary level below the thresholds.I can confirm that there are currently 3 CEO posts in Commercial semi-State companies under my remit where salary levels exceed €250,000.  These are ESB, An Post and Bord Gáis Éireann.I have recently written to the chairs of the above bodies on the issue of a voluntary pay adjustment from the incumbent CEOs of these bodies and I await a response.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	873	I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.  Price setting by Bord Gáis, ESB Electric Ireland and Airtricity in the electricity market is a commercial matter for the companies.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.In line with the CER's code of practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine financial hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer such as MABS or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter or budget controller (for electricity) if this is possible.Over the past three years the CER has been working with the gas industry to make prepayment meters (PPM) more accessible for customers who need them.  To assist customers though their financial difficulties, a full prepayment metering solution has been rolled out.  The gas market systems are established so that eventually all domestic suppliers can provide prepayment metering, with the intention that all Prepayment customers would be able to change supplier seamlessly if they so wished.Currently Bord Gáis Energy (which has 525,000 out of the 621,000 residential customers) is the only supplier providing Pre Payment Meters.  However, Flogas and Airtricity, which also supply the residential market, have committed to the CER to putting internal systems in place to underpin Pre Payment Meters services.The CER has been working with electricity suppliers over the past number of years on the provision of prepayment meters or budget controllers (an older technology) to customers.  Budget controllers are in themselves not meters but a budget management device that is installed in addition to the customer's meter.  To date, only ESB Electric Ireland has installed budget controller units for customers.  However, PrePayPower.ie is currently offering prepayment meters directly to customers.The CER is currently developing with industry a more modern prepayment ‘keypad' solution to budget controllers, which will be available to customers of all suppliers in financial hardship.  It will be similar to the Keypad meter currently offered in Northern Ireland.  The first 20k of these Keypad meters will become available from this winter, with 100k planned to be available by the end of 2012.  They will be made available only to those in financial hardship and in those cases the cost of the meter and its installation will be free of charge.

The revised telecoms package transposed by my Department in July 2011 obliges Member States to promote and encourage the provision of specific numbers in the 116 number range and ensure that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of such services.  It also requires Member States not only to reserve the 116000 number but also to make every effort that a service for reporting missing children is actually available in their jurisdictions.The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range is managed in Ireland by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The role of ComReg is limited to the assignment of the number to an appropriate service provider.  ComReg has alerted potential service providers, through an advertisement campaign, to the existence of the range of numbers beginning with 116, including the 116000 hotline for missing children.  Suitable applicants have been invited to apply for the setting up of services of social value under the specified numbers.  I am advised by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.  Once the number has been assigned, it is a matter for the service provider to provide the service.  Neither ComReg nor my Department has any function in providing such services or the remit to require any organisation to provide the service.While I have the responsibility for the transposition of the relevant EU Directives, the policy function in relation to the provision of a service for reporting missing children falls elsewhere.  In an effort to make progress on the provision of this service in Ireland, my Department has had discussions with both the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which have policy functions in the area of missing children and child protection.  I have also written to both Ministers on this issue.I understand that the Department for Children and Youth Affairs has had discussions with prospective service providers, including NGOs and hopes to be in a position to progress this matter in conjunction with Department of Justice and Equality.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	878	I have no proposals at present to introduce the legislative measures referred to by the Deputy.  The unauthorised access of personal information is, in the first instance, a matter for An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which has responsibility for the protection of personal information.I understand that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is having discussions with some of the mobile phone operators in relation to this matter with a view to addressing potential problems with the existing voicemail access system.Consumers can ensure greater security by ensuring that the default access code for voicemail is changed and by deleting messages in their voice mailboxes.  I also understand that many new Smart Phone devices have built in privacy managers which allow the user to customise how the phone manages personal information, and that these settings can be changed at any time and not just when an application is first installed.  The use of PIN numbers for access to handsets and voicemail and in some instances encryption of messages allow users to protect information stored on their phones, such as SMS messages and emails, as well as enabling them to protect personal information, such as voicemails, stored on the telecommunications network.I recently introduced secondary legislation which obliges undertakings providing publicly available electronic communications networks or services to safeguard the security of its services and, indeed, it is an offence for such undertakings not to comply with these requirements.  Provisions in relation to data breaches have also been strengthened.  Responsibility for the enforcement of these measures rests with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	885	In September, 2006, my Department launched the programme Action on Private Rented Accommodation Standards.  Arising out of this programme, on 1 February, 2009, new regulations prescribing minimum standards for rented housing, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008) came into effect, with certain provisions being phased in for existing rental properties over a four year period.A number of further measures, including a strengthened sanctions regime, required primary legislation and this was delivered by means of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 made minor amendments to the 2008 Regulations for compatibility with the 2009 Act and completed the new regulatory code.Article 2 of the Regulations sets out the date from which the Regulations take effect.  This depends on whether or not the house is an existing rental property and in such circumstances Articles 6, 7 and 8 will apply from 1 February, 2013.  The purpose of Article 6 of the regulations is to ensure that each rental property has exclusive access to its own sanitary facilities and that those facilities are contained within the habitable area of the house.  This provision will have the effect of removing traditional bed-sit-type accommodation from the rental market.  Articles 7 and 8 relate to effective heating and to sole access to adequate facilities for hygienic storage, preparation and cooking of food.All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.To ensure that all local authority housing stock meets the necessary standards required under the Regulations, my Department established a €10 million fund in 2010 to support local authorities, where required, in upgrading their stock.  Over the course of 2010, authorities expended €6.7 million on upgrades with a further €0.56 million expended in 2011.

Under EU law, National Allocation Plans approved by the European Commission are final and ex-post adjustments by Member States are not permissible.  Allowances to installations are underpinned by assigned amount units which Member States, as Parties listed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol, received free of charge.  Consequently, no cost was incurred by the Exchequer in giving operational effect to the National Allocation Plan 2008-12.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	888	I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 474 together.A person occupying a house under the shared ownership scheme has the right to buy out the local authority's share and acquire full ownership at any time.  Alternatively, this may be done by purchasing, from time to time, additional shares of the authority's equity.  For Shared Ownership transactions commenced from 1 January 2003, the cost of purchasing an additional share or the redemption value of the outstanding share is based on its initial cost adjusted annually to compensate for differences between the rent paid on the local authority's share and the interest calculated by reference to the prevailing variable interest rates.  The rent payments under the Shared Ownership Scheme are intended largely to meet the cost of funding provided by the Housing Finance Agency to local authorities to finance the rented share in the equity of the house.  For transactions commenced before 1 January 2003, the cost of purchasing an additional share, or the redemption value of the outstanding share, is its initial cost updated in line with the most recently published Consumer Price Index to the time of purchase.Accordingly, the scheme is structured on the basis that, on redemption, the price of the outstanding share is not determined on the basis of a percentage of current market value, but is, rather, a function primarily of its initial capital cost.While this may seem unfair to those living in shared ownership properties in the current market, it is important to note that the purchasers were in the position of having their share of the property rise in value when the market was rising.Mortgage interest supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Scheme, administered by the Department of Social Protection, is payable, subject to the qualifying conditions of that scheme, in respect of mortgages under shared ownership transactions, in the same way as in the case of mortgages generally.  An annual subsidy towards rent payments under the Shared Ownership Scheme is available through the Rental Subsidy Scheme, to households with a gross household income of up to €28,000 per annum in the preceding tax year. The level of subsidy ranges between €2,550 for incomes up to €13,000 and €1,050 for incomes up to €28,000.The Government's housing policy statement, published on 16 June, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, as part of the review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.Under the legislation the person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property on the date of the making of the rate by the relevant local authority.  The owner rather than the occupier may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate.  Should a person's occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year.  However, as a subsequent occupier, that person can be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.My Department continues to keep all matters relating to commercial rates under regular review.

These Regulations require that all bituminous coal placed on the market for residential use must have a sulfur content of no more than 0.7%.  This provision came into immediate effect and now applies throughout the State.The Regulations place the main provision of an existing Voluntary Agreement between my Department and the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers, on a statutory footing.  The Voluntary Agreement, which has been in place since 2002, has reduced noxious emissions to air which result from the use of bituminous coal in residential dwellings.  The Regulations consolidate the environmental and related human health benefits achieved by the Agreement.The Regulations were prepared following an extensive consultation process between my Department and key stakeholders, which included the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities and the SFTG.  This consultation process commenced in November 2009 and continued up to the time that the Regulations were signed into law.  My Department has ongoing contact with these stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of the Regulations.

The Commission must finish its work not later than 3 months after the final census figures are published.  Therefore, the Commission's report will be based on the Census Report setting out the final result of the Census in respect of the total population of the State.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reduce the number of members in Dáil Éireann.  The provisions set out in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011 respond to this commitment.  The terms of reference of a Constituency Commission as set out in the Bill require a Constituency Commission to recommend a set of constituencies based on a number of members of Dáil Éireann between 153 and 160.  However, the terms of reference are subordinate to the relevant constitutional provisions.  A Commission cannot recommend constituencies that do not meet the Constitutional requirements.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	897	The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure nationally, including County Cork.  Provision is made to commence contracts to the value of over €200 million in the county during the period of the programme.The programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic recovery.  A key input to the development of the programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Cork County Council in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised by my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.  Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.  Cork County Council submitted a proposal for the extension of the Innishannon Water Supply Scheme (Belgooley & Riverstick) but it was not possible to include the proposal amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the programme.Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, has recently been reviewed and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by water services authorities for addition to the programme.  No new proposal for the existing Innishannon Regional Water Supply Scheme was received from Cork County Council.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	898	I propose to take Questions Nos. 462 and 463 together.The EU LIFE+ Programme 2007-2013 is a dedicated EU funding instrument for the environment which complements existing EU funding arrangements.  It succeeds the EU LIFE programme under which Ireland received funding of €14.5 million in respect of 30 LIFE- Environment projects.LIFE+ has three components: LIFE+ Nature and Biodiversity, LIFE+ Environment Policy and Governance and LIFE+ Information and Communication.  Environment Awareness projects generally fit in the third strand of the Programme.In addition all projects funded by the Life+ Programme have to include a public awareness strategy.Projects must accord with national and EU priorities and have a clear EU added value.  The programme is open to public or private bodies, or institutions registered in the EU.The current phase of the programme runs from 2007-2013 and has a budget of just over €2 billion.  Ireland's allocation is approximately €4 million per annum.  The maximum co-financing available from the European Commission is 50% with exceptions for certain projects under the LIFE+ Nature component which may receive  up to 75% EU contribution when clearly targeting priority species or habitats.Projects are assessed by the Commission based on their published Guidelines which are available on my Department's website www.environ.ie and on the EU website http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/funding/lifeplus.htm.Under the current Life + Programme, the Commission publishes an annual call for applications.  Applications are routed through the National Focal Points which, in Ireland's case, is the Sustainable Development Unit of my Department.  The deadline for submission of proposals this year was 18 July 2011.The Local Agenda 21 Environment Partnership Fund is an annual grant scheme which has been run by my Department since 1997. Funded and administered jointly by my Department and local authorities, the aim of the scheme is to promote sustainable development by assisting small scale, non-profit environmental projects at local community level.  This year a fund of €395,000 is being allocated by my Department, with matching funding expected from the Local Authorities.  The encouragement of further private funding from individuals, groups or businesses is expected to achieve total funding for 2011 in excess of €1 million. 3,163 projects have been supported since the introduction of the scheme.  The 448 successful projects in 2010 ranged widely in scope, including from community gardens, allotments, compost schemes, rainwater harvesting systems, ecological educational initiatives, environmental exhibitions and recycling initiatives.There is no funding currently allocated under the EU Water Framework Directive for community based environmental education initiatives.

In the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department is working with local authorities in developing options for the enhancement of these arrangements which will further assist citizens in availing of local authority services and in reporting problems or faults to their local authority.  I have received proposals for the piloting of a publicly accessible web site with associated mobile technologies, designed to record non-emergency issues such as graffiti, road defects, street lighting and drainage.  I expect the pilot to go live shortly.

If the Board or a party mentioned in a Determination Order is satisfied that another party has failed to comply with one or more terms of that order the Board or the mentioned party may make an application to the Circuit Court in accordance with section 124 of the Act.  The Act also provides for the enforcement of tenancy registration requirements, specifically sections 144 and 145, which provide for the issuing of notices to landlords and/or occupiers of the dwellings in question and the prosecution of offenders for non-compliance with the registration requirement.The PRTB publishes statistics in relation to its enforcement actions in its Annual Reports which are available on its website www.prtb.ie.  The most recent Annual Report currently available is that for the year 2009.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	901	The obligations of landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector are set out in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which provides the main legislative framework for the sector and, in particular, for the operation of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the independent statutory body charged with the administration of the Act and the enforcement of those obligations.Breaches of landlords' obligations may be referred to the PRTB in the context of applications to it for its disputes resolution services.  The PRTB may then issue directions regarding those obligations in its Determination Orders and, in the event of non-compliance with the Orders, it may pursue enforcement via Court proceedings.My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB's key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  The outcomes of the review were announced by my predecessor as Minister of State and, in April 2010, the Government approved the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to deliver on the review's recommendations.I am at present evaluating those recommendations and associated legislative proposals and I intend to submit proposals in that regard to Government in the near future.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	902	The reply to Question No. 122 dated 6 July 2011 dealt comprehensively with the issues raised.  As indicated, Dublin City Council, as a property owner in Priory Hall, commissioned a building survey in conjunction with other property owners in the complex who agreed to participate in the survey on a fee-paying basis.  The report has recently been submitted to the Council and is currently being considered.  Copies of the report have also been forwarded to those owners who participated in the survey.  The question of further publication does not therefore arise.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	903	Data on housing needs have historically been compiled on a triennial basis by my Department.  However, with effect from the 2011 survey, the results of which will be published later this year, this exercise will be conducted on an annual basis.  At present, the most recent data available are from 2008 and these are available on our website www.environ.ie.  There is no differentiation between priority housing lists and housing lists in the aggregated data that my Department collects.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	904	A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities.  Data for the 2011 Assessment of Housing Need are currently being compiled by the Housing Agency and will be published as soon as possible.  The last assessment took place in 2008 and indicated that there were 1,394 homeless households on local authority waiting lists, of which 709 were in the Dublin region.  A breakdown of this figure by household on a local authority basis is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  
However, the Counted In survey, which is a special purpose count of people using homeless services carried out in Dublin every three years since 1999, has been generally considered to provide the most robust indicator as it surveyed the number of homeless persons in homeless hostels, shelters, sleeping rough, etc, over a particular week, irrespective of whether they have made application to the housing authority.The results of the last Counted In survey in 2008 reported a total of 1,436 homeless households in Dublin, compared with 1,361 in 2005.  A further 708 households were recorded as residing in long-term or transitional accommodation.  However, not all of these would be regarded as homeless, particularly where, for example, households were resident in suitable accommodation that would be likely to provide their most appropriate home in the long-term, or where they had begun to make a transition out of homelessness.The Pathway Accommodation & Support System (PASS) is an accommodation management and inter-agency service user support system which is being developed in accordance with priority actions of the implementation plan set out under national homeless strategy 2008-2013 The Way Home.  The system commenced in the Dublin Region in January 2011 and is currently in use by almost all service providers of homeless accommodation and outreach supports in the Dublin region. Work is still ongoing to ensure consistency of use and accurate information recording by the service providers, as well as the elimination of duplicate records, validation of data etc. The PASS system will provide good quality timely data on homelessness which is essential in ensuring an evidence base for all homeless services. I understand that validated data on the number of persons recorded as homeless on the PASS system in the Dublin region will be available in September 2011.

Both reports are available on my Department's website —www.environ.ie.The Committee will be meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months.  At the national level, I am encouraged by the strong consensus and commitment among the key stakeholders who are participating on the Committee and, at the local level, I understand that planning authorities are already making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bondholders in seeking to resolve urgent public safety works and in preparing site resolution plans for these housing developments.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	907	I introduced the Unfinished Housing Developments Safety Initiative earlier this year as a response to the issues identified in the report of the high level group set up to assess the issue. My primary concern was to make safe those estates which posed a safety risk to the public and where funds to remedy these issues could not be ordinarily accessed by means of completion bonds or pursuit of developers.An allocation of €5 million was made available by my Department and local authorities were invited to make applications for funding to alleviate the problems in those instances that qualified for the funds.To date 237 developments have been identified as qualifying for funding and submissions have been received in the case of 146 of these. The balance of submissions and associated claims are anticipated shortly. Allocations of €1.4 million have been approved by my Department in the case of 58 estates, as outlined in the following table. The remaining 88 applications are being evaluated and allocations will be issued shortly.The scheme was initiated as a health and safety initiative and was driven by the urgency of the situation. The local authorities are required to pursue recovery of funds expended from those developers and bond issuers who remain liable for the works.Local AuthorityAmt.

The making and amending of these rent schemes are an integral part of a housing authority's housing management functions, subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 of 6 March 2002.Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 will replace, once commenced, existing enactments in relation to differential rent schemes.  Regulations and guidelines for housing authorities to give effect to section 31 are currently in preparation in my Department.  While it is not the intention to introduce a national standardised differential rent scheme, regulations later this year will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme, including —the level, type and sources of household income that may be assessed for rent purposes;how dependents will be accounted for in calculating rent;the manner in which the size, standard, etc., of any class or classes of dwellings shall be taken into account in determining rent, having regard to the market rent in respect of dwellings of similar size, standard, etc., in the administrative area concerned;   andprocedures for rent reviews.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	910	My Department continues to work closely with Dublin City Council in progressing its regeneration programme for the former PPP projects at St. Michael's Estate, O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street, St. Theresa's Gardens, Croke Villas, and Dolphin House.  To support this programme, I have made an allocation of €7 million available to the Council this year to support the construction works at St. Michael's estate, demolition at St. Michael's Estate and O'Devaney Gardens, and for the relocation of households from these complexes to facilitate future regeneration.  Under the terms of the regeneration programme, the City Council is required to prepare a comprehensive master plan for each project that considers not just the physical improvements but also the social and economic regeneration of the areas.  This holistic approach is fundamental in building and supporting sustainable, stable communities and my Department continues to work closely with the City Council in this regard.In terms of the six individual projects, the following is the current position:Last autumn, my Department approved the City Council's first phase redevelopment at St Michael's Estate, with Exchequer funding of €5.8 million being provided for the social housing element.  This project is underway with the original housing substantially demolished and construction commenced;Outline proposals for O'Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street are currently going through the statutory planning process following which detailed designs will to be prepared and submitted for Departmental consideration;A preliminary report outlining possible options for the redevelopment of St Teresa's Gardens was received in my Department in March 2011 and is under consideration in the context of the overall regeneration programme;The City Council is undertaking a full survey of the Dolphin House complex which will be used to inform a programme of remedial improvements there.  Remedial works to the plinths have already commenced and the City Council are reviewing the results of a pilot project to address ventilation issues in six units completed recently;The City Council is continuing its programme of relocations from all of the complexes, although the level varies between complexes for local and other reasons.  These relocations are critical to facilitate the future regeneration of the areas.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	911	My Department provides funding for senior citizen housing projects through a number of capital funding mechanisms, including the Social Housing Investment Programme, Capital Assistance Scheme and the Improvement Works Programme, the allocations for which are provided to Dublin City Council on a annual basis. There is no specific allocation for senior citizen projects within the overall capital allocations programme.A number of projects, completed, ongoing and proposed, would include senior citizen units as part of a larger overall scheme, and these units may not be readily identifiable to my Department, as the allocation of units is a matter for the local authority concerned.Based on the local authority's annual allocations it is a matter for housing authorities to finalise their plans for the composition, management and delivery of their programmes, taking into account existing commitments, identifying priority projects and proposals, and providing a time line for delivery and a sustainable funding plan for each project and their programme as a whole.Social housing allocations by local authority for the period 2007-2010 are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie   under Publications/Statistics and Regular Publications/Housing Statistics. In addition to €50 million allocated to the Ballymun Regeneration Scheme, my Department has allocated a further €50 million to Dublin City Council for the provision of social and voluntary units and improvement works in 2011.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	914	I propose to take Questions Nos. 480 and 481 together.I understand that the Questions refer to the actions taken by Dublin City Council in meeting their obligations under the Derelict Sites Act 1990.The Derelict Sites Act 1990 provides that local authorities are required to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. I expect local authorities to use their statutory powers as they consider appropriate.Section 19 of the Derelict Sites Act provides for compensation with respect to the compulsory acquisition of derelict sites.  The compensation paid is an amount equal to the value (if any) of the site. In default of agreement on the amount of compensation to be paid, the matter will be subject to arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919.The operation of derelict sites legislation is currently under examination by my Department in the context of the Unfinished Housing Estates Report.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	915	The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 applies to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions which are set out in section 3(2) of the Act. Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under an arrangement or agreement which is not a tenancy or under a tenancy to which the Act does not apply, the PRTB does not have any function in the registration of such agreements or arrangements.The PRTB can adjudicate as to whether a rental agreement is a tenancy or a licence and has done so in the past. Where it finds that a tenancy is unregistered due to the landlord's claim of licence, the PRTB can serve a notice requiring registration and failure to comply is an offence.  I am unchanged in my view that all tenancies that should be registered with the PRTB must so be and I am supportive of the PRTB's enforcement activity in this regard.The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992  sets out minimum standards for private rental accommodation.  These regulations apply to all houses which are let, or available for letting, for rent or other valuable consideration solely as a dwelling with the exception of certain categories of accommodation set out under Article 4 of the Regulations.  These categories include houses let to a person for the purpose of occupying the house for a holiday and houses let by the Health Service Executive or by an approved body, where sanitary, cooking or dining facilities are provided for communal use within the building which contains the house.

My Department routinely reviews the gender balance of State boards under its auspices and returns are made to the Department of Justice and Equality which has a coordinating role in this regard.  The most recent returns by my Department show that at the end of 2010, the gender balance on State boards under the aegis of my Department stood at 37 per cent female and 63 per cent male.  My Department is currently seeking expressions of interest for appointments to a number of State boards, and due regard will be had to Government policy on gender balance in making these appointments.

My Department is continuing to work with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to seek a solution. I am not in a position to make any decisions at this time. Any funding decision would fall to be made in the context of the overall budgetary situation later in the year.The detailed information sought in respect of applications is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	925	In view of the fact that the Domestic Violence Act 1996 provides a legal framework within which the victims of domestic violence can seek a range of remedies in the courts to suit particular circumstances, I have no proposals to extend the statutory powers of housing authorities in relation to anti-social behaviour in local authority housing to cover cases of domestic violence.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	929	The information requested, in relation to an extended period of time, is not readily available in my Department and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work. If the Deputy wishes to put down a more specific Question in the area of consultancies, or to communicate separately with me, I will endeavour to provide the information sought.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	930	A new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing was introduced in every housing authority on 1 April 2011. The new assessment system includes a requirement that applicants only need to apply to one housing authority to be placed on up to three waiting lists, provides for the use of a standard application form and sets maximum net income limits based on the cost of housing in the area in question. The ultimate aim of the new system is to create a fairer, more consistent and transparent approach to eligibility for social housing support.  The criteria for determining housing need are set out in the regulations and are broadly similar to what was provided for in earlier legislation.As was the case under the old system, housing authorities may review the eligibility for local authority housing of households on the waiting list at any time and are required to review eligibility prior to the allocation of accommodation.  In this connection, my Department has advised authorities that, where household income is fluctuating over time, it may be advisable to take this into account when undertaking an assessment review and not necessarily take a household off the waiting list unless there is reason to believe that the personal circumstances of the applicant have so changed that it is unlikely that they will qualify for social housing support at the allocation stage i.e. they are consistently over the income threshold.I will keep all aspects the new assessment system under review to ensure that it functions in the intended manner. Since the Regulations were originally made, I have already made an amendment to increase the maximum income thresholds originally set by €5,000 in each band, with the intention of broadening the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, in order better to promote sustainable communities.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	931	My Department issued approval to Dublin City Council in September 2009 for the acquisition of 112 social units and associated ancillary facilities, including community and day care facilities at Spencer Dock, in the sum of €34.5 million. It is understood that a number of legal issues have arisen in connection with the planning of the development.  Until these are resolved it is not possible to comment on how the project will be advanced.With regard to Castleforbes Road, my Department granted approval of a loan of €4.7 million to Dublin City Council under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) for the provision of 21 units of accommodation. The Council subsequently informed my Department that the developer had entered into receivership, and that it is not possible to say when the issues surrounding this may be resolved. CLSS is currently being wound down and any claims for such schemes must be submitted and drawn down before the end of 2011.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	934	I can inform the Deputy that the Dublin City Coroner's Office does not record referrals on a district or area basis and that the collation of such information would require a disproportionate use of available resources.I can however advise the Deputy that the number of deaths reported to the City Coroner for each of the years 2006 to 2010 was as follows: 2006 — 2,417; 2007 — 2,646; 2008 — 2,753; 2009 — 2,910; and 2010 — 2,801.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	935	I can inform the Deputy that my Department has been in contact with the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland with regard to the application by the college referred to by the Deputy, a private US establishment, to be included on the Internationalisation Register (a list of approved courses for non-EEA students). I understand from those discussions that the college is not eligible for inclusion on the Internationalisation Register as it does not provide full time programmes in Ireland, of at least one year's duration leading to awards which are validated or accredited by national awarding bodies from other countries which have a status in law or are otherwise recognised as having authority to make awards which have national recognition in their host jurisdiction. The courses offered by the college are not accredited by any US educational authorities.Notwithstanding the above, the Student Review Unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service is considering the application of in question and will be in contact with the college in due course.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	936	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 376 of Tuesday 17 May, 2011 in relation to this person. The situation remains unchanged since that response.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	937	I understand the Deputy's question to refer to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 which entered into force on 23 July 2009. The primary purpose of this Act is to provide for additional measures with respect to the combating of organised crime.I am informed by the Garda authorities that since the enactment of the legislation until 30 June this year, the provisions have been used on 127 occasions where arrests have been made relating to organised crime. To date, eight individuals have been charged under the legislation, six under Section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 6 of the 2009 Act (participating or contributing to certain activities) and two under Section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 5 of the 2009 Act (directing the activities of a criminal organisation).
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	938	I can advise the Deputy that issues in relation to the management of sex offenders in the community were considered in detail in two documents published by my Department. Both documents — The Management of Sex Offenders (January, 2009) and Summary of views received on the Management of Sex Offenders (October, 2010) — are available on the Department's website at www.justice.ie.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	939	I should make the point at the outset that the Report is necessarily brief, as we were limited to a maximum of 10,700 words, or approximately 20 pages.  The wide range of issues arising therefore are perforce covered in a concise style. The prohibition in our laws against discrimination on a range of grounds — including on gender, civil status and family status grounds — is referenced in a number of sections in the Report. It is important to make the point that men are protected by these three grounds (which are the specific grounds most relevant to the matters raised in the Deputy's question).  As indicated in the case reports referred to by the Deputy, the existing body of legislation is sufficiently robust to deal with discrimination against either men and women on these grounds.In relation to family law issues, I would draw the Deputy's attention to paragraphs 93 and 94 of the Report. The commitment contained therein is a specific response to issues raised by groups representing men in the public consultation process and in submissions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	940	I can inform the Deputy that my Department did not receive any funding from the National Lottery during the years in question.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	941	I would draw the Deputy's attention to my responses on 29 June last to his Questions (No. 175 and No. 176) on this matter.The small claims procedure of the District Court is an alternative method of dealing with a civil proceeding in respect of a small claim.  The majority of claims are dealt with by administrative staff in the local District Court offices. Typical claims are:a claim in respect of goods or services purchased from somebody selling them in the course of a businessminor damage to property (excluding personal injuries), andthe non-return of a rent deposit for certain types of dwellings.Since 5 January 2010 the procedure has been expanded to allow for business to business claims of the same nature.  The current maximum value of cases that can be taken is €2,000.  This limit was set in 2006 and was last reviewed in 2009 in advance of the expansion of the scheme to cater for business to business claims of the same nature which came into effect on 5 January 2010.  I am informed that the review found that the existing limit was appropriate and should remain unchanged as an increase risked a negative impact on the level of service provided by Small Claims Registrars throughout the country.  The procedure is labour intensive but  provides a satisfactory service at present.  In addition, new European Small Claims Procedures, provided for under Regulation (EC) No. 861/2007, were introduced in 2009. These procedures also provided for a maximum claim limit of €2,000.I am not in a position to comment on any particular case but the Deputy will note the procedure does not cover claims in respect of debts, personal injuries or breaches of leases or higher purchase agreements. Generally such cases may be more effectively and speedily dealt with by way of civil bill.  As the Deputy has previously been informed, the scope and operation of the procedure is being reviewed by my Department.

The Deputy can be assured that following this assessment I will make the report's findings and any proposals which I may have known in due course.I can inform the Deputy that my Department, in compiling the report, has been in close contact with the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána with a view to monitoring the position. I can inform the Deputy that the Commissioner has reported that all "Cash for Gold" premises in the State have been visited by An Garda Síochána and the operators of such premises have been made aware of their responsibilities and obligations with regard to purchasing gold and jewellery.  In addition, I have been informed that contact information has been provided to "Cash for Gold" operators by An Garda Síochána which will facilitate the reporting of any suspicious activity.  The Commissioner has also indicated that any new "Cash for Gold" premises that may be identified will be visited by An Garda Síochána.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	943	The management and administration of the courts, as the Deputy will be aware, is a matter for the Courts Service.  The allocation of the business of the courts, scheduling of court cases and the management of court lists are matters for the judiciary and the Presidents of the courts.  The sittings and vacations of the courts are currently provided for in Rules of Court. The Presidents of the respective courts can, and do so on occasion, schedule additional sittings to address particular issues.I have already in the context of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 provided for a range of measures to make the courts more efficient.  I intend to review other matters, including vacations and sittings, with a view to promoting further reform.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	944	In its report to the Minister for Social Protection, published last week, the Gender Recognition Advisory Group concluded that the existing equality legislation and investigative machinery are adequate to discourage and prevent discrimination against persons who are making the transition from one gender to the other — both during and after the transition phase.As already announced, my colleague the Minister for Social Protection will be bringing forward legislation to provide for amendment of registrations of births for transgender people.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	945	I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person concerned applied for a temporary travel document on three occasions, twice in September 2009 and once in March 2010 and was refused on each occasion. He was advised to contact his own consular authorities to renew his passport or obtain an equivalent document. There is no current application from the personconcerned.I should point out that a temporary travel document is normally only granted in exceptional circumstances, for example, to go abroad for urgent medical treatment or other humanitarian reasons, and where the applicant is not in a position to obtain a passport or other equivalent document from his or her own authorities.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	946	The Deputy will appreciate that a Referendum will be necessary to establish a Court of Appeal.  And while it is not one of the three Referendums proposed to be held later this year it is my intention to finalise examination of the detail and to progress the matter at the earliest suitable opportunity.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	947	My Department has commenced consideration of the measures necessary to establish a Commercial Court at Circuit Court level in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  This is a complex issue and detailed consideration will be necessary.  It is, however, my intention to progress the matter as soon as possible.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	948	Under our law as it stands sections 77 and 78 of the Succession Act 1965 deal with the requirements for a valid will.  A will need not be in any special form but it must comply with the provisions of those sections.  There is no legal requirement for a will to be drawn up by a solicitor but in practice, given the importance of the matter, many persons making a will consult a solicitor.While no representations have been made to my Department to suggest that operation of the law in this area is unsatisfactory my Department will, of course, continue to review its operation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	949	Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.  These provisions relate to behaviour which is anti-social as defined in section 113 of the Act.In setting up the regime in the Act, the intention was that the different interventions would address the problem behaviour.  If they succeeded, there would be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  It is only if they failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question that a court order would be applied for.I am informed by the Garda authorities that three court orders were issued to adults in 2008 and one in 2010 and three orders were issued to children in 2008.I am awaiting a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the other information requested, and I will contact the Deputy again when the information is to hand.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	950	Legislation currently in place relating to anti-social behaviour, including the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides inter alia for behaviour warnings and criminal proceedings in respect of anti-social behaviour, applies to private residences as well as public places and is utilised as necessary by An Garda Síochána.Such legislation is kept under ongoing review by my Department.I am informed that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is considering the approach to anti-noise legislation in light of the Programme for Government, which includes a commitment to address noise pollution.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	951	The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court having considered all the circumstances of the case to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.There are a small number of situations, however, where statute has created important exceptions to this approach.  There is a strictly mandatory sentencing requirement for murder and other provisions relating to drug trafficking and firearms offences where a presumptive mandatory minimum sentence applies.  Where the court is satisfied that there are exceptional and specific circumstances which would make a particular minimum sentence unjust, a different sentence can be applied. The type of circumstances which a court may consider would include whether and when the accused pleaded guilty and whether they assisted the investigation of the offence.The Deputy will appreciate that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing as they are in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  It is important to make the point, when discussing sentencing, that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence he regards as unduly lenient.The Deputy may be aware that my Department is currently engaged in a public consultation process to develop a White Paper on Crime with a view to developing a policy framework for future strategies to combat and prevent crime.  Part of the consultation process focussed on criminal sanctions, during the course of which sentencing guidelines were discussed.  There was no consensus on how such guidelines might operate without undermining judicial independence and flexibility. The prevailing view, with which I agree, is that judicial independence is crucially important and should be safeguarded. However, I should add that the Law Reform Commission has been asked to consider, and if appropriate, recommend reforms in the law in relation to mandatory sentencing. The Commission will consider the use of mandatory sentences for offences in general terms along with approaches based on "ranges of sentences".  I welcome the fact that the Commission intends to publish a consultation paper on this subject later this year.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	952	The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service facilitated a major study of prisoner re-offending by the UCD Institute of Criminology, the findings of which were published in the May 2008 edition of the academic journal, Criminology & Criminal Justice.  The recidivism rate was found by this study to be under 50% after 4 years which is in the mid to lower range of recidivism rates when compared to similar countries internationally.  The study did not, however, explore the impact of time spent in open centres on recidivism rates.
The Irish Prison Service keeps records of periods in custody for every prisoner which allow calculation of re-imprisonment rates by type of offence, including sex offences.  However, these do not allow calculation of a comprehensive rate of re-offending that includes non-custodial sentences.  I am pleased to say however that the Probation Service is in the process of conducting initial research into re-convictions and much work is being done to collate the relevant data which will add to our knowledge in this area.As regards employment placements for released prisoners, I can assure the Deputy that programmes such as those funded through the Business in the Community Ireland (BITC) Gate service and PACE will have my full support in maximising any opportunities available.  While we have to make the best use of available resources, I am confident that every effort will continue to be made in the years ahead to facilitate opportunities for employment and of course to assist where possible the re-integration of prisoners into their communities.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	953	The commitment referred to by the Deputy is being examined in the context of the development in my Department of proposals for the Family Law Bill that is referred to in the Government Legislation Programme announced on 5 April 2011. The details will be announced by way of publication of the proposals as soon as possible, taking into account necessary consultations.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	954	I wish to inform the Deputy that the information requested is not readily available. Given the period of time concerned and amount of detail sought the information requested could only be compiled by the use of a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort.However, to be of assistance I can inform the Deputy that in the period since I took up office, that is from 9 March 2011 to date, one payment has been made by my Department to the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC). The Equality Authority made a grant in the amount of €15,000 for the Integrated Workplace Project, which was paid on 20 July, 2011.I also wish to refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 389 of 17 May, 2011 and, in particular, the following extract from my reply.While the National Disability Authority (NDA) was a member of IBEC, membership was terminated with effect from 2010. The following amounts were paid by the NDA to IBEC for the years 2007 — 2009:January 2007  — €1,505.93January 2008  — €1,719.00January 2009  — €1,642.60
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	955	Legislative proposals to enhance the protection of children against sexual abuse and exploitation, including exploitation through prostitution and child pornography, are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  These measures will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of international legal instruments, including outstanding requirements in the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.I expect to bring these legislative proposals to Government in the coming months.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	956	The National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Human Beings in Ireland 2009 to 2012 was published in June 2009.  The Plan contains a commitment to a mid term review involving a consultation process with relevant stakeholders.  This process is underway in my Department.  Submissions were received from a number of non-governmental organisations in May, June and July.  Consultations with State agencies will now take place on foot of the issues raised in these submissions.The Plan will then be updated in the light of that consultation and to take account of changing circumstances and our growing experience in this area. It is hoped to complete the review in the coming months.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	957	I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that the number of persons in custody on 1 July 2011 was 4,402.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	958	It may be helpful to explain that the only court that would record a conviction in a summary trial is the District Court, where there is no jury.  The Special Criminal Court operates without a jury but its jurisdiction is not restricted to summary offences.Unfortunately, it is not feasible to identify the exact number of persons in prison on a specific date on a conviction recorded in a summary trial.  However, from the information available, I can say that on 30 June 2011, there were 568 sentenced persons in prison with a sentence of 12 month or less and 3,167 sentenced persons with a sentence of more than 12 months.  The majority of those persons who received a sentence of less than 12 months will have been convicted in the District Court (although a proportion of those receiving a sentence of less than 12 months will have been convicted in a jury trial in the Circuit Court).  It is unlikely that anyone serving a sentence of more than 12 months will have been convicted in a summary trial.I can further inform the Deputy that the number of defendants who received a sentence of imprisonment/detention in the District Court in 2010 is 12,979.  The number of offences was 20,435 and this figure includes summary offences and indictable offences dealt with summarily.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	959	Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from An Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	960	The management and administration of the courts including responsibility for maintaining court statistics is a matter for the Courts Service.However, I have had enquiries made and the Service has informed me that 498, 672 criminal offences were disposed of in the District Court in 2010.  Of those, 70,200 were indictable offences that were dealt with summarily.The outcomes in relation to the cases are available in the Courts Service Annual Report 2010 at www.courts.ie. The Courts Service has informed me that the various outcomes recorded do not differentiate between summary cases and indictable cases dealt with summarily.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	961	The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation around the country is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), who have responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the OPW is currently examining options for the provision of a new Garda District Headquarters at Bailieboro. This matter will be progressed in the context of An Garda Síochána's identified accommodation priorities and in the light of available resources.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	962	The extent to which my Department provides supports to failed asylum seekers or other illegal immigrants returning to their country of origin depends largely on whether or not such persons are willing to leave the State voluntarily.Where a failed asylum seeker or illegal immigrant decides to return voluntarily to their country of origin before a Deportation Order is made in respect of them, reintegration assistance may be provided by my Department. The Irish  Voluntary Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration Programme (VARRP), run in conjunction with the International Organisation of Migration (IOM), has been established to provide assistance to failed asylum seekers and irregular migrants wishing to return voluntarily and who have been identified as vulnerable. Under the VARRP scheme, which is funded by my Department, the IOM will pay for the flights home for such persons and where required will assist   in securing travel documents and give assistance at the airport at departure and arrival.Persons planning to return voluntarily under this programme can apply for reintegration assistance before they depart which they can then access once they have returned to their home country. Irish reintegration assistance is in the form of a payment in kind, for example help starting up a small business, or to revive an existing one, vocational training classes or educational courses.The value of this reintegration assistance for single individuals is up to €600 and for families up to €1000.Where a failed asylum seeker or illegal immigrant consents to deportation to their country of origin, flight arrangements are made on their behalf and are paid for by my Department. If they are not in possession of a valid passport and are unable to obtain same (for example, due to their country not having an Embassy in Ireland), the Department will   then issue a travel document. If the person is residing outside the Dublin area my Department will, if necessary, arrange accommodation to facilitate easy access to the airport, and provide travel vouchers for their journey to Dublin.Where a failed asylum seeker or illegal immigrant does not leave the State voluntarily or consent to their deportation, they are removed to their country of origin by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. No further support, other than that which is necessary to effect the deportation, is given to such persons.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	963	Valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation from the persons referred to by the Deputy were received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in August 2007 and my predecessor decided in his absolute discretion to refuse the applications. The persons concerned were informed of the Minister's decision in a letter issued on 15th October, 2009.It is open to the persons concerned to lodge a new application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at that time.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	964	There are currently around 2,100 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda Síochána.These staff provide vital support services in a wide range of areas, such as human resources, training & development, IT and telecommunications, finance and procurement, internal audit, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services.Every opportunity will be taken, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, to enhance the level of civilian support within the Garda Síochána, including through redeployment under the Croke Park Agreement.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	965	The Garda Síochána now operates a new model of Community Policing which aims to build upon and enhance progress made so far.  I fully support this renewed emphasis on Community Policing particularly in light of the priority given to this by the Programme for Government.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	966	The Deputy will appreciate that a significant amount of Garda time has to be devoted to court duties.  In that context specific measures have been put in place by the Garda authorities, and in legislation, to minimise the extent to which Garda members have to attend in court.  This is, of course, subject to the overall requirements of justice and judicial supervision.My position, and that of the Government, is that it is vital that Garda and other public service resources are utilised as effectively as possible.  With this in mind, I have initiated a review of the criminal justice system to identify any structural changes that might be required to achieve cost savings.  The review, which is being conducted in conjunction with key stakeholders, encompasses the participation of Garda members in court proceedings and I expect that it will be completed by October.  I will bring forward any proposals I may have arising from the review as quickly as possible.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	967	Information on the work of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs) is published annually in the Report of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme, in accordance with Section 44 of the Children Act 2001, as amended. The last published report, for 2009, is available on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service (www.iyjs.ie) and on the Garda website (www.garda.ie).Information is published by Garda Division and includes the number of incidents and the number of children referred to the Diversion Programme, along with the deployment  of JLOs across the Divisions. Using this information, it is possible to work out an approximate caseload per JLO. However, such an exercise would appear to be of no added value unless account is taken of the complexity of the individual cases. It is also the case that any more detailed analysis would, at this stage, involve a disproportionate use of Garda time and other resources.  I understand that the report for 2010 is nearing completion and I will publish it as soon as possible after I receive it.With regard to Government's plans to extend the role of JLOs, I wish to refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 13 July 2011.

This particular permission to remain does not extend to the person's dependants.Records in my Department indicate that the second and third reference numbers referred to in the details accompanying the Deputy's Question, relate to the named person's adult son and daughter.The named person's son contacted my officials through a solicitor in relation to his residence in the State and was instructed to contact his local immigration office to register with An Garda Síochána and obtain permission to remain in the State.  There is no record of him having done so to date.  This is in breach of the Immigration Act 2004 and various orders made thereunder. The named person's son has failed to register in the State since 22 November 2010 and consequently is illegally present here. He should immediately contact INIS in relation to his residence in the State.  The named person's daughter has permission to remain in the State on student conditions until 1 April 2012.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Her case was reviewed in June 2008 and again in November of 2009.  A detailed examination of the representations she submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) was conducted and on both occasions a decision was made to affirm the Deportation Order.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 July 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.An application for Subsidiary Protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	978	Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 as amended by Section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act of 20006 already provides that any person who assaults or threatens to assault a peace officer acting in the execution of his or her duty, knowing that he or she is, or being reckless as to whether he or she is, a peace officer so acting, shall be guilty of an offence. In this context, "Peace Officer" includes a member of An Garda Síochána as well as other emergency workers. Persons found guilty of offences under that act are liable on summary conviction to a Class A fine (not exceeding €5,000) and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both. The penalty on conviction on indictment is a fine determined by the Court or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 7 years, or both.The situation will be kept under review. I will listen carefully to any suggestions for further change and I will have no hesitation in bringing forward proposals for additional sanctions if the need arises.

The capacity of individual servers varies widely depending on the role and function of that server.  In general the servers behind the Shared Service would have a cumulative capacity of between 30 and 60 terabytes depending on configuration and deployment.In addition to the IT Shared Service two areas of my Department maintain a separate IT infrastructure.  Financial Shared Services in Killarney — which obtains its own desktop services from the Shared Service — operates a payroll and payments system using 32 servers with a capacity of 16 terabytes.  The Irish Prison Service has 175 servers with a cumulative capacity of 21 terabytes.My Department does not lease any IT equipment.The provision of IT services for the offices and agencies of my Department currently not availing of the IT Shared Service is a matter for management in those offices and agencies.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	999	This matter has its origins in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive which was first introduced in 1985 and is presently implemented in Irish legislation by the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001.The primary objective of the EIA Directive is to ensure that projects which are likely to have effects on the environment are subject to a prior assessment of their potential impacts before a decision is taken as to whether consent is granted to proceed.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a judgement against Ireland on the 20th November 2008. The Court found that Ireland, in relation to the specific projects the subject of the judgment, was overly reliant on size thresholds to determine if an EIA is required and did not take sufficient account of the nature, location and cumulative effect, etc. of projects. The action related to three categories of activities, restructuring of rural land holdings (removing hedgerows or re-contouring land), the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture and water management projects for agriculture, including irrigation and land drainage.There has been extensive consultation between my Department and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in the preparation of a response to this case. It was considered that most of these types of activities are more appropriate outside of the planning system, and that legislation should be introduced by my Department that would provide a more accessible and timely screening and consent process for farmers. Therefore, these elements have been removed from the planning system by exemption and will now be included in Regulations that I will introduce. The drainage or reclamation of wetlands (bogs, marshes, ponds etc.), however, given the environmentally sensitive nature of such lands, will be retained in the planning system while the drainage of other lands will be controlled under my Department's Regulations. It should be noted that it is not intended that the drainage of lands will be generally prohibited but that a farmer will have to apply for permission where he or she intends to undertake drainage works above a certain area threshold.The European Commission, on 1 June 2011, formally lodged an application with the ECJ to initiate second proceedings against Ireland for failing to implement the ECJ ruling.  The Commission is requesting the ECJ to impose lump-sum and daily penalty fines on Ireland until the infringement ends.The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government has brought draft regulations to the Oireachtas for approval. These Regulations amend the EIA and planning exempted development thresholds for drainage or reclamations of wetlands. A Joint Oireachtas Committee meeting of the Transport, Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht was held on Thursday 14 July 2011 to discuss the draft Regulations   and these regulations have now been referred back to the Dáil and Seanad for consideration on 20 July.Discussions on Ireland's response to the judgement between the European Commission and officials from both Departments are ongoing. It is my intention to introduce legislation as soon as they have satisfactorily concluded.

Its implementation, as well as the parallel negotiations at EU level to ensure an appropriate CAP policy and EU Budget framework post 2013, are the strategic steps which I am pursing to develop the agri-food sector.Actions have already been taken to progress implementation of Food Harvest 2020.   I chair the High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC) which has been established specifically to ensure a fully joined up effort on the part of State bodies in the implementation of FH2020; to encourage proactive engagement by the agri-food industry and private sector with the implementation process; and to act as a "clearing house" for issues relating to the development of the sector.Actions taken includeA call for research proposals targeted on the priorities identified in Food Harvest 2020.The establishment of the Agri Research Expert Advisory (AREA) Group to facilitate input from the agriculture industry into primary research programmes.A Dairy Expansion Activation Group, comprised largely of private sector representatives, has already   published its Dairy Sector Road Map, setting out the actions required by the sector to achieve the target 50% increase in milk production by 2020.The Beef 2020 Activation Group has reported back to the HLIC on its proposals to drive the implementation of the beef related recommendations of FH 2020.Bord Bia, Teagasc and the UK Carbon Trust are collaborating to verify and improve the sustainability aspect of Bord Bia's Beef Quality Assurance Scheme.The ‘Brand Ireland' concept is being developed initially through the work of Bord Bia.I am continuing to work to make substantial progress towards the achievement of the agri-food industry targets and next week I am producing the substantive progress report on what has been achieved over the past year under Food Harvest 2020.

It was requested in the detailed rules of the scheme that applicants should ensure they allow sufficient time for their application to reach the designated office before the closing date. While the tracking number referred to may provide evidence of postage before the closing date, it also provides evidence that the application in question was not received in the Department until 11 April. There was significant over-subscription to this scheme.It is regrettable that the incorrect notification letter issued to the named person; however, the fact remains that the application was not received by the closing date and, it was for this reason, rather than for the reason of educational qualifications, that the application was not submitted to the assessment group for consideration.Accordingly, I cannot accede to your request in this matter. I would of course point out that the applicant can apply in the event of a future scheme being launched in relation to new entrants.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1016	The reason for maintaining a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is to protect public health. A consultation process was held during 2008 to determine public views on the proposal to extend the ban to include goat and sheep milk. Seventeen responses were received. Neither my Department nor the Food Safety Authority of Ireland were convinced that the submissions received provided any justification to oppose the expert advice that the extended ban should be supported in legislation.The proposed ban is based on strong advice from both food safety and public health professionals. There have been serious health issues associated with the drinking of raw milk in Ireland and in a number of other countries. In 2010 the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland published a report on the prevention of E. coli infection. One of the recommendations of that report was that the sale of raw milk be prohibited. I am satisfied that a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is fully justified. I do not propose to ban the sale of cheese or other products manufactured from raw milk, as the same risk to public health does not arise. The FSAI is charged with assessing risks associated with other food products and my Department will consider any advice given by the relevant experts and appropriate action will be taken, if required, to deal with those risks.Legislation required to allow the sale of raw milk on a restricted basis would be complicated and would impose significant extra cost on my Department in relation to oversight and enforcement. Failure to adequately oversee such high-risk business operations could result in serious national and international reputational risk to our important dairy industry. The prevalence of TB in herds in Ireland puts us in a different position to most other Member States in the EU where the disease has been eradicated. It is inappropriate that Ireland should adopt the same approach to the consumption of raw milk as countries that do not have the same difficulty with TB and therefore have no associated risk.Article 10(8) of EU Regulation 853 of 2004 provides that a Member State may maintain or establish national rules prohibiting or restricting the sale of raw milk or raw cream intended for direct human consumption. The introduction of S.I. No. 910 of 2005 to implement the EU Food and Feed Hygiene Regulations in 2006 had the effect of removing the existing legal basis for the prohibition of the sale of raw cows milk for direct human consumption under S.I. No. 9 of 1996. Section 54 of the Health Act of 1947 (as amended by Section 25 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006) has been identified as the appropriate primary legislation for this purpose and the Department of Health has agreed to promote a Statutory Instrument under that Act on behalf of my Department. The latest indicative timeframe for the introduction of the S.I. is end 2011, which includes allowance for a 3-month EU notification period.

The Office of Public Works is responsible for the pier at An Blascaod Mór.My Department's Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme does, however, provide funding for Local Authority owned Piers and Harbours subject to the availability of necessary funding.  In May 2011, my Department invited Local Authorities to submit applications in respect of priority harbour development projects for inclusion in the 2011 Programme. The application from Kerry County Council did not include a request for funding for Dunquin.  The 2011 programme has been finalised and Local Authorities have recently been informed of the funding that has been allocated to them under the Programme.Any applications for funding in future years will be given consideration subject to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.

This unit provides services directly to adoptees, natural mothers and birth families.  It also works closely with the registered adoption societies and the HSE nationwide information and tracing services.  Improvements to this service have been effected by the computerisation of the unique adoption files held by the Board.The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  Already 440 matches have been made on the Register representing over 900 individuals who have now received a service.  The operation of the Register was reviewed in 2007 and a major upgrading of it has just been completed.The Adoption Board, together with the societies, the HSE and the support groups, developed the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service".  This was published in November 2007 and sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally. The standardised Framework is currently being piloted nationally. In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, the Adoption Board intends to undertake a consultation process with interested parties to determine how best to address the needs of those adopted from abroad.Legislation to provide for information and tracing is in preparation within my department and is a priority.  This is a sensitive and complex area, and it will be  necessary for the legislation to balance the constitutional rights of mothers whose children were adopted with those of adopted people seeking to trace their birth families.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1025	The Programme for Government 2011 states that the referendum on Children's Rights is a priority, and that the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the All Party Oireachtas Committee. On taking office I instructed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) to work with the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to preparing a draft wording which will more closely reflect the work of the Joint Committee, than that which the previous Government approved in draft form.Accordingly the preparation of a draft wording is being undertaken by Parliamentary Counsel in association with the Advisory Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and officials in my Department. I would hope to be in a position to submit the outcome of this work to Government for approval in the Autumn. It is envisaged that Government will be asked to approve the drafting of a bill based on the wording submitted and to request the approval of the Oireachtas for the holding of a Constitutional referendum. I look forward, in particular, to the debate among political and civic leaders and the wider public about the place of children within our society further raising awareness of the interests of children.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1027	I propose to take Questions Nos. 598 to 602, inclusive, together.I launched the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on 15 July, 2011. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.  It sets out a number of key messages relating to the duty to protect children.  Among these are that the safety and welfare of children is everyone's responsibility, that children will have safer lives where everyone is attentive to their well-being and that people who work with children across a range of areas understand their responsibility for safe practice and the reporting of concerns.  The Guidance sets out specific protocols for HSE social workers, Gardaí and other front line staff in dealing with suspected abuse.  The scope of Children First extends beyond the reporting of suspected abuse.  It emphasises the importance of multi-disciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of such concerns.  Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure better outcomes.I have advised my Cabinet colleagues that it is my intention to develop proposals in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality for a Bill to make compliance with the Children First Guidance a statutory obligation. The legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk and the objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by strengthening the existing system for reporting and responding to suspected child abuse.However the focus on compliance does not in anyway underestimate that we need capacity in our child protection services. We must also focus on appropriate management, consistency of response and the creation of a world-class Irish model of child protection.This week I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas the Second Progress Report on recommendations contained in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan. Putting Children First on a statutory footing was a key recommendation of the Ryan Report and went hand-in-hand with other recommendations including those focusing on resources such as the proposed recruitment of 270 additional social workers. These posts are exempt from the public service recruitment moratorium and I am happy to report that 260 of these additional social work posts will have been filled by the end of this year. These new posts will significantly strengthen the capacity of the state's child protection and family support services.I will present the necessary Regulatory Impact Analysis for consideration by the Government together with the Heads of Bill.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1028	The provision of an additional 270 social workers is one of the actions provided for in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan. The HSE completed the recruitment of 200 additional social workers in 2010. The HSE National Service Plan includes provision for the recruitment of an additional 60 social workers in 2011. It is the intention of the HSE to fill the remaining 10 posts in 2012.In addition to the recruitment of the additional staff, the HSE has also been filling social work vacancies which have arisen due to individuals leaving the service, e.g. due to retirements.The filling of social work vacancies and the recruitment of additional social workers was exempted from the current public sector recruitment moratorium. The need to recruit further additional social workers will be considered in the light of demand, availability of necessary resources and progress made in delivering necessary reforms in the area of child welfare and protection.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1029	The 2011 budget for the Youth Affairs Section of my Department is €60.154m on current expenditure and €800,000 on capital expenditure. This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities through grants in aid.Foróige is currently in receipt of €6.037m from Youth Affairs Unit for projects run under a number of schemes including the Youth Service Grant Scheme, Special Projects for Youth Scheme, four (4) Youth Information Centres and for a number of projects under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2).  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I am aware of the Big Brother Big Sister Programme. However, having regard to the reductions in public expenditure that must be achieved by Government Departments and State Agencies and the limited funding available, it was not possible to consider funding for the programme in 2011. In light of further budgetary constraints in 2012 it is unlikely that any new application for funding will be considered next year.

Of these bases, 30 have varying degrees of dependency on on-call duty after hours — where ambulance staff are available but not on the premises — rather than rostered duty, where staff are on site.  The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is working to reduce the dependency on on-call arrangements.The HSE National Service Plan 2011 provides for publication of HIQA response times data for the first six months of 2011, at the first quarterly reporting date of September 2011.  This information is being collected and must go through the HSE's testing and validation process prior to being available for publication.  Response time data is collated on a regional basis only and will not be available on a station by station basis.In order to achieve the HIQA targets, the NAS has developed a Performance Improvement Action Plan, focused on achieving an improvement in response time performance.  It is expected that the move from on-call to rostered after hours arrangements, where feasible, will be a significant factor in any such improvements.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1043	The HSE plan implementing the changes to the Emergency Department at Roscommon County Hospital came into effect on 11 July.  This saw the establishment of an Urgent Care Centre in place of the Emergency Department.  Persons with acute or life threatening conditions such as heart attacks are being brought by ambulance to larger hospitals, such as Galway, with higher volumes of patients and better outcomes for such conditions.The Urgent Care Centre operates from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week and is provided by non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) with clinical governance provided by an Emergency Medicine Consultant at Galway.  As part of the transitional arrangements for a four week period, an NCHD is also available at the Urgent Care Centre from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. supervised by an on call consultant.An enhanced ambulance service has been put in place.  During the day four ambulances staffed by paramedics are available while three are available at night.  In addition there is a special Rapid Response Vehicle, staffed by an Advanced Paramedic on a 24/7 basis.  An out of hours GP service is also in operation.  A Medical Assessment Unit is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.  This is a medical admission pathway and accepts referrals from a range of sources, including General Practitioners.  I was briefed on the plan by the HSE in advance of its implementation.  The plan was necessitated by the serious patient safety concerns of the HSE and of the Health Information and Quality Authority in relation to the emergency service at Roscommon following the publication of the Authority's report on Mallow.  This was compounded because of NCHD recruitment difficulties.Roscommon Hospital has a clear future, and will continue to provide key services to the people of the area.  I believe that smaller hospitals can and should provide as wide as possible a range of services, close to the local community.  The key concern is that they are safe.  I intend to prepare a framework for the development of smaller hospitals, which will set out how they will develop to reach their full true potential.  This will specify what services are transferring to them, from the larger hospitals.  Too often we have focused on what we are taking away rather than what we can add to services there.All of this will be done with full regard to the safety issues highlighted by HIQA, in its reports on Ennis and Mallow Hospitals.  When implemented, smaller hospitals will have vibrant role, doing more work — not less — and meeting as many as possible of the needs of their local community.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1048	I propose to take Questions Nos. 624 and 650 to 653, inclusive, together.The figures I cited on 5 July referred to 30-day in-hospital mortality rates from Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), otherwise known as heart attack, based on a three year period from 2008 to 2010. This is an indicator which has been developed by the OECD as part of its Health Care Quality Indicators (HCQI) project.  The data comes from a draft report which is currently being completed by the Chief Medical Officer's division within the Department.  This report assesses the potential value of using routinely collected hospital discharge data derived from the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) system as a means of examining selected issues on quality of care.  It is my intention to publish the report as soon as it has been finalised.The reason for the difference in the mortality rates which I referred to and those quoted in relation to cardiac patients is that they are not measuring the same cohorts of patients.  As indicated, the indicator on AMI in-hospital mortality is an internationally accepted OECD measure.  There is no comparable well-defined indicator of overall mortality from cardiac conditions.  Further, the ESRI, which administers the HIPE system, has not been engaged in producing hospital-based mortality rates for cardiac patients.As Minister for Health, I place great value on the use of high quality information in monitoring the performance of the health system and in informing decision-making.  The HIPE system is our best source of comprehensive, validated data on hospital patients.  It was originally designed to record type and volume of hospital activity, but it is increasingly important that HIPE be fully and appropriately utilised and enhanced to support robust quality measurement.  The forthcoming report will represent an important contribution to this objective.

However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Government's proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1058	It is recognised that smoking in cars exposes all the occupants to harmful environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).  ETS is a carcinogen and contains the same cancer-causing substances and toxic agents that are inhaled by the smoker.  There is no safe level of exposure to ETS.Exposure to cigarette smoke is particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces, such as cars, and parents and others with responsibility for the welfare of children have a particular responsibility to ensure that such exposure does not take place.While legislative measures have been introduced in a small number of countries in relation to smoking in cars with children the nature of the measures and of the accompanying compliance and enforcement arrangements have varied significantly.  In some jurisdictions smoking in cars is treated as a driving offence while in other jurisdictions it has taken the form of an education tool aimed at highlighting the dangers of smoking in cars.  Any proposal to introduce a ban on smoking in cars must, therefore, be evidence based, with data on the extent to which it occurs and the actual risks to public health.  Consideration will also need to be given as to the extent to which it may be appropriate to deal with the issue as a road safety and a public health issue.Before any new measures in this area are considered, it will, at the outset, be necessary to establish the extent of the problem.  Thereafter, the successful introduction of measures with regard to smoking in cars will benefit from the roll-out of a public information and education campaign to mobilise public support.A similar approach proved very successful in the introduction of the smoke free at work initiative and other tobacco control initiatives in the interim.  These provisions were underpinned by a clear evidence-base, good planning, the mobilisation of public opinion by way of a public education and information campaign, and simple, clear and enforceable legislation.Proposals relating to smoking in cars are being considered in the context of the Tobacco Policy Review currently underway in my Department and are expected to be completed and submitted to me within a matter of months.  I have already signalled that I am in favour of legislating in this area but would like to see a public information and education campaign to highlight the dangers associated with exposure to ETS in cars and to mobilise public support in advance of the introduction of legislation.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1061	The Deputy will be aware the Office of Tobacco Control was merged into the Health Service Executive (HSE) in December of last year.  All of the core functions of the Office including the maintenance of the tobacco retail register, advice to the Minister on control and regulation of tobacco products, consultation with national and international bodies in the field of smoking prevention, making recommendations to the Minister on measures to reduce or eliminate smoking, and supporting research to identify measures to reduce the incidence of smoking, and preparing and publishing research were retained and a National Office for Tobacco Control has been set up within the HSE.The HSE has no function in relation to illicit and counterfeit cigarettes which are primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  In this regard, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they continue to implement a wide-ranging programme of measures to combat illicit and counterfeit cigarettes including seizures of illegal products and prosecutions of offenders, monitoring of internet sites and importation routes, monitoring of sales patterns to identify and investigate irregularities and target enforcement activity, contributing to action taken at E.U. level to improve the controls of excisable products in the community, and monitoring of sea cargo on the basis of risk analysis-seizures.  In the period 2008 to 2010 the Irish Customs Service seized a total of 532 million cigarettes with an estimated retail value of €222 million representing just under 30,000 individual seizures.There is a range of measures under consideration by the Tobacco Policy Review Group (TPRG ) including price, enforcement of existing legislation and cessation services.  I anticipate that the report of the TPRG will be completed in the coming months and that this will be brought to Government for decision.

It seeks to substantially improve and standardise the care of acutely ill medical patients.  The programme has been jointly developed by the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, to enable the hospital structure to meet present day needs in appropriate settings, thereby providing optimal care for patients.The classification of individual hospitals will determine the type of treatment they may offer.  It will be based on a range of parameters, including the type and level of complexity of treatment that can be performed safely.  This in turn will be determined by factors such as volume of treatment carried out and the complementary specialties, back-up services and range of clinical skills available.  The programme will set out how hospitals operate. In particular it will allow smaller hospitals to increase activity in areas such as day surgery, minor injuries, outpatients, rehabilitation and diagnostics, which are growths area for health care both nationally and internationally.  I believe that smaller hospitals can and should provide as wide a possible range of services, close to the local community provided they are safe.  I intend to prepare a framework for the development of smaller hospitals, which will set out how they will develop to reach their full true potential.

When implemented, smaller hospitals will have a vibrant role, doing more work — not less — and meeting as many as possible of the needs of their local community.Significant re-organisation of acute hospital and related services has already taken place in the mid-west region since April 2009. A   single region-wide department of emergency medicine was set up with 24-hour Accident and Emergency services centralised in Limerick.Staffing of the ambulance services in Clare and North Tipperary were enhanced and an advanced 24-hour paramedic service is in operation. Ennis and Nenagh provide an urgent care/minor injuries service for 12 hours a day). Acute and complex surgery (including all cancer surgery) is carried out in Limerick Regional.  Day surgery is undertaken at Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's Hospitals. A regional department of Anaesthesia/Critical Care has been established and all critical care services are now provided in Limerick Regional.Construction of a new critical care block in Limerick Regional Hospital is proceeding and this project is expected to be completed in the latter half of 2012.There has been no indication of any mortality rate increase in the Mid West region since 2009 arising from the reorganisation of hospital and related services.

In addition the Irish Government provides a monthly payment of up to €1,109.  The majority are in receipt of the maximum payments from both Germany and Ireland.  All of these payments are tax free.  Each individual automatically receives a medical card.  Combining the German and the Irish payments Irish survivors of thalidomide receive on average a tax free payment of €26,000 per annum or €2,166 each month.In accordance with the Programme for Government I met with both representative bodies of Irish survivors of thalidomide last Friday 15th July.  I listened to their proposals for additional health care supports and financial assistance.  I undertook to consider their proposals and have further discussions with them.

With regard to health care the principle is that persons exercising their right to move and stay freely within this area do not suffer disadvantage in accessing or paying for health services.  The Regulations are binding on all member states and do not allow for any discretion in establishing entitlement.  Therefore, a pensioner in receipt of a qualifying pension in a member state is entitled to access health care in another member state on the same basis as persons who are insured with and resident in that other member state.  In Ireland, such a pensioner will be granted a medical card on production of the relevant form establishing entitlement.  The cost of the health care is the responsibility of the member state to which the person is linked.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1068	The Health Service Executive (HSE) and the State Claims Agency (SCA) recently published details of the number of incidents of harm and near misses, which were reported by hospitals and community based health care facilities in 2010. The SCA works with the HSE to record and analyse incidents that are reported in our health care system.The data is not available in the format requested by the Deputy.  The total number of incidents reported in 2010 was 83,483 (56% in acute services and 44% in Primary, Community and Continuing Care services).  The  total number in incidents reported in 2009 was 83,847.  The number of incidents reported is in line with international reporting.  In Ireland there is now clear evidence of an enhanced culture of reporting and that the majority of serious incidents are being reported.Slips, trips and falls are by far the most common incident that occur in a health care setting.  Health care services have developed a range of policies, which are now in place right across various parts of the system, to minimise slips, trips and falls.Medication errors account for 8% of the incidents reported.  The HSE has established a Medication Safety Programme to help reduce medication errors.  The programme will work to encourage health care professionals to be vigilant for allergies and to give advice on how to prevent inadvertent administration of allergenic.  In 2011, the programme will also be developing a national drug administration record.Recording this information and examining it is an essential part of developing the patient safety agenda. The information informs future planning of health services, allows analysis of trends and gives services an opportunity to consider their own record in terms of patient safety. This forms a vital part of learning where issues exist so that steps can be taken to improve services.

My Department has consulted widely on this issue and is preparing legislative proposals on the donation and use of human organs for transplantation.  These proposals will be included in a Human Tissue Bill which will also take into account the recommendations of the Madden Report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures.  My Department is working to finalise the proposals for me as soon as possible.In addition to consent systems, there is evidence from other countries that good co-ordination at hospital level and counselling arrangements for relatives are significant factors in achieving high organ donation rates.  I am therefore also considering what practices and organisational  changes could further improve donation rates in this country.  I welcome the establishment of a National Office for Organ Donation and Transplantation by the HSE.  The Clinical Lead in that Office will endeavour to enhance organ donation in Ireland and underpin the quality of outcomes for patients following organ donation in line with the standards set in Directive 2010/53/EU on quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation.

The figure in relation to the statutory hospitals is an audited figure taken from the HSE Annual Financial Statements, whereas the Voluntary Hospital numbers are subject to audit but would not be expected to differ in any material way.Where private patients occupy public beds in public hospitals, no income is generated by the hospitals, with the exception of the €75 statutory inpatient charge.  This charge applies to all patients, unless exempt, and hospitals do  not break down the statutory charge between public and private patients.  In 2010, €40m was raised in statutory inpatient charges.

This included payments to pharmacists and wholesalers under the following schemes:Schemes€mGeneral Medical Services Scheme1,260.24High Tech Scheme331.3Drug Payment Scheme263.47Long Term Illness Scheme139.76Methadone Treatment10.56European Economic Area Scheme1.96Health (Amendment) Act 19961.8Dental Treatment Scheme0.79The balance of €254 million relates to hospital drugs and medicines supplied under ‘hardship' arrangements. It was previously estimated that savings of approximately €23 million per year could be made if there was full generic substitution of medicines supplied under the GMS and other community drugs schemes. This figure was based on 2008 prices, 2008 ingredient costs and the availability of generics at that time. Since then the reimbursement prices of all medicines have reduced thus reducing the potential savings from increased usage of generic medicines. Discussions are currently ongoing with generic manufacturers with regard to further reductions in the prices of generic medicines. The breakdown of expenditure on generic and non-generic medicines in hospital settings is not available. Expenditure on medicines in a hospital is managed as part of the overall hospital budget.In 2009 16.4% of medicines supplied by the HSE under the GMS and other community drugs schemes were generics. There is significant scope to increase the usage of generic medicines in Ireland. The corresponding figures for the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Austria are 67%, 57%, 45.5% and 40.2% respectively.The Department is finalising the Heads of the Pricing and Supply of Medicines Bill. This legislation will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines. A number of high volume medicines are expected to come off patent in the coming years and this legislation will increase the scope for savings through the greater use of generic medicines. It is expected that the legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in significant savings for taxpayers and patients.

However, there is no overall estimate of the cost of potentially inappropriate prescribing in Ireland.The HSE is implementing a range of initiatives to maximise the appropriate prescribing of medicines. These include working in partnership with key health professionals to develop pathways for quality prescribing, promoting an extended role of the use of clinical protocols for the delivery of evidence-based prescribing and developing the role of community pharmacists and the introduction of patient-held prescribing records. In addition, the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service has introduced an on-line facility for GPs to review and self-audit their individual prescribing practice in comparison with the national average, which has been standardised for the individual GP's patient profile.I have recently indicated that I intend to take an initiative to carry out a closer examination of prescribing patterns and I hope to finalise the details of this initiative shortly.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system.  The aim of this reform is to deliver a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to care based on need, not income.While universal health insurance is the ultimate destination of this Government's reform programme, there are a number of important stepping stones along the way and each of these will play a critical role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance.A key immediate priority is the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) which I announced on the 1st of June.   The SDU's priorities will encompass reducing the waiting times for admission to Emergency Departments, reduction in in-patient and out-patient waiting times and improved access to diagnostics.  I have appointed  Dr Martin Connor, an international expert, to head up the SDU.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals on how best it can be placed on a permanent footing within the next six months.  The resources of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) will be refocused to align with the work of the SDU, and crucially, will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the nation's hospitals.A further fundamental element in the reform process involves significant strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.  This commitment will be achieved on a phased basis to allow for the recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals.  The implementation programme will be overseen by the Minister of State for Primary Care, assisted by a project team of officials from the Department and the HSE.Reform of the funding system for hospital care is also necessary.  This will involve the introduction of a more transparent and efficient "Money Follows the Patient" funding mechanism and the introduction of  a purchaser / provider split, whereby hospitals will be established as independent, not for profit trusts. To achieve this a number of initiatives are already underway in 2011 including a patient level costing project which involves tracing resources actually used by individual patients from the time of entry and admission to hospital until time of discharge.  The HSE has also implemented a prospective funding mechanism for selected elective orthopaedic procedures, at selected sites.Other important initiatives which will prepare the system for universal health insurance include the establishment of a new risk equalisation scheme for the private health insurance market, and the financial restructuring and authorisation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.    I commissioned a report in April on the opportunities for rebalancing risk in the private health insurance market.  This report will be submitted to me by the end of July 2011.  In addition, I have asked the Health Insurance Authority, as the regulator of the private health insurance market, to examine the issue of provider costs in the market.  I am currently reviewing the HIA's proposals on how this issue might be addressed.The Government is also committed to the publication of a White Paper on Financing Universal Health Insurance   which will outline the estimated costs associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  However, it must be emphasised that the precise cost of universal health insurance will significantly depend on the success of reform measures, such as those outlined above, over the next 3-4 years.The Government has recently given approval for an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance.  I am currently finalising details of the Implementation Group and I will announce these in due course.

The 2009 report shows that the number of agreements between the HSE and GPs was 2,663. This includes the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme which covers medical card and GP visit card holders, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 — (Hepatitis C Patients), Heartwatch and the Methadone Treatment Scheme. This statistical report is available on the website www.pcrs.ie. The full list of payments to individual GPs for services under the GMS contract in 2009 is also available on this website.There is no defined termination period for the renewal of these contracts, however GPs have a right to terminate their contracts, as they feel appropriate and the HSE can also terminate the contracts in certain circumstances.  I have no function in schemes provided by the Department of Social Protection.The other information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However I have asked the Health Service Executive to supply this information to me and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Regulations under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) came into effect on 22nd December 2010. This applied an overall reduction of about 9% to a range of GP fees and allowances, which will result in full year savings in the region of €44m.Under section 9 (13) of the FEMPI legislation, the Minister for Health is required to carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed under the regulations each year. This will involve full consultation with stakeholders.  Any disproportionate impact on particular categories of GPs will be considered as part of this review process.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1098	I recognise that the management of funding allocations by public hospitals poses a serious budgetary challenge. It is clear that if existing spending trends remain unchecked there will be a significant overrun at the end of this year. I have made it clear that such an overrun is not acceptable given the state of the public finances and this country's obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding with the IMF and EU.  I am in ongoing contact with the HSE to ensure that all necessary steps are being taken to avoid any budgetary overruns while at the same ensuring the maintenance of services in line with the commitments given by the HSE and public hospitals.I am on record as saying that every individual agency must take responsibility and do everything possible to stay within budget while delivering their planned level of service. Under its reform programme the Government has committed to achieving greater efficiencies in patient care and service delivery.  These efficiencies will not be easy to achieve but I am certain that over time they will help to ensure that more people get access to services within a given quantum of funding.  In this regard it is important that the management capacity in our public hospitals is sufficiently robust to meet these challenges.The Deputy will also be aware that it is the role of the Special Delivery Unit, which I recently established, to address issues around the better and more efficient delivery of health services.  The work of the SDU will contribute significantly to improving outcomes for patients and to greater efficiencies in the system.

Certain other grades are paid a single rate.The Chief Executive Officer of the HSE is currently in receipt of a salary of €273,796.  This is a net figure, following the recent 15% voluntary reduction agreed to by the CEO.The Health Sector Consolidated Salary Scales, which are prepared and issued by my Department, set out the rates of pay and allowances for staff in the public health service, in accordance with public pay policy.  I have arranged for a copy of the full set of health sector salary scales to be provided to the Deputy directly, and for a copy to be placed in the Oireachtas library.With regard to expenses, arrangements are in place in the HSE whereby staff may claim travel and subsistence payments in respect of relevant expenses incurred in the course of official duties.  Subsistence rates are prescribed in respect of overnight stays away from the employee's home.  Similarly, travel rates are set at a fixed amount per mile/kilometre travelled.  The Executive issues circulars across the organisation from time to time, setting out the applicable rates.  All travel and subsistence claims must be signed off by the appropriate line-manager, who must be satisfied that they are in order, prior to their approval. The Executive also has a foreign travel policy in place.  This policy highlights the importance of ensuring economy and value for money in all travel arrangements.

Day services include medical and surgical, elective endoscopy and elective orthopaedic surgery.  There is a 12 hour Medical Assessment Unit and an out patient department incorporating orthopaedic, gynaecology, ophthalmology and paediatric clinics.  Other services include day medical cardiology, day diabetic, radiology, laboratory, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.At present Navan Hospital also continues to provide a twenty-four hour Emergency Department. I have stated that any changes to the operation of the Emergency Department can only be carried out after significant improvement in the performance of the Emergency Department at Drogheda.In order to fully consider the issues involved, I will be taking account of the current organisation of acute services in the region and the important clinical programmes being developed by the HSE.  I acknowledge the need for communication with the local community at this time and understand that the HSE is available to meet with community representatives, as I am myself.In this regard, I met with the consultants in Navan Hospital and with the Save Navan Hospital Alliance last week. At that meeting I set out the position with regard to the Emergency Department at Navan Hospital. I am absolutely clear that, due to need to ensure the safe delivery of services and best outcomes for patients, changes need to take place at the Emergency Department.  However I have been equally clear that such changes need to be carried out in a planned way and that there will be full consultation on any changes. I estimate that it will be at least six months before any changes to the Emergency Department in Navan can be effected.

This spans a thirteen year period of widespread reform, huge technological advances, service expansion and fundamental change in our health system.  The names and cost of these reports are set out in the tables below. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible, given the large number of reports in question, to list all of the recommendations arising from these reports which are or have been implemented.Health is an extremely complex environment involving a broad spectrum of primary and acute care services for the entire population, ranging from services for children and families, services for older people, mental health services and disability services. The nature, cost and burgeoning demand for services require that a strong emphasis be placed on the evidence base for policy and resource usage.Many of the reports can be traced back to the development of services for cancer, cardiovascular health, health promotion and the subsequent evaluation of these strategies. A number of the reports deal with complex and ethical issues, for example, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction and the Green Paper on Abortion.A strong feature of a number of the reports related to engagement in widespread public consultation. National and international expert advice are critical and vital components in the development of health strategy.Reports have also been commissioned in the area of standards in health care. It is often argued that we don't give sufficient attention and prominence to the development and articulation of standards or best practice in the area of health and personal social services.  Medical error is a feature of medical systems world-wide and Ireland is no exception. The reports of Independent Inquiries form an important part of the body of knowledge which reflects a responsive and accountable health system. Examples of these include the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of Persons with Haemophilia and Related Matters and the Fitzgerald and Doherty reports into cancer misdiagnosis. Such Inquiries serve the public interest and ensure that we take appropriate corrective action to learn from experience and address the systems failures.The commissioning of external reports is very much part of a modern and effective administrative system and helps to inform the development of policy, regulation and legislation for the health sector as well as serving the public interest. There is, and will continue to be, a need for objective, independent and expert review and evaluation of health services and health outcomes into the future.Name of ReportCostAdding Years to Life and

My Department has not received a proposal in relation to the development of a clinical trial site in Ireland.The Department is working on the development of a plan for rare diseases in Ireland which will optimise the recognition, diagnosis, prevention and management of rare diseases. This work will include issues such as research and access to clinical trials. It is expected that the report will be completed in 2012.

This information is collated from four primary sources — the Coroner Service, the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry Scheme, the Central Treatment List maintained by the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the General Mortality Register.  Information is also collated from the Family Support Network.  Figures are available for the years 2004-2008, with those for 2009 becoming available in the autumn.  Drug-related deaths are defined as poisoning (directly related to drug use) or non-poisoning (indirectly related to drug use — medical causes and trauma).Figures for the Cabra, Glasnevin and North Inner City areas, based on the electoral divisions listed below, are as follows:200620072008Number of poisoning deaths192035Number of non-poisoning deaths333133Total525168While the Indices do not distinguish deaths that were drug crime-related, I can advise that 38 of the 97 non-poisoning deaths in the 2006-2008 period arose from instances of trauma.(The Electoral Divisions covered are Arran Quay A, Arran Quay B, Arran Quay C, Arran Quay D, Arran Quay E, Ballybough A, Ballybough B, Cabra East A, Cabra East B, Cabra East C, Cabra West A, Cabra West B, Cabra West C, Cabra West D, Finglas North A, Finglas North B, Finglas North C, Finglas South A, Finglas South B, Finglas South C, Finglas South D, Inns Quay A, Inns Quay B, Inns Quay C, Mountjoy A, Mountjoy B, North City, North Dock B, North Dock C, Rotunda A and Rotunda B.)

I have referred the Deputy's Question to the authority for direct reply.  The Deputy should advise my office if he does not receive a reply within ten working days.  In my announcements of 8 and 24 June respectively, I clarified the terms of reference and the membership of the Taxi Regulation Review Group, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The review will enable the necessary further reforms of the sector to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly  by operating  under a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced.  It will address a wide range of issues relating to the taxi sector including the current regulatory policy and practices, licensing systems, enforcement and future dialogue with the taxi sector.  The consultation on the review extends to all interested parties and stakeholders through an invitation for written submissions to be made by 5 August 2011.

Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and part funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table:Year€000 Subhead funding available€000 Payments made2009€56,000€58,7382010€48,000€50,042In both years the payments made exceeded the Estimates provision.  This was because of virements of savings from other subheads to the Sports Capital subhead.  The list of money spent under the Sports Capital Programme in 2009 and 2010 will be provided to the Deputy separately.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1124	I am not aware of any current proposal by Bus Éireann or Iarnród Éireann to increase fares. Iarnród Éireann fares were increased by an average of 3% in February last, following approval by the National Transport Authority (NTA).  The recently published CIÉ accounts for 2010 showed a deficit of €53.597 million for 2010.  In the context of such figures, and the fact that the state subvention to public transport providers will decrease over the next number of years, I highlighted in public comment that the CIÉ companies will be required to look at further cost savings, service rationalisation and fare increases.  Cost-cutting should take precedence over fare increases and service reductions but fare increases and service reductions will be inevitable if costs cannot be reduced sufficiently.  I have communicated this also to the newly appointed Chairpersons of CIÉ and its subsidiaries.  Of course, any proposal by the CIÉ companies to vary bus or rail passenger fares requires the approval of the NTA.

The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply.  The Deputy should advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within 10 working days.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1128	Information in relation to the number of scheduled flights using Cork Airport on an annual basis for the past five years is included in the Dublin Airport Authority's (DAA) Annual Report, a copy of which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year and which is available in the Library of the Houses.  The annual accounts are also available from www.daa.ie.  With regard to the quarterly figures, these are an operational matter for the DAA. As such, this question has been referred directly to the DAA for reply to the Deputy. If a response has not been received within ten working days, the Deputy should advise my private office.  The Government’s recent Jobs Initiative includes a number of measures to encourage inbound tourism, one of which is a new growth incentive scheme which was introduced by the DAA in recent months.  This new growth incentive scheme is due to run for the period 2011-2014.  Passenger service charges at the three State airports will be rebated to the airlines once the threshold of the previous year’s traffic total has been surpassed at the airport in question.  The rebates to airlines will be in line with their contribution to the overall growth at the airport.  This scheme is in addition to a range of other incentive schemes on offer to airlines at the three State airports.  I would encourage all airlines to avail of these generous incentive schemes.

The size and availability of funding for the delivery of a Smarter Travel Areas programme of any scale must be considered in the context of the Government's and my Department's overall priorities.  I appreciate that a great deal of enthusiasm and effort was displayed by Local Authorities in the Smarter Travel Areas application process and Local Authorities involved will be notified of the outcome shortly.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1131	As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) on December 2009, the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as the Kildare Route Project Phase 2, comes under the remit of the NTA.  The legislative basis for this is Section 11(1)(e) of the Dublin Transportation Act 2008 — Principal Functions of Authority — which states “the principal functions of the Authority are to secure the provision of public transport infrastructure”.  With that in mind, I have referred the Deputy’s question to the NTA for direct reply.  I ask the Deputy to advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within ten working days.

I will arrange to forward the Deputy's question to my colleague, the Minister for Health for direct response in this regard.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1133	The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.  A total of €439,676,000 is being provided for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads in 2011.  This includes the additional €60 million provided by the Government under the jobs initiative.  From this allocation, Kildare County Council has been allocated a total of €13,229,847.  My Department received an application from Kildare County Council in November 2008 for 100% funding of the Athy Southern Distributor Road at an estimated cost of €42 million.  A grant of €150,000 was allocated to the Council in 2011 to allow certain design and planning work on this project to be undertaken.  A review of all capital expenditure is being undertaken at present. It is only when that review process is completed that future allocations can be determined.  I am not in a position to give any commitment regarding the provision of further funding for this road in the future.

The publication of such commercially sensitive information before the completion of the competitive procurement processes would prejudice the State's capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of these projects.  In addition, these projects are being reviewed as part of the Government's recently announced capital expenditure review.  Obviously, the delivery of the Metro North project and the Dart Underground project will cost several billion each, while Luas BXD will cost several hundred million.  All tendering for construction works relating to public projects must comply with EU and national procurement rules.  The Capital Works Management Framework, overseen by the Department of Finance, sets standard contracts for public projects including relating to terms and conditions of employment.  These are used by all State agencies including those under the aegis of my Department sponsoring major projects such as Metro North, Luas BXD and DART Underground.  Any new versions of these standard contracts arising from future legislative changes would be adopted by the agencies as required.  Subject to compliance with the above, the employment of individuals on public projects is a matter for the successful contractor.

This review which is being overseen by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  is now under way.The review requires that all proposals for both new and ongoing public capital funding to 2016 in all sectors be examined to establish a set of priority projects and programmes that will support economic recovery, provide employment opportunities and are affordable having regard to the current financial realities.  The results of the review will form the basis of the new National Development Plan which should be finalised in the Autumn.As part of the review process all agencies funded by my Department were requested to make submissions supporting their programmes and setting priorities in a scenario of reduced allocations.  These submissions have informed my Department's conclusions on the  priorities for funding in the transport, tourism and sport sectors from 2012 to 2016.  My Department's response has  recently been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Irish rules on driver licensing operate within the framework of EU law, which means that we have reciprocal exchange relationships with other EU countries and with countries whose licensing regime is compatible with EU standards.In the case of Canada, each of the Canadian provinces has its own licensing regime, with different standards in each case. This poses difficulties for potential recognition. However, I understand that there have been discussions recently between the Road Safety Authority and the Canadian authorities to explore whether it would be possible to agree some form of exchange relationship. It is my understanding that not all of the Canadian provinces were interested in pursuing the matter at this stage.I have, of course, no objection in principal to agreeing an exchange relationship of this type with Canada and will give the matter careful consideration if it proves possible to reach an agreement which would involve all of the different Canadian provinces and their respective licensing systems.

This involves broadening the pool from which Board directors are appointed by publically seeking expressions of interest for such appointmentsMy Department have already commenced this process and, with the assistance of the Public Appointments Service, have sought expressions of interest. In making future appointments, I will be fully cognisant of the commitment in the programme for Government that all State Boards should have at least 40% of each gender.It should be noted that of the more than 280 people who have contacted my office to express an interest in serving on state boards through this process, less than 50 were women. I will shortly be issuing a new call for expressions of interest on a rolling basis. To help redress this imbalance, I would encourage as many qualified and interested women as possible to apply.
