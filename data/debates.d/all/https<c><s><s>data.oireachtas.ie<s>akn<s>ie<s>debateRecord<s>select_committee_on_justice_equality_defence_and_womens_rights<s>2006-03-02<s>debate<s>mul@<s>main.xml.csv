In page 9, lines 39 and 40, to delete subsection (2).Subsection (1) states: "Any person who commits genocide, a crime against humanity or a war crime is guilty of an offence." Subsection (2) states: "Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Genocide Act 1973 (the “1973 Act”) is repealed.” It seems strange to repeal an Act and leave sections extant, like being a little bit pregnant. Either the Act stands or it does not. If the Act is repealed, then none of its sections should survive. Even if it has been re-enacted in the Bill, it is strange to repeal an Act and leave two sections. Subsection (3) states, “The repeal effected by subsection (2) is without prejudice to the obligations of the State”.Amendment No. 13 concerns the Schedule to the 1973 Act and deals with the same point. If the Act is repealed, then surely the Schedule should also be repealed. It seems impossible to retain a Schedule if an Act is repealed. Is amendment No. 56 mine?

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I understand the points the Deputy is making but I will make a number of points in reply. Under the Interpretation Act 1937, where a repeal is made and unless a contrary intention appears, there are certain consequences. In this case an unusual provision is being inserted by way of subsection (4), which states: "Notwithstanding subsection (2), proceedings under the 1973 Act may be taken after the commencement of this section for an offence under that Act committed before such commencement.” That is an unusual provision in law. Normally when something is repealed, existing proceedings are preserved. It is sometimes necessary to make it clear that the right to prosecute is not being abolished. It is not usual to make the repeal of an Act subject to another provision but certain consequences flow from the Interpretation Act 1937. This makes clear the meaning of this repeal in respect of, first, the State’s obligations as set out in subsection (3) and, second, the entitlement after the commencement of this section to prosecute an offence committed before the commencement.Deputy Costello's amendments effectively amount to a proposal that the Genocide Act 1973 remain on the Statute Book and the genocide convention be appended to the Bill. The decision to repeal the Genocide Act 1973 was taken because the crimes concerned are totally and comprehensively encompassed in section 7 which creates the offence of genocide, among other offences. The definition of genocide contained in Article 6 of the Rome Statute is identical to that in Article 2 of the genocide convention. It affirms that the crime is punishable not only when committed in armed conflict, but when committed in peacetime, whenever and wherever it is committed.The Rome Statute is appended to the Bill, and so the definition of genocide, which is identical to that of the genocide convention, is already appended to the Bill. Having only one legislative provision, the ICC Bill, gives access to the ICC and Rome Statute provisions regarding legal advice for suspects, which are not referred to in the genocide convention.To recap, section 7 creates, among others, the domestic offence of genocide. As a new offence of genocide has been created, there is no further need for the old offence contained in the 1973 Act. That provision is consequently being repealed. With regard to the convention, Ireland continues to be a signatory and is bound by the terms. The repeal of the Act does not mean we are internationally released from our obligations under the convention. It merely replaces the obligations under the convention, now contained in the Genocide Act 1973, with those set out in this Bill. We are now complying with our obligations under the convention in this Bill rather than under the Genocide Act 1973.Section 7(3) makes it clear that the repeal of the Genocide Act 1973 is without prejudice to Ireland's ongoing and unchanging obligations under the genocide convention. Subsection (4) makes it clear to anybody prosecuted after the proposed commencement of this Act that, notwithstanding the repeal of the 1973 Act, they still face prosecution under its terms. As the committee knows, we cannot make retrospective legislation, but we can preserve the right to prosecute under a repealed Act.

The manner in which this is done is extremely clumsy. The Bill states "Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Genocide Act 1973 (the "1973 Act") is repealed." Why does the Genocide Act 1973 have to be repealed?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	7	On Report Stage, we may take out "Subject to" and replace it with "Notwithstanding". It is slightly unusual to have something repealed subject to a condition. I take the Deputy's point about the term being slightly pregnant. It will either be repealed or it will not. We will make it clear. It may be more elegantly phrased if it states "Notwithstanding".
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I still have difficulties with it. I realise the Minister is indicating that a provision should be included to continue the right to prosecute, etc. However, with regard to the two subsections being held in place, would it have been possible to include the two subsections in the legislation rather than going through this unwieldy process? The Act could then be repealed in toto rather than the way proposed by the Minister. This is the principle which we spoke of previously, that legislation should be accessible to the lay person. Including this provision makes the legislation totally inaccessible. While it may be needed in this form for some legal procedure, it is so cumbersome and clumsy that it is difficult to see it being operated in any manageable fashion.There are a number of Schedules to the Bill as it is: Schedule 1, the statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome in 1998; Schedule 2, the agreement on the privileges and immunities of the International Criminal Court; Schedule 3, other consequential amendments. The underlying Schedule is the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1948. That is the seminal convention from which all of this legislation ultimately flows.Unless there is something in that convention that is no longer relevant, I would think it would be pertinent to include it within the body and corpus of the Bill, in order that people could see at a glance the background and the pillar underpinning what we are dealing with. It is the same principle that clarity is a wonderful thing in legislation, and there is very little of it in evidence here. The reason we have so many people in a lucrative profession is because nobody can understand what is going on, and do not have the resources to check everything. The inclusion of this relevant Schedule would be valuable in putting together a comprehensive Bill.

The reference to the text of which is set out in the Schedules of the 1973 Act prevent us from putting it in the Statute Book in two places. It will be on the Statute Book even though the Act is repealed. If anybody wishes to consult it, it is there to see as a public document and will be available to any lawyer.It is not necessary to reproduce it in this Act. The terms of the genocide offence and the definition of genocide are identical. It is a matter of historical interest for lawyers.

In page 10, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:"(2) Where the State has ratified an international instrument providing that a specified offence shall be contrary to international law, the Minister may by order apply this Act, with such modifications as are appropriate, to such offence as if it were an ICC offence.".

Deputy Ó Snodaigh has indicated he wishes to do something similar on Report Stage. I have some reservations — I am not 100% clear — about allowing a Minister to extend the ambit of this Act to other sections by way of delegated legislative authority. There is a question mark as to whether it was an impermissible delegation of legislative authority. Whereas there could be two schools of thought on that issue I certainly do not want this Bill referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution because we have done something which it was not necessary to do. If there is some change in the ambit of the Rome Statute at some stage in the future, it is right that the Irish Legislature should go back to it and decide whether it is happy to extend the ambit of the Act, in so far as that new offence is concerned, to make whatever procedural changes it wishes.

In page 10, subsection (4), line 24, to delete "this section" and substitute “section 7(1) or 8(1) as the case may be”.This is a technical amendment designed to correct the references in the section.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	That may be as the Deputy sees it but I am advised that section 9(4) provides that apart from proceedings taken under the Genocide Act, proceedings may not be taken for acts constituting an ICC offence that occurred before the commencement of section 9. The amendment proposes to delete the reference to the commencement of section 9 and instead insert a reference to the commencement of section 7(1) and section 8(1) as the case may be.By way of background, section 7(1) creates the offence of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and section 8(1) creates offences ancillary to those offences. One apparent difficulty with the approach proposed by the Deputy is that it seems to leave open the possibility that section 7(1) and section 8(1) could be commenced at different times in that the amendment refers to the commencement of sections 7(1) or 8(1) as the case may be. Because sections 7(1) and 8(1) are so closely intertwined one could not envisage any circumstance where the sections would be commenced separately. In addition, the Bill as drafted, does not have any commencement clause whereby different Parts of the Bill could be brought into operation at different times. Consequently all the provisions will come into operation on the same day. In effect, therefore, the reference to the commencement of section 9, means the commencement of section 7(1) and section 8(1) because there cannot be, as the Bill is constructed, two different dates for the commencement of those sections.

Would it be possible for the commencement to occur before the signing of the Rome Statute because that is what the State indicated was our intention? The Minister said the law cannot be retrospective but the intention was clear that the full International Criminal Court was being signed up to and all its effects.

In other words, if a Garda sees a well-known genocidal suspect walking down the street he can arrest him, bring him to Pearse Street Garda station and before the District Court and apply for his remand in custody or on bail as the case may be. At that stage the Director of Public Prosecutions has to intervene before anything else can happen.

I will come back to the Deputy on that. I will also come back to him on whether it is open to a common informer to commence a prosecution under this legislation, and it may well be if the right to commence proceedings is open to everyone. In other words, it may be open to the Deputy to go to the District Court to take out a summons claiming that I am a person to whom the legislation applies. It is not always a question of a garda being involved. One can take out a summons.

The section, as it is composed, provides that a person convicted of an International Criminal Court offence is liable to imprisonment for life if the offence involves murder, or a term of life imprisonment. There is a third provision included of a period of imprisonment not exceeding 30 years. My point is that the penalty is either life imprisonment or it is not. The third provision is in the wrong place. One cannot have a term of imprisonment not exceeding 30 years under a heading of life imprisonment or at least it should not be included.

The word "to" is omitted at the start but appears in the middle of paragraph (c). The paragraph reads, “if the person has obtained property as a result of or in connection with the offence, to having a confiscation order made in respect of him or her”.

It states: "Sums recovered under a confiscation order made in relation to an ICC offence shall, if the court so directs, be applied wholly or partly in reparation to victims of the conduct constituting the offence." I agree entirely with this provision. It is a desirable aspiration or even more than that given that it is included in legislation. In the context of the sums mentioned, presumably that refers to sums held domestically on which we can lay our hands. Does it also refer to sums abroad which the Criminal Assets Bureau or some other mechanism can be used to secure? In this context, presumably we are talking about people who are victims within our jurisdiction or victims who are living within this jurisdiction and persons who might be arrested and charged.

It is a territorial notion that the assets in question would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts. I do not believe we are assuming international jurisdiction over the proceeds of genocide because that could give rise to all sorts of problems.I will give Deputy an example of that. In the case of works of arts stolen from people who were sent to the gas chambers during the Holocaust, are we going to place an obligation on the Irish courts, simply because they convict a person of genocide, to begin investigating where the proceeds of the crime went internationally? That is not a realistic exercise for the Irish State to undertake.

If a person, having fled from another jurisdiction, is charged of crimes against humanity in this jurisdiction and he or she has wealth or assets lodged in some bank or institution here, would that be the type of situation where the Minister would envisage such funds being seized and the victims concerned being given reparation?

I do not want to give the Irish courts or the criminal court here a function of further following up on civil assets and arguing about whether a work of art which is now hanging somewhere was or was not taken from a victim of genocide.

Who would do this work? Would it be the Director of Public Prosecutions and, if so, is that office to be reconfigured to chase up assets that are not in Ireland?
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	60	In the context of this subsection, in what situation would the Minister envisage it could be applied?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	If somebody came to Ireland fleeing another country, as in the example the Deputy gave, had the proceeds of genocide in his or her possession and a confiscation order was made on those assets, what I would have in mind is that the court would have general jurisdiction to direct that the assets would be confiscated and that instead of simply being forfeited to the Irish State, they would be used in some way. For instance, in the case of an atrocity such as the massacre at Srebrenica and if we are talking about an atrocity involving 5,000 people, I do not believe that the court could simply hand out the assets in some small form but it could be applied wholly or partly in reparation to victims of the conduct constituting the offence. It could go to relatives or to something in reparation for the offence. I do not believe it is possible to set out a scheme of application of the assets in more detail than that set out in subsection (3).

I can see the reason for an exception.

In page 11, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following subsection:"(2) an act done on an Irish ship or an Irish aircraft wherever situate, shall be deemed to have been done in the State.".This is to cover the unlikely event that there would be crimes against humanity perpetrated not just on Irish territory but in a transit vehicle such as an Irish ship or aircraft. The legislation appears to be silent on the matter so it would be useful to have a specific reference to cover that possible eventuality.

I propose to table a Government amendment to give effect to this amendment on Report Stage. I want an opportunity to include a definition of an Irish ship and an Irish aircraft. Since we are nit-picking, the Parliamentary Counsel advises that the phrase "wherever situate" because of the absence of commas could apply only to aircraft and it should be clear that it applies to ships as well.

In page 12, subsection (1)(b), line 19, after “intimidation” to insert the following:"and preventing publication of information tending to identify any injured party".This section relates to the protection of victims and witnesses. Section 14(1)(b) refers to: "the enactments or any rule of law relating to the protection of witnesses against intimidation". This appears to be a narrow interpretation of protection. Intimidation is not the only thing against which witnesses might require protection. They might, for example, require the protection of anonymity. Lives could be at risk in matters of this nature so it would be better to broaden the scope of the protection. The amendment seeks to prevent publication of information tending to identify any injured party. That should be of assistance in providing the anonymity that might be necessary in matters of this nature.

That is significant. The Deputy’s proposal is to prevent publication of information that might identify an injured party but that is too narrow even to accomplish his purpose. A witness might not be injured but might have seen terrible things happen and might require protection. I will re-examine this to see if Article 68 is brought into effect sufficiently by section 14. Witnesses and injured parties are not the same in every circumstance.

In page 12, lines 42 to 45 and in page 13, lines 1 to 3, to delete subsection (2).This is a little more nit-picking. This section deals with the interpretation of appeals proceeding, provisional arrest warrant and state of enforcement. Then there is another subsection which is not an interpretation but which has been grafted on. My intention is to separate subsection (1) from subsection (2) because the latter is not an interpretation subsection. The first amendment seeks to delete that subsection and amendment No. 20 inserts that subsection as a section, as distinct from an interpretation.

In page 13, before section 17, to insert the following new section:"17.—(1) In this section ‘surrender proceedings' means proceedings before the High Court for the surrender of a person to another state following receipt of—(a) a request under the Extradition Acts for his or her extradition to another state, or(b) a European arrest warrant (within the meaning of the Act of 2003) in respect of the person.(2) Where the Minister receives a request from the International Criminal Court for the arrest and surrender of a person under Article 89 and—(a) surrender proceedings in respect of the person have been instituted but have not been determined, or(b) the person is awaiting surrender to another state under the Extradition Acts or the Act of 2003,then, pending a decision by the Minister in accordance with Article 90 on whether priority should be given to the request—(i) the Minister shall notify the High Court of the request, and, on receipt of the notification, the Court may adjourn the proceedings for such period or periods as it thinks fit and remand the person in custody or, subject to section 25(2), on bail, or(ii) as the case may be, the person shall not be so surrendered.(3) If the Minister decides in accordance with Article 90 that priority should be given to the request from the International Criminal Court and—(a) the surrender proceedings have been so adjourned, the Minister shall cause the High Court to be notified of his or her decision, and, on receipt of the notification, the Court may order that the proceedings be discontinued and that the person concerned be brought before it to be dealt with in accordance with section 24, or(b) the person is awaiting surrender to another state, the person shall not be so surrendered, and sections 18, 19, 22 and 24 shall have effect in relation to the case.(4) If, having consulted the International Criminal Court, the Minister decides in accordance with Article 90 that priority should not be given to the Court's request—(a) the Minister shall cause the High Court to be notified accordingly, or(b) if the person is awaiting surrender to another state, subsection (2)(ii) shall cease to have effect in relation to the person concerned.(5) A discontinuance of surrender proceedings under subsection (3)(a) in respect of an offence is not a bar to instituting fresh such proceedings for it.(6) This section has effect notwithstanding anything in the Extradition Acts and is without prejudice to section 30(3) of the Act of 2003.".This amendment involves the substitution of section 17 of the Bill which deals with conflicting requests. The need to revise this section arises from the enactment of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 after the publication of the ICC Bill. The amendment takes account of the fact that a person's surrender may be requested under three distinctive legislative provisions. For example, a person wanted by the ICC may also be subject to a competing request for extradition pursuant to the Extradition Acts, or a European arrest warrant may have been issued in respect of that person. Accordingly, the revised section 17 of the Bill addresses the situation where two or more surrender requests are received concurrently for the same person, such as a request from the ICC and a European arrest warrant request.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	This amendment seeks to give the court a role on the re-entry of a case after it has been withdrawn in the circumstances outlined in section 18(4). Section 18 provides for a certification of requests from the ICC by the Minister. Where the person wanted by the ICC is also being investigated or proceeded against in the State concerning an offence that is not an ICC offence and the Minister decides to proceed with the ICC request, the other domestic proceedings must, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, be withdrawn with liberty to re-enter. The proposed amendment would make a specific reference to the domestic court refusing to allow proceedings to be re-entered if it saw sufficient reasons to the contrary.It must be remembered that the DPP must make the ultimate decision as to whether prosecution is appropriate in a particular case. We have an adversarial system, not one in which the court decides whether it will start or stop. It decides whether to hear applications made to it on whether proceedings are constitutional and fair. It is for the DPP to apply his or her mind as to whether it is appropriate to bring a prosecution and, by extension, whether to re-enter a case. The DPP is in a special position. It is generally thought undesirable for interested parties to participate in the DPP's decision or for the court to exercise a broad supervisory function over decisions of the DPP. The court has an inherent power to strike out or stay any proceedings where it considers that such proceedings amount to an abuse of process or are constitutionally prohibitive. Therefore, I do not accept the proposition.I do not want to give the court this explicit role of vetting it. It has a residual power to prevent its own process being abused. However, I want to maintain the primarily adversarial role where the DPP brings his re-entered matter before the court. If at that stage the defendant wants to argue that it should not be heard or allowed to proceed further, the defendant should be allowed to make that argument. I do not want to give the court some sort of inquisitorial role on re-entry matters.
