#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	The tracker mortgage scandal represents a damning indictment of the behaviour of our banks towards both our people and their customers. It also reveals, it would appear, a tardiness and certain reluctance on the part of the Central Bank to deal early and resolutely with the issue, particularly the systematic nature of the abuse that occurred and the part of the Government in allowing this scandal to drag on for far too long. I am sure the Minister would agree that the banks essentially stole people's money. They caused enormous damage to people's lives and a great deal of distress to families. Mr. Thomas Ryan's heart-rending testimony to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach last week revealed that damage in shocking terms - a stroke at the age of 47 and a nervous breakdown within the family. In many respects, it constitutes a failure of regulation and Government oversight that a man had to come before an Oireachtas committee with others to reveal all of that. What does it say about the system of regulation? What does it say about the ethos and culture of our banks that they would bring people to that level of shocking distress, resulting in individuals having to come before Dáil Éireann to articulate what happened to them? We know that 102 customers have lost their homes as a result of this scandal. The Central Bank would have had some indication of this as long ago as 2009 or 2010 - although it was not systematic at that stage - and it took it until 2015, when an investigation took place, for it to begin to be satisfied that this was systematic. It defies all credibility that 11 institutions would have acted independently. No credible explanation has been given as to how this happened in all of the banks at the same time. That matter needs to be pursued. The banks have been pathetically slow in the context of resolving these issues. It is interesting that some weeks ago representatives from Ulster Bank gave testimony to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that only 40 of its 3,500 mortgage holders had got their money back. KBC indicated that it had not contacted all of its customers. Yet there were no big announcements at that stage or ministerial meetings being profiled. It took last week's meeting of the committee to get some belated action from the Government. I put it to the Minister that there is a pattern here with, for example, the Government having been negative and adversarial towards my party's Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill 2016, which Deputy Michael McGrath put forward-----

Why did the Government not intervene earlier and more decisively on this issue? Is the Government going to increase the bank levy as was indicated last week? Has the Government told the banks to cease any repossession of mortgages affected by this scandal? Will the Government now proactively support our Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	The Government takes this issue very seriously. I am glad to understand that the two largest parties in this House have agreed upon a motion for tomorrow night. There is a very clear message coming from the Oireachtas in respect of how unacceptable the behaviour of banks has been in the context of the tracker mortgage scandal, which we are trying to bring to a conclusion. We had a Government meeting last night, most of which was taken up by a discussion on this issue. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has made it crystal clear that he sees this as a totally unacceptable breach of the kind of standards that banks should be applying. This is unfortunately a recognition that for some in Irish banks, there is still a cultural problem. It needs to change. We have seen both the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance make very clear and blunt statements on the need for banks themselves to respond in a more comprehensive way than has been the case to date. Clearly, different banks are behaving differently in terms of the pace of co-operation with the Central Bank. That is also something that needs to come to an end this week. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, met representatives of three banks yesterday, namely, Bank of Ireland, KBC and Permanent TSB. Today he will meet representatives of AIB and Ulster Bank. The Minister has given a very consistent message to all five that the Government regards their behaviour in this scandal as totally unacceptable. Banks should be there to serve an economy and a society as opposed to the other way around. There are families today who have lost homes and others who have lost properties because of the dishonest behaviour of banks in the context of tracker mortgages and their attempts to get people off them for some time now.  I want to give a very clear message to the House that the Minister, supported by the Government, is going to see this through. He will make a lengthy statement to the House tomorrow in the context of his meetings this week. We also expect comprehensive statements from all five banks addressing how they intend to bring this saga and scandal to an end and to ensure that people get their money back, as well as get the appropriate redress they are due. The damage that has been caused is, unfortunately, a further example of banks not acting in the interests of the public but acting in their own interests.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	4	The Minister did not answer the questions that I asked. The first one was whether the Government is going to increase the bank levy. I am not saying that is the optimal outcome but it was touted by the Government last week. Those were the screaming headlines last week indicating a tough response. Given that there was a lengthy discussion on it last evening at the Cabinet meeting, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, might clarify whether it is the Government's intention to increase the bank levy or add additional levies. What powers does the Central Bank have at the moment that it could use to penalise the banks more? Has the Government made it clear to the banks that all repossessions of properties affected by this scandal should cease? Has the Government a clear position on that? Will the Government proactively support our Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill? It would give additional powers to the Central Bank to be able to deal with the rip-off of up to 300,000 people in terms of their interest rates. We have been pursuing this now for quite some time yet there has been a negative, foot-dragging, almost adversarial approach from the Government. I put it to the Minister that this follows a pattern of standing back from the banks, standing by and allowing them do what they are doing, which is screwing customers on a continuous basis.There needs to be a change in the official approach to the banking system across the board.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	It is the role of the Central Bank, not the Government, to regulate the banking system. Should another a scandal occur, the type of which we are talking about today, the Government, if it needs to, will act. On the levy issue, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has made it clear that he has not been prescriptive in terms of what the Government will do until such time as he gets clarification from the banks this week on what they intend to do, but he has also made it clear that if the Government is not satisfied with the response this week from the banks there will be a further Cabinet meeting dealing with the detail of the options that are available to Government in that regard. In regard to the Central Bank, it already has extensive and significant powers to fine and a series of other powers. The suggestion that the consumer protection function should be taken from the Central Bank is misplaced.

What I am saying is that I do not believe any consumer protection regulator would have the power the Central Bank has. That function needs to remain with the Central Bank. We will have a comprehensive statement from the Government tomorrow. We expect a comprehensive statement from the banks also. If we do not get that, the Government will look at the options that are available to it. On the legislation issue, I will leave it to the Ministers concerned to discuss the detail in that regard. If the Central Bank indicates that it needs more power, it will get it from Government.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	9	First, I extend a very warm welcome home to Irish citizen and fellow Dubliner, Ibrahim Halawa. I am sure everybody will join me in extending to him and his family our warmest wishes as he readjusts to life back home. Céad míle fáilte ar ais. Fáilte abhaile, Ibrahim. I wish to raise the refusal of the Government to provide necessary funding to produce up-to-date research regarding the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report. This report, which documented the impact of sexual violence on the Irish population, is 15 years old and so many aspects of the 2002 research are outdated. The importance of updating this research cannot be overstated. Ms Noeleen Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has said that the Government "is in a situation where decisions are being made about how to combat sexual violence in Ireland which are based on evidence that is so out of date that it might as well be from Dickens". This matter was raised last week by our colleague, an Teachta Catherine Connolly. At that time, the Taoiseach, while professing to have an open mind on the subject, said that Government Departments have expressed a preference for the money to be directed into services rather than into funding new research. He also said: "Departments are satisfied with the statistics and the information that they have." The Department of Justice and Equality cited the Rape Crisis Network Ireland as the source of these statistics yet that organisation has clearly stated that it is no longer able to publish such statistics because of funding cuts. This was a cynical attempt on the part of An Taoiseach to pit two vital pillars in the combating of sexual violence against each other. It should not be a case of research or services. The message should not be that we can have one or the other because we clearly need both. In the absence of up-to-date information, how can we be certain that services are being properly allocated? The need to fund a new report is not without its supporters within the Government. I understand that members of Cabinet were asked to support the funding of a new report. I know that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has stated that the Government should fund the new study and that the Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Fitzgerald, has said that it is something the Government should consider. However, it seems that all of this has fallen on deaf ears. At the Fine Gael presidential dinner last Saturday night, the Taoiseach's open mind had closed shut.He confirmed that the Government would not fund a new report and said the money would instead go on legal aid. In so doing, he has again played the needs of research and services against each other. Both are required and should be properly funded. This is about choices. It would cost €1 million to produce this report. Five such reports could be produced for the cost of the Taoiseach's vanity project, the now infamous strategic communications unit. It is difficult to imagine that the Government could not find the money if it were so minded. I ask the Minister to come to his senses and commit to funding a new report.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	I also welcome the return of Ibrahim Halawa to Dublin this morning. I thank all Members, including the Ceann Comhairle, who helped make that happen, along with the many others who made Mr. Halawa feel very welcome on his return. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has spent more time on this case than any other in consular history. Many Members have been involved in a campaign to highlight the injustice in this case. I am glad that, despite four very difficult years, there has been a happy ending for the Halawa family. I hope to meet Mr. Halawa later today. On the comments made by the Taoiseach last week in respect of sexual assault and violence in Ireland, my understanding is that he has an open mind on this issue, as does the Government. He merely pointed out that if €1 million is to be spent in that area, regard must be had to the most acute current priorities. That question needs to be asked by the Government if it is to allocate fresh resources that were not provided for in the budget. That is not to say that the Government will not do this if it is the right thing to do. There is no disputing that the SAVI report was ground-breaking when it was published in 2002. However, much has happened since then, including the formulation of the first and second national strategies on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. There are additional sources of more recent data in respect of sexual violence. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights' study on violence against women in 2014 provided comparative prevalence data across the 28 member states and a Eurobarometer study provided comparative data for 2016 for each member state. The European Union statistics body, EUROSTAT, is gearing up to survey gender-based violence and victimisation. It is anticipated that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, will take part in any EU-wide victimisation survey. Existing Garda data on sexual crimes published by the CSO have also been strengthened, thus ensuring we have more robust current data. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, met the director of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Noeline Blackwell, this afternoon. The Government will consider the issue and if it is right to prioritise spending on research, that will be done. However, that decision has not yet been made and, therefore, I cannot announce it today.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	11	It is the right thing to do. Although the Minister has cited studies that have been and will be carried out, none are comparable to the SAVI report in terms of the depth of data produced and the depiction of the entire scope of sexual violence in Ireland. This is the right thing to do. The Minister is correct that it is about prioritisation. It is not lost on Members that €5 million was prioritised for the Government's strategic communications unit. In that context, it should be confirmed in the House today that €1 million will be prioritised to fund this very necessary research.This is not some additional bauble or concession to those in the world of research; it is absolutely essential to the guiding and shaping of our responses and our services to care for people who are victims of sexual violence. This is a necessary part of service provision and, to repeat, it is very wrong to suggest that one should choose services over up-to-date, reliable information.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	Neither the Taoiseach nor anyone else in Government has been pitting one against the other, and the Deputy should not present the matter in those terms because it is simply not true. The Government's commitment in respect of domestic and sexual violence is clear. We have the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, and more than €22 million in funding for the purpose of tackling domestic and sexual violence is now available within Tusla. This is an increase of €1.5 million on last year. There is a commitment on the part of the Government to try to deal with this issue comprehensively. The issue is whether we should now prioritise spend on further research to build on that which is already there but outdated. I will take my advice from the experts in this area through the Department. If trying to find €1 million for this research is the right thing to do, the Government will do it.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	18	On 19 September many of us were at a conference on mental health in Dublin Castle that the Minister had been instrumental in organising. Like many others, I sat there listening to the various presentations and inputs, and one could be forgiven for thinking we have a service that is comprehensive, extensive and accessible to those who present with mental health issues. Some progress is being made but I will highlight an area where absolutely no progress is being made, that is, dual diagnosis, the coexistence of substance misuse and a mental health issue in an individual. The mental health issue could range from psychosis or bipolar disorder to depression or an anxiety disorder. I know this is not the Minister's area of expertise but I hope my highlighting of it will enable him to have a conversation about it with the Minister for Health. There has been discussion on the demand and the need for this since the late 1990s. In 2004 a report by Dr. Liam MacGabhann of DCU raised two particular findings: first, that 76% of services failed to provide a specific service for those with dual diagnosis; second, that a majority of the service providers agree that a fully integrated service would be the most effective management of dual diagnosis. However, since then, there has been little or no movement except a downward movement. Mental health and addiction services are not currently able to treat people holistically because they are treating the condition and not the person. Addiction services address the addiction; mental health services address the mental health issue. However, a recent report indicates that two thirds of those who die by suicide have both addiction and mental health issues. Just 20 minutes ago I took a phone call from someone I know in this exact situation. Her brother has a psychotic condition and is being seen by a psychiatrist and being given medication. Because the condition is not being adequately addressed, this young man has been turning to alcohol and other drugs to try to deal with his symptoms. His behaviour has become much more aggressive, with the result that his family fear for their safety. They have had to call the Garda. He spent hours yesterday and today in a police station. He is currently in a police station waiting for an ambulance to take him to an accident and emergency department, where I doubt very much he will get the service he needs. The Minister will tell me a review of A Vision for Change is ongoing, but as dual diagnosis was not covered in A Vision for Change in the first place, there cannot be a review in this regard. He may also tell me a new national dual diagnosis service is being set up under the HSE. My question is whether the Minister will ensure there will be real collaboration between that service and those who work in this area and those who struggle with addiction. What they are hearing is that the model of care will be drawn up and then there will be a meeting. It seems there will be a top-down, specialist-driven, consultant-knows-best approach that will not take into account the views of those who are actively working in the area and those struggling with addiction, who have a voice themselves and can give their opinion. It will not do this young man or his family any good unless that collaboration happens.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	I do not profess to be an expert on this area. I thank the Deputy for acknowledging the limitations of what we can commit to here in the House. This was an issue we put a lot of focus on about a year ago in the context of homelessness, particularly in terms of the need for the State to intervene in a more comprehensive way to try to deal with both addiction and mental health in a way that was complementary, as opposed to a silo-based approach where there are two different approaches trying to deal with challenges people face that are very much intertwined with each other. If it would be helpful, I will happily arrange a meeting between the Minister, Deputy Harris, and Deputy O'Sullivan so she can talk to him in some detail about her specific concerns and proposals in the context of what the HSE is doing, the new national drugs strategy which has recently been published and the review of A Vision for Change. There is a lot happening within the Government to try to grapple with this policy issue. I suspect the Deputy has particular things she wants to raise in that context and I would happily try to facilitate that for her. I also point to the increased funding we have provided specifically around homelessness services. Identifying the multidisciplinary nature of the supports the State needs to provide is a very clear recognition of some of the issues the Deputy has been raising. The funding for homelessness services into next year will increase by some €18 million. Much of that support is in the context of family transition hubs, for example, and the supports for families and individuals in emergency accommodation will be focused on the type of multidisciplinary approach the Deputy is seeking.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	20	Collaboration and talking with those who are directly involved is vital because there are unique factors and unique needs with regard to those who are in addiction. We have made some progress in the north inner city and in supports for workers. However, in the west, for example, mental health services will not deal with somebody who is currently in addiction and, because there is no addiction service there, those people are left with absolutely nothing. There is also a need to look at the term "dual diagnosis", which is an old psychiatric term from the United States of the 1950s and 1960s. We are saying that, for those in addiction, it is a mental health issue. The other part of the triangle is those who are homeless. Many of those who are homeless are also presenting with a mental health issue. It is this integrated service, with people talking together and collaborating, that will give the best outcome. I am struck by the fact that the people I am talking about will not get next or near a mortgage, tracker or otherwise, unless they get into recovery. If they are in recovery, they will have their lives back and can do those things.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	I do not disagree with any of that. The most useful thing to do is to make sure the Deputy is fully plugged in to what the Government is doing in this area across different Departments, but in particular led by the Minister for Health in the context of mental health services. I will ensure there is a follow-up from the question today.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	22	The infamous American bank robber, Willie Sutton, once said: "You can't rob a bank on charm and personality." What the Irish banks have proven, however, is that one can indeed rob the people on charm and personality. I am referring to the latest example of our predatory banks' behaviour with respect to tracker mortgages. I believe it is important that we speak about this not only because of the obvious need to give redress to the victims of the institutional scam that has unfolded, but also because it is episodes like this that reveal where the real centre of power lies in this country, unfortunately. We in here might like to think that the Oireachtas and this House is where the authority resides but, sadly, we are being shown every day that this is not true and that it does not reside here at all. When scandals like this happen, those who are really in control are fully revealed, and we know who they are. The so-called pillar banks and others seem to have a free hand to do as they wish, when they wish, to whom they wish, and especially to the little people and the ordinary people. The attitude very much appears to be that if the people and families lose their homes, tough luck; if families unfortunately lost loved ones through suicide due to the stress of trying to meet mortgage repayments, that is their own tough luck.If the children must endure the pain and suffering of seeing their parents tormented, demented and driven to bad health by the debt and the bullying of the banks, is this their own fault as well? This is the kind of attitude that lies at the heart of our banking culture. It is rotten to the core and, worse, it appears that all regulatory attempts to get rid of it have utterly failed. The banks have done absolutely nothing to voluntarily disclose this latest fraud perpetrated upon tens of thousands of our people. Only when the glare of the public spotlight is forced upon them do they rush out with their pretence of sorrow. It is a small pretence. They know from experience that the best strategy is simply to ride it out and keep the head down. Soon the huffing and puffing and the tough talk of the Government will die down and it will be a return to business as usual. That is all we have seen so far but it will not and cannot ever be business as usual for the tens of thousands of families that have been affected. I spoke with a couple yesterday that had no idea, until last Friday, that they had been swindled by their lender Ulster Bank. They had no idea. They received a letter last Friday from Ulster Bank telling them that, as a result of an internal review, the bank was now aware that it had been overcharging this couple between 2009 and 2015. Ulster Bank explained to the family that even though they had a tracker mortgage the bank had taken it from them and they had not been on the tracker for the past six years. They purchased their house in 2005 but were forced to sell it in 2015. Ulster Bank informed them that they had been overcharged by €40,000. The couple was offered €4,000 by way of redress. Is this the banks' own summary justice system in operation out there for robbing? Ned Kelly robbed from the rich to give to the poor. The Minister is allowing the banks to do this but there is no one to take it off the rich now. Does the Minister agree that the people of this country have been taken for absolute fools by the shadowy cabal of bankers who seem to lack even the slightest element of social conscience? Will the Minister agree that some of these people need to be brought to justice, tried, handcuffed, brought before the courts and sentenced to prison? A prison sentence would be too good for them as far as I am concerned. They should be out rebuilding the lives of the families they have destroyed.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	23	Lest anybody be unaware of the extent and seriousness of this scandal, by the end of September €163 million had been provided back to 3,300 customers. By the end of this process we are talking about close to 30,000 customers who will be entitled to their money back and to redress. This will involve hundreds of millions of euro. This is money that was taken inappropriately from families right across the country, many of whom were put under huge pressure during that period. This is why people are rightly angered and they expect the Government and the Central Bank - independently of each other - to make sure the response is comprehensive. The Central Bank is engaging with other statutory bodies on this tracker mortgage examination, including An Garda Síochána. They will take the appropriate action in respect of what has happened. I share the Deputy's anger and frustration. I assure him that the Minister for Finance was not mincing his words yesterday when he briefed the Cabinet on this issue. This is not going to be a case of grandstanding for a number of days. The Central Bank will need to see this through with regard to the probe it started back in 2015. The Government will insist on getting a comprehensive answer from the banks on this so we can bring the saga to an end, sooner rather than later, and ensure people get their money back, as well as the appropriate redress they are due.

This has gone on for years. We see that the courts do not give protection to the families on these tracker mortgages either and the Central Bank is toothless, useless and totally fruitless. I suppose the banks brought some nice fruitcake in to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, when they came in yesterday for their nice little cosy chat. This is nonsense and a reply of total poppycock from the Government. The banks know that the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan - and I wish him the best of health - just totally ignored it. The new Minister has been in place for some time - the Minister opposite has been in government for nearly seven years - and absolutely nothing has been done. The bankers are friends and supporters of the Government. Members of the Government play golf with them and cannot deny that. The Government will not hurt them at all. Were it to slap them, it would ask how hard it was slapping them in case they were hurt altogether; child protection laws and everything else.The Minister has to act. Derision and the Taoiseach standing up to call it "shameful" is not enough. The Government must deal with the banks. There is no banking regulation in this country. They have run riot. We were all forced in here in September so many years ago to vote to save the banks but all we got back was the two fingers every time and to every customer. This is not the only robbery that is going on. We are used to seeing gardaí and couriers minding the cash but now the robbers are inside behind the counter. I do not mean the ordinary tellers but those who are deep in the board rooms. Where are the public service directors? They seem to have no function and if they are getting a salary, it is a shame. People are being robbed blind and it is time for the likes of Ned Kelly to resurrect himself for Tipperary. This is outrageous and the Government has shown the families no mercy. Notwithstanding the scale, the Government will do nothing other than to arrange a strong talk from the Minister. That will do nothing without serious action and legislation. If the banks are charged a levy, they will only pass it on to the customers. It is downright, naked fraud.

They are not the people who should be the target of our ire here. It is senior decision-making in banks that is responsible for what happened in this scandal and that is why it is the most senior decision-makers in banks that the Minister for Finance met yesterday and will meet again today. He will make a comprehensive statement tomorrow on the back of those meetings and we expect as a Government that the banks will also make comprehensive statements before the end of the week in an effort to bring an end to the issue. If they do not, the Government will have to consider further how it will respond.

During Leaders' Question, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said that the Minister for Finance would make a statement on the tracker mortgage scandal. Is it envisaged that this will happen during Fianna Fáil Private Members' time or will there be a separate statement in the House during Government time?

#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	46	No. We would like to propose that the Business Committee be convened later to discuss two amendments to the Order of Business for Thursday. First, given that Saturday is the fifth anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar and in view of the fact that Thursday is the closest Dáil sitting day to that, we would like the committee to consider that a minute's silence be organised in the House on that day in her memory. Second, given that there is to be a national rail strike next Wednesday - the first of five strike days - and that the Dáil is not sitting next week and in light of the fact that there are strong indications that the CEO of Irish Rail, with the support of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, collapsed the talks last week, time should be set aside that day to discuss the national rail crisis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	47	I would like formally to object to the proposal for the Dáil to rise until 7 November. The House has only sat for six weeks since the beginning of this session.There is a lot of legislation, as we have said, to the Government mid-term and the summer. This includes the Technological Universities Bill and the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. I take it that it is not the fault of the Oireachtas but it has not yet been produced by Government. However, I think it is excessive. That is my genuine view and I have been saying it to Deputies for quite some time. The Dáil should reconvene on Wednesday, 1 November and Thursday, 2 November, which used to be a normal occurrence after bank holiday weekends. It seems to me that there is a tendency for the Dáil to sit less and less as we go on. There may be a reason for that and Government may acquiesce in it for its reasons. We have a lot of work to do and we are not going to get it all done if it is to be sandwiched in on Wednesdays and Thursdays every week.

Let me make it clear that the Business Committee discussed the matter, that reservations were expressed about the Hallowe'en break, that agreement was reached by a majority of members of the Business Committee and that a calendar was produced. The intention was that the Members and staff of the Houses would know well in advance the schedule of work until Christmas. That was what was done.

I put on the record our appreciation of the work of the officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They have long-standing experience in difficult situations such as this one and their work needs to be acknowledged, as well as that of the Ministers and the Members of this House, as led by the Ceann Comhairle. It is important to note that at times we do not recognise the professionalism of those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when dealing with such difficult issues.

A Government spokesperson in the Seanad wrongly accused this party of delaying it, which is an untrue statement. I have been pushing for this since the summer and we have indicated our support for the legislation. I am told by my colleagues in the Seanad, however, that they are told it will be dealt with this month, then next month and now that it will be another week or two before it will be presented. Will the Minister confirm when the Bill will be re-entered, if one likes, to the Seanad and the Oireachtas process?

This has been a long-running problem for the Department to work on with the Halawa family and their legal team. It is great to see its happy ending today.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	82	My question revolves around a commitment in the programme for Government, on page 5, to enhance the lives of those with disabilities. Lewis Harte is from Castlebar, County Mayo. He suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is a very serious life-limiting condition affecting a very small number of boys in Ireland. Lewis will turn six on 2 November, next Thursday. He is mobile, and he is full of fun. He is a gorgeous little boy but all of this will change in a matter of months if he is not granted access to the drug Translarna. The drug is available in 22 European countries. Children like Lewis have only a very small window of opportunity within which the drug is effective and the clock is ticking for Lewis. Another boy, three year old Cathal, is in the same position. Both of these children risk losing their ambulatory capacity; in other words, they will not be able to walk. The Health Service Executive, HSE, has consistently denied children access to Translarna, the drug they desperately need. I am appealing for common sense, goodwill and decency to prevail in this case. Can the Minister give us some assurance that decency will prevail?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	83	I will give the Deputy an assurance that I will raise it with the Minister. The Deputy knows how decisions are made on approval for drugs. I know the issue has been raised many times in this House that drugs that treat very rare conditions are sometimes in a different category. This is the first time I have heard of this particular six year old. I will raise it with the Minister for Health and respond to the Deputy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	84	I join others in warmly welcoming the release of Ibrahim Halawa and thank the consular section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassy staff in Cairo. I was very happy to be part of the delegation earlier this year and I am glad that this has come to a happy conclusion. More than two years ago, I published the general scheme of the data sharing and governance Bill, the purpose of which was to streamline the number of occasions on which any individual citizen had to give the same personal information. It was also intended to enshrine in law best practice in data sharing to address some of the concerns of the public that have surfaced again recently. The last time I looked at the legislative agenda it stated that pre-legislative scrutiny had commenced. In fact, pre-legislative scrutiny was finished in July. When will we see the legislation here in the House?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	85	The official position is that it has just finished pre-legislative scrutiny but, even if that happened in July, we do not have an official date for when it will be brought before the House. I will try to get a response for the Deputy.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	86	In respect of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, at lunchtime today there was a very sobering event organised by Alcohol Action Ireland to remind people that the consumption levels of alcohol are on the up again. It outlined in very stark terms the harmful impact drinking has on one in 11 children as a result of parental drinking. It also said that alcohol is implicated in approximately half of all suicides. This year, some 1,000 people in this country will be diagnosed with alcohol-related cancer.It is 600 days since the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was published and started winding its way through the Seanad. By all accounts, the problems in the Seanad are the result of the failure of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to reach a compromise.

Whatever the reason for the interminable delay in the Seanad, I appeal to the Minister to arrange to sit down with the leader of Fianna Fáil, find the reason for this logjam in the Seanad, put their heads together and move this Bill forward so this House can pass it because it is very much needed.

I do not want to call it anything stronger but that is what it is. It was telling me that water was back in places when it was not back until several days later.

My understanding is that there are fewer than 50 houses without water as a result of Storm Ophelia. There were tens of thousands that did not have water at one point. Likewise, in terms of ESB connections, at one point, up to 350,000 households had no power. It is now down to somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000, with most of them in the Cork area. There were co-ordination efforts across government and through Irish Water and ESB Networks. Of course, we will test to make sure we can improve it for the next time if it should happen again but we should recognise the efforts that have been made.

The decision by Coillte to stop buying wood pulp from private operators in the forestry sector sends a very bad signal to the industry. Those operators have no other outlet for their wood pulp. In the context of meeting our climate change targets on biomass, it is completely the wrong signal for a semi-State company to be sending out.

I take the point the Deputy is raising. During my time in a previous Ministry, I got to know Coillte very well. I do not know the strategic reason for its not sourcing wood pulp from private forestry operators, if, in fact, that is the case. I can certainly try to establish why but I do not have any further information today.

The emergency department at Portlaoise hospital, which had almost 40,000 presentations last year, is to be closed according to the report which I have in my possession and which is due to be discussed tomorrow. It is authored by Dr. Susan O'Reilly, the head of the Dublin Midlands hospital group. The numbers attending Portlaoise hospital, including people from south Kildare, Laois and east Offaly, continue to increase. The report is due to be signed off tomorrow. The Minister for Health knows about it because he has had a similar report on his desk for the past 12 months. The full report was supposed to be released in September 2015 but we have not yet seen it. I plead with the Minister to discuss the matter with the Minister for Health this afternoon and to ensure that the report goes into the shredder.

We also have the highest unemployment rate and the lowest educational attainment rates. It is massively important that this issue be resolved. Last week, in response to Teachta Howlin, the House was informed that the legislation has been recommitted to Committee Stage and that amendments will be tabled at the appropriate committee.

The position is that a number of amendments were necessitated by the discussions with various stakeholders. Those amendments are at a very advanced stage in the Attorney General's office.

The basis of the project is that 10% of the funding will be delivered upfront and the remainder will be delivered once the project is complete and handed over. I understand that in the Minister's county of Cork, if a developer is willing to hand over land, 30% upfront funding is made available and this makes the development far more bankable and deliverable. I welcome that. I do not have any problem with it. In the context of procurement guidelines, I asked whether different rules apply to different counties.If so, is that fair and can it be addressed? We cannot have a situation where developers in one county are trying to get something over the line and cannot get the necessary finance for it whereas in other counties they can. I welcome the initiative taken in Cork to allow 30% upfront funding.

I do not know whether the funding initiative, which essentially is what it is, to try to help developers from a cash point of view is unique to Cork or is on the instruction of the Department.

A person who applies for carer's allowance for someone who is terminally ill must wait four months for a decision. Unfortunately, sometimes, that time is not there for the person who wants to receive the carer's allowance because the person is terminally ill and does not have that time to spare. Somebody needs to explain to the Minister that this will have to be expedited. Once the person is terminally ill and once the proper medical evidence is in, the carer's allowance should be granted immediately upon applying for it. It is a very fair and ordinary request.

I take the point the Deputy makes. We clearly cannot stand over it taking four months to make a decision on the care of a person who may not have that time.

A total of 32 people have applied for transfer into this country from prisons abroad. Surely we should be equally anxious for them to come home. They were coming home at a rate of about six a year until there was a difficulty in the courts in 2014. Last year, only one person was repatriated. It is very appropriate to ask this question today. When will the transfer of sentenced persons and transfer of execution of sentences Bill, which has been on the legislation programme for years, come before the Dáil in order to facilitate the repatriation of people incarcerated abroad to our country?

It is important to point out that the case of Ibrahim Halawa was different because we had to wait until it was concluded and there was a verdict. He was found innocent of all charges. Therefore, he is a free man and an innocent man. He is not somebody who is incarcerated and needs to be brought home potentially to serve a sentence in Ireland or anything like that. I can understand why the Deputy is raising it today and it is a fair point.It is important to emphasise that, in the Halawa case, Ibrahim was found innocent of all charges and, as result of that, he has travelled home as a free man with an Irish passport.

Many businesses and small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are depending on the Bill that will deal with them coming before the House. Local authorities will be given the power to reduce their rates. I come from Dundalk, where many small businesses are struggling to cope with the cost of rents, rates, insurance and other expenses. This is a very important issue. In his previous role as Minister with responsibility for the environment, the Minister pushed very hard in this respect. Can he advise what is happening with respect to commercial rates?

It will essentially modernise our rates legislation that dates back to the 1920s. It will allow local authorities to have more autonomy in terms of altering those rates up and down in a way that can drive commercial activity into certain parts of certain counties and cities. This legislation is badly needed. The sooner we can co-operate with other parties to bring it forward, the better.

Today I wish to introduce to the House my Contempt of Court Bill 2017. Contempt of court is the means by which our justice system ensures the smooth running and operating of the courts. Contempt of court underpins the functions of our justice system. It helps to ensure our courts operate fairly, effectively and efficiently. It is designed to prevent injustices from being done, to protect the administration of justice and to guarantee the right of every citizen to receive a fair and impartial hearing of his or her case. These powers are used by courts the world over in both civil and criminal cases and have been used by our courts since before the foundation of the State. The law of contempt developed at common law to allow the administration of justice to operate without undue obstruction or interference. It also helps maintain public confidence in the justice system. I am bringing forward this Bill both because contempt of court should be put on a statutory footing and because the courts need new powers to deal with new problems. As long ago as 1994, the Law Reform Commission first sought contempt of court to be put on a statutory legislative basis. Although contempt of court exists at common law, it has never been put on a statutory footing until now. The Supreme Court first called for changes in this law in the early 1990s. Legislation was introduced in our neighbouring jurisdiction in the UK in 1981 and has since been introduced in a great many other countries throughout the world. It is time, therefore, that the law of contempt in this jurisdiction was modernised and clarified. The most important part of the Bill is the section that deals with criminal contempt. Criminal contempt is contempt which is calculated to prejudice the course of justice. This includes disruptive behaviour in courts, failing to answer subpoenas or scandalising the court. This Bill will give courts the power to deal with criminal contempt on a summary basis, subject to certain restrictions. This means that, in practice, if someone is disruptive in court, the court can deal with them there and then in the here and now. These powers have been used by the courts for some time to tackle these problems. However, they need to be clarified and put on a statutory basis. Where a person publishes prejudicial material about a pending court case, this is known as sub judice contempt and with new online communication platforms being available to all, the risk of contempt is much greater. Criminal contempt, however, is not the only type of contempt. Civil contempt is a failure to abide by court orders. There would be no point in having a court system if people were able to get away with not obeying the decisions of the courts. This only applies to conduct which has already taken place, not to future conduct. The Supreme Court has referenced the fact that the lines between criminal contempt and civil contempt are blurred. If there is confusion as to whether a contempt is civil or criminal, this Bill clarifies that it is for the judge, himself or herself, to decide. Putting both types of contempt on a statutory basis leaves less room for challenge and stops questions to the effect that our contempt of court laws may run contrary to the Constitution or to the European Convention on Human Rights. The most innovative part of the Bill is the powers it gives courts to deal with contempts of court that occur on social media. We live in the era of fake news. The reality is that contemptuous material can be posted from anywhere on the globe and be seen by thousands in a matter of seconds. The former Chief Justice, Susan Denham, stated last June that our laws were inadequate in this regard. Other judges and the Attorney General of the UK, Jeremy Wright, have made similar comments. Why is it that inaccurate comments or posts on social media that are viewed and shared thousands of times are not treated in the same way as publications on other media? The potential impact on juries is incalculable. We do not know what material they or the judges see. The courts system needs the powers to deal with social media and online publications. This Bill will give the courts the power to direct that posts be removed or not posted by way of suppression or take-down orders. If necessary, court orders may be made to social media providers and the consequential repercussions made of not abiding by these orders. This Bill is about respecting the integrity of our justice system in a new era. The law reform commission of New Zealand has called for similar powers in its recent recommendations. This is about the justice system adapting to changes in technology while still ensuring the right to a fair trial. This Bill protects the delicate balance between the right to free speech and the right to a fair trial. It is important to note that the Bill introduces a number of defences that will ensure that the laws on contempt are not used to censor free speech or to silence proper commentary. Innocent publications or good faith comments on public affairs will not be criminalised. The Bill also gives additional protection by giving the ability to appeal findings of contempt.  On the topic of jurors, the jury is one of the cornerstones, as we know, of our justice system. My Bill introduces powers to deal with contempt of court by members of juries. If jurors act in an inappropriate manner or fail to disclose any connection they may have to a case, then this would be dealt with. This is to ensure that juries remain independent and impartial and thereby ensure that justice is done.  This Bill also removes the old offences of maintenance and champerty. These are an old form of contempt relating to how court cases are funded but neither offence has been prosecuted here for more than a century. They have been abolished completely in most other countries and they remain as torts or civil wrongs.  In short, this Bill modernises the law of contempt in Ireland and introduces new powers that would allow our courts deal with ever-changing technology. It includes important measures to ensure that the rights of those affected are upheld, particularly the right to freedom of speech. It ensures that Irish courts are some of the most modem in the world and are well equipped to deal with any problems the future may throw at them. It also for the first time puts the onus on social media platforms and other online sites to take some vicarious responsibility and accountability for comments made online that may have an intended or unintended prejudice towards the outcome of a criminal trial.Irish legislation must keep up to date. Above all, we must ensure the protection of our justice system and, in light of new communications, that everyone receives a fair trial. I commend my Bill to the House.

Can he give a commitment that there will be accountability as to how this happened in the first place and that there will be a thorough investigation that gets to the bottom of how exactly this could occur?

I have just concluded my meetings with the CEOs of Bank of Ireland, AIB, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank and KBC to discuss the tracker mortgage examination. The Government and I are not satisfied with the progress lenders have made to date, and believe that impacted customers should by this time have had their tracker mortgages restored and, where appropriate, have received redress and compensation. The Central Bank published an update on the tracker examination on 17 October. As part of this update, the bank released details of its engagement with lenders thus far and the enforcement actions the Central Bank has so far taken. As Deputies will be aware, the Central Bank has already concluded an enforcement investigation in respect of tracker mortgage-related failures identified at Springboard Mortgages Limited, and in that instance it imposed a monetary penalty of €4.5 million on Springboard. Currently, the Central Bank is pursuing investigations into tracker mortgage-related issues arising in both Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank Ireland. Two further enforcement investigations into other lenders are in train, and in its recent appearance before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public, Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the Central Bank indicated that further enforcement investigations can be anticipated. The Central Bank has statutory reporting obligations to An Garda Síochána and other agencies where it suspects a criminal offence may have been committed by a supervised entity. The Central Bank takes these obligations very seriously and complies with them on an ongoing basis as appropriate. However, decisions in respect of this are solely a matter for the Central Bank, independent criminal investigation bodies and prosecution authorities. Nevertheless, I would strongly support the Central Bank's pursuit of its tracker mortgage-related investigations and any other necessary actions to the fullest extent and as expeditiously as possible. However, let me be very clear on this matter. I believe that impacted tracker mortgage borrowers have been treated disgracefully by mortgage lenders, and that many borrowers have incurred considerable losses and in some cases even more significant harm. We should be clear that it was the mortgage lenders that caused this harm to their customers and that the primary responsibility for rectifying the problem rests with them. Therefore, all lenders need to bring the Central Bank examination to a conclusion without any further delay, and to do so to the satisfaction of the Central Bank and more particularly to the satisfaction of their impacted customers. The main point I want to make now is that the time has arrived for banks to finally act in the best interest of their impacted mortgage customers. Of course, they should have done this from the beginning.  The meetings have now concluded with the banks.  I will have more contact with them over the course of the day and when this has concluded I will update the House during Private Members' business tomorrow evening.

We know that 10,000 customers have not got the money back that was wrongly taken from them, not to mention any compensation from their lenders. There may well be many more. It is certainly not the case since this emerged that the banks have dealt with it in an open, honest or transparent manner. Any independent reading of the Central Bank report last week will tell us that the banks had to be dragged kicking and screaming through this process. They tried to minimise the amount of compensation. They did not declare all the customers who were actually affected. I will repeat my two questions. Can the Minister give a categoric commitment to everyone caught up in this that they will get justice? Can he give a straight answer as to whether there will be accountability on how this could happen in the first place?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	163	I will echo some of the comments Deputy Michael McGrath has made. Let us put this into context. We use all these words about redress and examination and all the rest. The banks, some of which are State-owned and in some of which the State is the majority shareholder, are holding on to customers' moneys unlawfully. There are 10,000 that we know of and there may be many more thousands on top of that figure. The quantum of money the banks are holding unlawfully at this point, which they have taken from their customers, is in the region of €300 million. Finally, the Government seems to have woken up and the Minister has brought the banks in to give them a dressing down. Nine months ago, I was challenging the Minister to do just that. What we need now is clarity. Is there going to be individual accountability? This Dáil spoke with one voice in January of this year, when Sinn Féin used its Private Members' time to propose that the Government put forward any such legislation identified as being necessary as a result of the examination to ensure that individuals and financial institutions can be held accountable for any white-collar crime that may have occurred. Has the Government carried out any examination? Can the Minister give a guarantee to those who are watching out there, the victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, that they will receive their money back into their accounts before the end of this year and that they will receive adequate compensation?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	164	In respect of the desire of the House to see accountability for how our citizens have been disgracefully treated in this matter, I remind Deputies that I made the point a moment ago that the Central Bank has already imposed a fine on Springboard in respect of this and other matters. It is my strong view that the manner in which banks have handled the probe for the Central Bank, and the recent behaviour of the banks in the management of this issue are unacceptable. It shines a light not only on the culture of our banking system at the time this issue originated, but also on the culture of our banking system now. Neither is acceptable to me.I am supporting the Central Bank in its work around the probe. I believe that all who are owed money should have it repaid to them and I am supporting the Central Bank in this regard. In regard to accountability and the outcome of this process, which Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty have raised with me, enforcement proceedings are already under way by the Central Bank in respect of two banks. This shows the determination of the Central Bank to move this matter to closure. I encourage the Central Bank to use all the powers available to it in regard to this issue, as I believe it will do. I met the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, yesterday, to discuss this issue. I am confident that all of the powers that are available to the Central Bank will be used if the latter stages of its probe vindicates their use and if the bank can stand over conclusions that emerge from it, which I believe it will be able to do. In regard to the issues raised by both Deputies today, my message is that the people who are owed money should have it repaid to them. They have been treated disgracefully by our banks in the latter part of this probe and I want to see that changed.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	165	I respect the independence of the Central Bank but fines are not the answer. Springboard Mortgages has come through this process with only a fine of over €4 million. If the outcome in respect of the other banks that are some way through this process is fines, they will be passed on to customers and this will happen again because there will have been no accountability. Springboard Mortgages has concluded the process and there has been no accountability whatsoever in terms of how this happened and who was responsible. If that is a taste of what is to come, we are going nowhere. What people want to know is when this nightmare will be over. We know that in respect of up to 10,000 customers, the banks are still sitting on their money. They have not repaid them or given them compensation. Did the Minister get a commitment from the banks as to when all of the customers who have been identified, not to mention the many others who we suspect are also involved, will actually get their money back? That is the first step. I do not think it is too much to expect banks to give people back their own money.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	166	The Minister's response if this was day one of this scandal might be appropriate but it was in 2010 that the Central Bank wrote to the banks about the tracker mortgage issue and it was in 2015 that this examination came to light. Two years ago, the Central Bank allowed the banks an additional year to come up with the final figures and yet in October 2017 we still do not have those figures. The Minister said that his message is that people should have the money returned to them. In regard to the banks in which the Government is a majority shareholder, did the Minister instruct them to return the money immediately - it was unlawfully taken and should be put back into customer's accounts immediately - and did he tell them that if they did not do so he would sack the boards of those banks, Permanent TSB and Allied Irish Banks, AIB and that he would not support the re-appointment of the CEO of the Bank of Ireland? Did the Minister tell the banks that he would use his powers to appoint real public interest directors to the boards of banks that were subject to the guarantee in 2008? Did he ever telephone any of the public interest directors and ask them what they had been doing on the boards for the past two years as the banks were dragging their feet? What we need is clear deadlines. We want to know if the money will be back in individuals' accounts before the end of this year. In regard to the motion brought forward by Sinn Féin on 24 January this year, to which the Government's response was that it would bring forward legislation on individual accountability, what has the Government done in regard to individual accountability in the banks, because this scandal will reoccur in a different form in years to come if we do not do that now?

The hurt and harm that has been caused to citizens as a result of the manner in which the banks have handled this issue is not acceptable to me as Minister for Finance and as a shareholder in a number of these banks. I have heard much talk of cohorts and consumer affairs. What I am aware of is the hurt that has been caused to citizens in our State in terms of how this matter has been recently dealt with. The Central Bank has made use of the powers available to it under the legislation brought in by the previous Government in 2013 to deal with this issue. The Central Bank has been using all of the tools available to it to resolve this issue. I am supporting it in its work to bring this issue to a conclusion. Too many people are waiting for their money to be repaid. Too much confusion still exists in regard to where stands this issue. In the engagements I have had with the banks on this matter, I have made clear to them that this is a disgrace. This matter should have been resolved by now. I will use the influence open to me as Minister for Finance to bring clarity to this issue in the coming days. I will update the House at the first opportunity available to me to do so, which I expect will be the Private Members' motion tomorrow evening.

Irish officials and experts have been engaged in intensive work to ensure that the State complies with all its recovery obligations as soon as possible and they have been in constant contact with the European Commission and Apple on all aspects of this process for over a year. We have made significant progress on the complex issue of establishing an escrow fund. Given the scale and bespoke nature of such a fund, the precise terms are subject to confidential and commercially sensitive deliberations and I cannot at this point be drawn into a public commitment on timeframes as this could undermine the State's position, save to say that it will take place as soon as possible. The announcement of the intention to launch infringement proceedings against Ireland is a wholly unnecessary step by the Commission. No fines will accrue to Ireland on foot of infringement proceedings under Article 108(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Assuming the Commission can successfully convince the European Court of Justice that Ireland has not made sufficient progress on recovery, the result will be a declaration from the court that Ireland has not complied with its treaty obligations.  The Government takes this very seriously and we will do everything in our power to defend such action. Fines may occur on foot of a second court action taken by the Commission for Ireland’s failure to have complied with a judgment of the European Court of Justice under Article 260(2) of the treaty. The level of fines is at the discretion of the court and the purpose behind them is to ensure that member states take their treaty obligations seriously. The Government has made clear that we respect the rule of law in the European Union and we will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that the need for such action and the levelling of such fines does not arise.

I do not understate that there are many complexities involved. It is not a case of simply exchanging bank account details and money being transferred. However, in delaying this process the Government has given ammunition to those who seek to target Ireland in regard to corporation tax. The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, proposals have been refloated by the European Commission, along with proposals to tax digital companies based on turnover, and President Juncker has been talking about removing the veto in regard to corporation tax matters. These are very serious issues. The key issue is that by not meeting the European Commission's deadline for collecting the money from Apple we have provided those who seek to target us with unnecessary ammunition. I do not understand why the Minister will not say when he expects the money to be paid over. The money should be collected by Ireland pending the outcome of the appeal. Fianna Fáil supports the Government's appeal but respects the decision that was made and the money should be collected pending the appeal. Why can the Minister not say when that will be done? Can he update the House on the sum of money involved?

In terms of relevant timeframes, it has previously been the case that when a member state has co-operated in good faith with an understanding or direction from the Commission, the Commission will actively engage with the member state for at least two years before initiating proceedings in that regard. The Government sought an extension from the Commission to deal with this matter but it was not granted. One reason the negotiations are so sensitive is the amount of money involved. When the fund is set up, as it will be, it will be one of the largest of its kind in the world. The fine is the largest of its kind that a government or company has had to deal with. Because of the complexity of the matter and because the Commission has indicated that other jurisdictions might be able to access the money in the future, before the money can be received we must have a very comprehensive agreement in place in respect of the operation of the escrow account. To have the fund set up, the Government had to go through several procurement processes to ensure compliance with European Union law. That has all taken time and that is the reason I regret the action taken by the European Commission on the issue.

There was a deadline of early January 2017 for the collection of the money. I do not recall the Government saying that was wholly unrealistic, which now seems to be the Minister's central point. He accuses the Commission of bad faith and says that countries would normally get two years following a ruling such as this to collect the money but the Commission has instead initiated infringement proceedings. The Minister is giving further ammunition to the Commission by not even laying out a roadmap for the collection of the money. There are tendering procedures involved. Tendering started in July in regard to the NTMA, as I understand it. Can the Minister provide the House with an estimate of when the decision will be respected in terms of the collection of the money and it being put into an escrow account on a temporary basis pending the appeal?

One of the reasons I cannot publicly indicate the likely point at which it will be concluded is we are having discussions and negotiations with a company in this regard and those have to conclude in a manner satisfactory for both parties. I aim to conclude the process as soon as possible, collect the money and, while the money is collected and deposited in an escrow account, continue with the action that Ireland needs to take to defend its name in respect of this issue.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	177	I wish to ask the Minister about the extensive leaking in the days before the budget of his intention to raise significantly the rate of stamp duty from 2% and, potentially, to double it. Such leaks have never been as blatant or widespread as in the run-up to budget 2018 and certain individuals may have been in a position to profit very significantly from them.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	178	In 2011 the rate of stamp duty applying to non-residential property transactions was fixed at a flat rate of 2% as a supply-side measure. Budget 2018 increased the rate on such property transactions to 6% as of 11 October 2017. While the commercial property market has now recovered strongly, the recent sharp increase in investment in construction activity poses a risk that this could, if left unchecked, give rise to overheating in the sector and in the domestic economy generally. This view is shared by commentators including the ESRI. Investment in non-residential construction has expanded rapidly over recent years and is approaching its pre-crisis share of gross national income (Star), GNI*. I am acutely aware that residential construction and the overall housing supply remain well below the level needed to meet demand. With the commercial market now performing strongly, an adjustment in the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property beyond the current rate of 2% is appropriate. The yield from the increased rate is estimated to be approximately €370 million. In addition to providing additional yield, the increase to 6% should support the desired re-balancing of construction activity towards residential investment and help to address potential overheating in the sector. I am aware of views that we have over-estimated the potential yield from the stamp duty increase. However, those views appear to be based on the additional yield from commercial property developments only, whereas the stamp duty increase I announced applies to the whole of the non-residential property market. As regards the Deputy's concern about the perceived leaking of this budget decision, I assure her that I played no part in creating an environment in which my decision could be leaked. Speculation was rife on what I was going to do in regard to this measure and several others because they were contained in tax strategy group papers published last summer. A point was reached in the budgetary process at which commentary appeared to be pointing to how few leaks were occurring and all decisions in relation to taxation were treated very sensitively and carefully by me.

Such reports were carried by practically all of the major national newspapers and organisations such as BreakingNews.ie. That meant that if commercial property owners had their transactions ready, they could save considerable sums of money by moving and completing the transactions during the 48 hours before the budget. The sources of the leak were clearly within the Department of Finance because the leaks were very specific and their accuracy was confirmed when the Minister read out the budget. This is a bad policy because it has allowed some very large property transactions to escape the tax. If this is to be the standard set by the Minister in charge of the budget, it is extremely disappointing and costly for the taxpayer.

Because she agrees with the decision I made, she can do nothing beyond making unfounded and inaccurate allegations regarding my conduct and that of my Department. The decision on this matter was treated with the utmost sensitivity by my officials and me. During the time period to which the Deputy refers, many other assertions were made regarding what would happen on budget day, the majority of which proved unfounded.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	181	If the Minister is that concerned, he has a very easy remedy that would put all our minds at rest, namely, backdate the introduction of the measures to 8, 9 or 10 October. The budget was brought in on 11 October. If he wanted to, the Minister could even backdate the introduction of the measures to 1 October. It is a fundamental principle of fairness in taxation that those in the know should not have access to privileged information which would allow them, as in this case, to mitigate significantly the likely amount of stamp duty they would have to pay. In addition, subsequent to the budget, fairly respected commentators suggested that the target would not be reached, partially, I suspect, because of the leaking, and that people in the business of tax arrangements and tax avoidance were able, therefore, to anticipate what the Minister would do. That was foolish from the Department's point of view. There were suggestions that the actual yield from the tax will not be what the Minister indicated in his budget speech. Obviously, we will discover the actual position over the coming year.

If, in the context of this measure, the best she can do is infer that I or my Department engaged in behaviour for which she has no evidence whatsoever, it points to the poverty of ideas she and the Labour Party are offering regarding our economy and how all of us want to move it forward. This is the right policy measure to put in place. The Government made the correct decision in terms of broadening the tax base. Given the Deputy's background and what I understood to be the policy of the Labour Party, I would have thought that they would support this. If the best the Deputy can do is allege that I was involved in behaviour that would allow some to benefit from decisions I make, she has a very poor grasp of the standards I and my Department try to stand by when we are involved in the development and implementation of policy. The Deputy's comments are unfounded and a slur on the quality of the officials in my Department, who have helped me draft and implement policy options. The Deputy should know - I suspect she does but is not willing to make the point because she is seeking political gain - that at no point would I be involved in seeking to bestow a benefit on anyone as a result of a decision that could be made on budget day. It ill behoves the Deputy to suggest otherwise.

I think everyone in the House accepts that finance is an essential ingredient in delivering the homes we want to build for our people throughout the country. Specifically, when does the Minister anticipate the fund to be up and running and providing finance for home construction? Will the terms and conditions be on a commercial basis and attractive enough that the loans will actually be drawn down and used?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	195	As announced in my budget day speech on 10 October 2017, it is my intention to establish HBFI to provide funding on market terms to viable residential development projects whose owners are experiencing difficulty obtaining debt funding or credit. HBFI will be a stand-alone entity that will provide funding directly into the market. It will be designed to leverage off the extensive expertise already available to the State to deliver this initiative and, as such, existing NAMA staff skills and expertise will be utilised to deliver the funding involved. Any lending provided in due course will be made available by HBFI and will not impact on NAMA's existing objectives or its board's strategic wind-down plans. In answer to the Deputy's final question, I hope to bring the establishing legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval either later this year or in early 2018, with a view to HBFI commencing operations by the second quarter of next year. It is not expected that it will have an indefinite lifespan but it is too early to speculate as to how long it might operate as this will depend on the availability of funding in the market to meet demand for homes in the coming years.

One of the reasons the Activate Capital fund has not been hugely successful is that the initial cost of funding was very high. I think it was as high as 14% but has come down significantly since then. The fund has had some success but not, I think, at a level others might have expected. Will the Minister clarify what will be the terms and conditions associated with the funding that this new body will provide? Will he confirm that the legislation is under preparation and that he will bring it before the House on schedule?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	197	The legislation is under preparation and I am confident that I will be in a position to publish it towards the end of this year and bring it before the House in the early part of next year. Regarding the terms and conditions relating to the credit and how it would be made available to companies, it must and will be made available on commercial and market-equivalent terms. In other words, the way in which this funding will be provided must be consistent with the commercial terms upon which funding is provided elsewhere in the market. I have studied the operation of the Activate Capital fund, the success of which to date has shown that there is a need for credit in a way that our banks are not able to facilitate at present. As I bring the legislation before the House, I am confident we will be able to create an entity that will be able to do this. At this point, I am not in a position to be able to comment on what the rate of interest will be because much of that will depend on the quality of the individual applications made to HBFI once it is set up.

What role, if any, will it have in the construction of social or affordable housing? For example, will approved housing bodies be able to avail of funding from this new organisation for the construction of voluntary housing association houses or social houses that they will be delivering as part of schemes?

The rationale behind this thinking is that in dealing with approved housing bodies and local authorities, my experience is that the issue they face is not the rate of interest on the credit they need. In many cases the funding they need is provided directly by the Exchequer. For this reason, my current thinking is that HBFI will be primarily focused on the private sector. However, in the course of the Bill's passage through the House, if Members have suggestions as to how this might be amended or if it needs wider breadth to deal with the long-term objective of increasing housing supply, I will be open to dealing with Deputy Michael McGrath and others on that point.

I want to pre-empt the question by saying I fully support the arts industry and the attempt to increase the production of film and create jobs. However, there is a problem with what is known as section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. I ask the Minister to make a statement on the review of that measure, what he thinks of it and whether we can have proper oversight of it.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	202	Prior to 2015, film relief took the form of an investor tax relief which provided an incentive to individual and corporate taxpayers to invest in Irish film production. The relief was granted by way of a deduction from total income of the amount invested for the year of assessment in which the qualifying film investment was made. The Finance Act 2013 amended the scheme such that, rather than providing relief to investors, instead, from 1 January 2015, a payable tax credit of 32% is payable directly to a producer company.  The tax credit reduces the corporation tax liability of the producer company in that period.  Where the tax credit exceeds the tax due for the qualifying period, the tax credit will be a payable credit.  The current scheme is due to expire on 31 December 2020. As it concerns tax expenditure, section 481 is subject to the requirements of my Department in regard to tax expenditure guidelines. A full analysis and review of that section will be undertaken prior to any announcement on the extension of the relief and this will be done well in advance of any potential extension beyond 2020. In terms of the operation of the scheme to date, the most up-to-date figures I have available are that the provisional number of claimants of the tax credit in 2015 was 1,102, with a cost to the Exchequer of €69.7 million.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	203	I want to ask about oversight of this tax break. Surely if the State is to dispense such a generous scheme, while I agree with it dispensing generous schemes to encourage the arts and the film industry, should the State not have some oversight of how the scheme is administered? I have evidence that shows widespread abuse of this scheme, and I am sure other Deputies also have such evidence because, when people come to us, they come to many different parties and groups. The abuse is of the workers themselves in the way they are used by the film industry, where very highly trained workers are often taken on as trainees and told there are no other positions available. In this way, the industry uses camera crew, sound men and other types of trained professionals at a very cheap rate. This probably links in to the increased use of precarious, illegitimate and bogus contracts in this country. Employers seem to be finding any scheme possible to undermine workers' rights and I think this scheme is being used in that abuse.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	204	I have a later question from Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett about this general issue and I have some broader figures in regard to the issue raised by Deputy Smith that I will be sharing with him as well. In regard to the two ways in which this scheme is overseen, it is done both at departmental level and then by the Revenue Commissioners. Regarding the work that happens through the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and her Department, applicants can only access this tax relief if they receive a tax certificate from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, having regard to the category of the film and the contribution it will make either to the film industry in the State or the promotion or expression of Irish culture. Therefore, the policy end is overseen by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. In regard to the concerns Deputy Smith has on the protection of employees, the Revenue Commissioners now also have to issue a certificate highlighting how the employer has to comply with particular forms of legislation. The Revenue Commissioners require that if an organisation or a company receives the section 481 approval letter, they must be satisfied the organisation or company is compliant with the law in regard to the taxation Acts, capital gains tax Acts, the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 and all social welfare and pensions Acts.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	205	That all sounds very good but the reality is that some €7 billion has been given to the industry in the past 15 years in tax breaks, which is very generous. Although I do not disagree with that if it is performing the function it set out to perform, which is to give training and to nurture homegrown talent instead of abusing workers' rights, then it is absolutely the right thing to do. However, what we find in reality is that there is a very high degree of abuse of the workers within the industry and, in some cases, tax breaks are being given to companies which do not even film in Ireland, which cannot be legitimate. We need better oversight than what the Minister has described, whereby the Revenue Commissioners demand certain certificates and criteria and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht gets them to sign a form that says this, that or the other, while there is no actual oversight of the administration of the scheme. As we have seen, and the Minister will be discussing this with other Deputies later, there is a gross abuse of workers' rights taking place across all industries at the moment. If one industry does it, they are all going to copy that because they seem to be able to get away with it.

As Minister for Social Protection, I commissioned a study and review which was to be carried out between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance. I cannot for the life of me understand, unless this has been released yesterday or today, why that study has never been published given that it has been available for possibly up to a year. The report was based on submissions, including very detailed submissions by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. If we had the information that is held in that report, we could perhaps identify a way of moving forward in regard to this very difficult issue for workers who are forced to become self-employed when, in fact, they are traditional employees.

For example, in 2016 it was 54 companies in respect of 74 films; and in 2017 up to the end of the first quarter, it was 15 companies in respect of 21 films. I have a list of all of the films or productions that received the grant. If the Deputy has any concern in regard to the employment terms or how that relief is being transferred on the ground, she might make those specific examples available to me and I will certainly share them with either the Revenue Commissioners or the relevant agency. The purpose of this relief is to translate it into cultural activity that delivers good employment and meets the policy objectives I have described. For the information of the House, I understand that across 2015 and 2016 some 3,415 full-time jobs were created in this sector, many of which we attribute to this policy.

This is an essential measure to try to avoid a return to the housing bubble conditions and to bring down the cost of building. It is interesting that the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland said earlier today that the cost of building in Dublin is incredibly high, largely due to high land prices. Will the Department of Finance consider reintroducing such a tax and what would the arguments be against such a measure?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	216	I am advised by Revenue that the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 amended the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by providing for an 80% windfall tax on profits or gains arising from disposals of development land to the extent that those gains were attributable to a relevant planning decision. Section 31 of Finance Act 2014 repealed the 80% tax rate on these profits or gains with effect from 1 January 2015. The impetus for this latter amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 came from the views expressed by various parties in both the private and public sector, with which the Minister for Finance at the time agreed, that the windfall tax provisions were acting and would act as an impediment to land rezoning, land development and redevelopment and to land sales for development. The reintroduction of such a windfall tax on a similar basis is likely to act as a disincentive to landowners to dispose of such property, which could be detrimental to the Government policy to encourage home building. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is developing a new national planning framework, Ireland 2040 Our Plan. It will provide a national planning framework to guide national, regional and local planning and investment decisions for the years ahead, building on and co-ordinating the existing regional and local authority planning processes.

The report found that the lack of such a tax on the profits that accrue from a rezoning decision leads to a tendency to hoard land. Rather than being a disincentive for owners to dispose of land, it is actually an incentive for people to speculate on, store and hoard land. Have we learned nothing from that Kenny report? The legislative provision to which I refer was introduced as a practical way to introduce Mr. Justice Kenny's recommendations. There would have been constitutional difficulties in the context of interfering with property rights but a tax on super-normal profits was a very real and practical way of getting away from the incentive to speculate on or hoard land, which is contributing to increases in the cost of accommodation. Does the Minister disagree with the Kenny report? Does he not think that land hoarding and the whole game regarding land speculation were two of the main causes of the property crisis? Why would the Minister not try to tackle that problem at source?

The hoarding of land and the lack of supply of land, especially the lack of zoned land and the pricing thereof, lies at the heart of many of the difficulties we are now facing in the housing market. I accept much of the analysis the Deputy has offered on this issue. Where I differ with him on the introduction of a so-called windfall tax would be in the context of the point at which the tax liability is calculated when a transaction goes through. My concern is that this would act as an impediment to the release of land to allow more homes to be built. I wish to highlight the measures we have brought in, such as the vacant site levy, and the fact that capital gains tax relating to the type of land we are discussing stands at 33%. I introduced an increase in stamp duty on commercial property in the budget, which is another way of achieving the objective of increasing the availability of land for residential development. It is a concern that bringing in a tax measure of the kind suggested and of such magnitude would actually impede the release of land for the delivery of homes.

Am I right in that interpretation? Is it that it would act as a disincentive? When will the time be right for us to attack this fundamental lack of justice, as well as the rot which lies at the centre of the high-price housing and property bubble instincts that exist in this State? When will be the right time to introduce such a tax? Are we for ever to agree that the profit accruing from a council decision to rezone lands belongs to the landowner and not to society? The Green Party introduced the tax on super-normal profits and, as I recall, the main argument given when it was removed was that it had not raised any revenue. It had not raised revenue because the State was in the middle of a slump. That was the right time to introduce it. If we do not reintroduce something of that nature now when will we do it? Will it be when another bubble develops?

I clearly said that I disagree with the solution the Deputy is proposing. I was clear on that. I disagree because it is my view that bringing in a tax such as that to which the Deputy refers could actually slow the release of land for the development of homes. That is my analysis of the issue. When seeking to ensure that the taxpayer, or the State, benefits from gains that are conferred by zoning decisions, this happens through the use of capital gains tax. This tax is based on the price at which the land is sold. In turn, and as the Deputy is aware, that price is influenced by the zoning decisions to which he refers.

Serious concerns have been raised, especially regarding the transfer of a farm from one generation to the next and the fact that this may be affected by the increase to 6%. I know the Minister has made the announcement in respect of the Finance Bill and I look forward to the debate on that later.

In my Budget Statement, I announced an increase in the stamp duty rate for all non-residential property transactions, including those relating to agricultural land, from 2% to 6%. On the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I also announced an extension of consanguinity relief for another three years and that the stamp duty rate applying under that scheme would be fixed at 1%. Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members. It encourages the early transfer of farms to younger generations and is mostly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief, such as the young trained farmer stamp duty exemption. In the aftermath of the Budget Statement, I received correspondence from farming interests regarding a number of issues, including stamp duty. I have decided that in addition to extending the period of the relief and fixing the associated stamp duty rate at 1%, the age rule for the consanguinity relief will be removed. This means that it will be possible for all gifts and sales of farmlands to closely related family members who do not qualify for the 100% exemption available under the young trained farmer scheme to benefit from consanguinity relief at a stamp duty rate of 1%. The question of an age limit will be revisited when the measure comes up for review towards the end of 2020. The young trained farmer relief scheme will not be affected by the stamp duty rate change because it provides for a full stamp duty exemption where the qualifying criteria are met.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	I thank the Minister for his reply. The issue raised is quite unusual. We had the announcement on budget day and the following day the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, informed us that the increase was not going to apply to farmland. We all said "Fine, great, it is not going to apply to farmland". It turns out that the Minister was mistaken and that the increase applies to farmland. The Minister for Finance says that the measure is to encourage the transfer of land early in the career of the farmer rather than waiting for him or her to reach his or her 80s or 90s.That is what was encouraged but now the Government has changed the policy and will allow people to live to 100 while keeping the land. The day before they pass on to the Lord, they can transfer the land back without any stamp duty being imposed. The very policy the Government set out to achieve has now been turned on its head. I stand to be corrected, but it suggests it was not thought through in the first place. That is the first issue. The main issue here and what my question really relates to is the following. While I accept the issue about young farmers and qualified farmers, I spoke to a man yesterday evening who is milking 65 cows and who wants to buy 40 acres of land beside his farm. To buy that land he will now have to pay 6% stamp duty. He gets up early in the morning and works very hard, pays his taxes and produces the goods. I listened to the exchanges earlier and I ask the Minister to look at what he is doing for society compared to Apple with its tax deal and the banks, which pay no tax on their profits. It seems totally unfair. I ask the Minister to address that particular point.

I assure the Deputy that when I made the decision, I was fully aware, as with any decision, of all of the consequences of what I was putting to the Dáil on budget night. I accept that it causes difficulty, concern and increased cost for people, but at 2% the rate was unsustainably low. If we cannot use periods like the present to change rates like this, the tax base will continue to be too narrow. That is why this decision has been made. It is my understanding that the Sinn Féin budget proposal included a proposed change to stamp duty on commercial property. The party was proposing what we did on budget day.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	That was for commercial property, not agricultural land.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	The Deputy will have been as aware as I am of the definition of "commercial property". In putting the point to me about relief, he neglected to state that we have brought the relief in at 1% with no age limit for the next three years and that at the end of three years, we will revert to an age limit. The way in which we are looking to maintain the incentive is by having this window in place for three years only. At the end of the three year period, it will revert to an age limit fixed by the Minister of the day. I did that in recognition of the concerns raised with me in relation to the integrity of the family farm. A measure like this was justified, which is why it is included in the Finance Bill.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	229	The Minister fails to accept the gravity of the situation. The average farm income in this country is half the average industrial wage, which is the issue here. Farmers are struggling to survive. In many cases and where they depend on the farm alone, the only way to survive is by expanding. To expand, they must buy land beside them. This aspect is recognised and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine raised the issue with the Minister for Finance. It is clear that he said it was not just for the young farmer or where a farm was in a family, but it is also an issue for the person who wants to expand his or her holding. There are all kinds of schemes in place, including TAMS, to assist farmers in that regard, yet the Government comes back and takes away with the other hand. It smacks of something that was not thought through.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	230	I echo my colleague's points. Agricultural land should be exempt as proposed in the amendment we supported on budget night when the resolutions went through. I wish to refer to a tangential issue relating to this by which many individuals may be caught. Certainly, I am aware of one person who purchased a large quantity of land to ensure a farm was commercially viable. The last transaction went through on budget night and an invoice was generated by Revenue for 6% stamp duty. The individual does not have the additional €10,000 or €11,000 to pay the 6% rate. As the deal was concluded before 31 March, the family will be charged 2%, but they have to pay it now and there will be a late penalty if they do not. I ask the Minister to speak to Revenue to ensure there are no late penalties for individuals who have purchased land and face a 6% levy until the Finance Bill goes through. It is really important so that people are not in default of their tax liabilities. They have only four weeks to pay that tax liability. It is important for people who entered into genuine transactions and are now caught out because it is not possible to get a loan to cover the additional 4%.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	I welcome the change from the budget day announcement with the publication of the Finance Bill. There are farmers who had not transferred farms to the younger generation prior to age 67 and so had failed to avail of the consanguinity relief. They have now been provided with the opportunity to have the transfer go through at the 1% rate, which will hopefully happen. A related point is that there is a CGT exemption for the sale of certain farmland where the proceeds are used to acquire other farmland for the purposes of consolidating the overall farm land holding. In those limited circumstances where the CGT exemption applies, will the Minister consider applying an exemption to the stamp duty increase also?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	232	Regarding Deputy Martin Kenny's points, I am well aware of the gravity of any decision that I make on taxation. I am crystal clear about it. I go back to the broad point that this rate of 2% was one third of what it had been a number of years ago. If we fail to use periods like this to bring rates like that back to a more sustainable level, we create the seeds of a tax system that is unable to cope with difficulty in the future. That is why I made this change. I ask Deputy Doherty to give me the details of the individual to whom he referred. I will look into the matter on his behalf. It is our clear intention that anyone who has signed a contract for a land transaction avails of the 2% rate. If the Deputy has a concern about an individual transaction, I ask him to share it with me so that I can look into it and ensure it is dealt with correctly from a policy point of view. I am sure the Revenue Commissioners will be aware of it too. Deputy McGrath referred to farm consolidation. There is a capital gains tax for that particular area where transactions take place to consolidate farms. I have not looked at the issue to date because the overwhelming number of the contacts I received related to the provision of clarity on the applicable stamp duty rate where contracts are already signed and the consanguinity issue, which I have dealt with in the Finance Bill.

Our objective, which we share with Government, is that there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. However, I want to ask the Minister about the work of Revenue, whose representatives were before the finance committee in May. At the committee, they gave extensive evidence on the advance or preparatory work being done. I seek an update on that in light of recent political developments.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	234	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 15, 40 and 73 together. Like all Government agencies, Revenue is actively engaged in examining a range of scenarios in order to support Ireland's objectives. This work is being undertaken within a whole-of-Government framework led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While the precise customs arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK, it is clear that political solutions must be found before technical resolutions can be applied. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible, at this juncture, to assess what specific arrangements would be required if the UK left the customs union or what post-Brexit checks would be carried out. The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has previously confirmed that Revenue is not looking for sites for customs posts.In respect of the Revenue report referred to, I am advised that this was a draft working document that was subsequently published on Revenue's website on 11 October 2017. The paper was a preliminary analysis compiled internally by Revenue in September 2016 to support its scenario examination and deliberative process following the UK vote in June 2016 to exit the EU. However, it is important to note that matters have moved on significantly since then and, in particular, since Article 50 was triggered. As such, this document remains in draft form and was not finalised as it was overtaken by consequent major developments and policy statements and does not reflect Revenue's current view on Brexit. Their current view was set out clearly in the chairman’s opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 25 May 2017. The Government's priorities in respect of the unique concerns that arise for Ireland are very clear - to maintain the common travel area and to protect the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including avoiding a hard border. The Government welcomes that these priorities have been reflected in the EU's negotiating position and further welcomes and supports the task force's paper, Guiding Principles on the Dialogue for Ireland-Northern Ireland, which was published on 7 September. The paper builds on the European Council guidelines and reflects the priority Irish issues identified by the Government, including that, in view of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border, including any physical border infrastructure. This must be achieved in a way which ensures that Ireland's place within the Internal Market and customs union is unaffected. The paper also makes it clear that it is the UK's responsibility to propose workable solutions in this regard. It is the Government's view that the UK staying in the customs union and Single Market, or as close as possible to that, would be the best solution. However, it is important that internal analysis continues in the meantime. Several helpful reports and working papers have been published by the ESRI, InterTradeIreland and business representative bodies. Most recently, my Department and Revenue co-sponsored an ESRI study, working paper 573, on Ireland's international trade and transport connections, which was published on Thursday, 12 October 2017.

The Minister mentioned that a great deal of other internal work is being done by ESRI, InterTradeIreland, and business organisations. Are we to believe that the Revenue Commissioners have stopped all contingency scoping exercises relating to different potential Brexit scenarios? Is it the case that Revenue has not undertaken any scoping measures since the draft report, which is quite old? Did the Minister's predecessor or his Department intervene with the Revenue to leave the report as is because at the time it was leaked, we had the commissioners before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, as well as the former Minister for Finance who denied any knowledge of this type of scoping activity? Were instructions given to the Revenue Commissioners? Is the Minister telling us that no scoping exercise is being done to address different Brexit scenarios from a Revenue and a customs point of view?

The issue is on the EU side because if the UK leaves the customs union, which looks increasingly certain, there will be an obligation on the EU to protect the integrity of that union and the Revenue will be the national agent of the European Commission. It is a European Commission competence. The Minister needs to answer the question. If the UK leaves the customs union, which looks increasingly certain, what are we looking at in respect of Border arrangements? There has been some change in the Revenue position regarding preparatory work. The Minister needs to clarify whether the Revenue Commissioners are continuing to conduct analysis and contingency work, to examine options, to scale up IT infrastructure and so on because those were the types of issues they put on the record at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in May but there seems to have been a change.

With regard to the Deputy's statement about the British Government's view of a customs unions, it is crucial that we gain clarity regarding what its customs policy will be. The Government's view is clear. A customs policy that is as close to the current arrangements as is feasible will provide the best framework whereby we do not return to a hard border. This is a key strategic priority of the Government in managing this issue. The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated that they are not involved in any work that will prejudge the outcome of these negotiations because they are political and they are ongoing.

I travelled here from Donegal earlier and I passed through Clady Bridge. I do not want to see customs posts. The House has spoken regarding special status for the North, something the Government has not put on the table. I find it difficult to think that an agency that may be responsible for ensuring the collection of customs duties is not doing any scoping whatsoever. It baffles me, not because it should provide a solution to the British Government but it should inform our negotiators as to the different scenarios that may be on the table in the negotiations. I asked two questions. Will the Minister confirm the Revenue is not engaged in contingency planning in respect of the application of customs duties at the Border? Was there an intervention, direct or otherwise, by the Minister, the Department or Government in respect of the Revenue ceasing the type of work it was doing on the draft report or any other work it intended to do?

We are clear that a customs policy that is as close as possible to the current customs union will minimise any of the difficulties our island will then need to face. The Revenue Commissioners are aware of the negotiations that are under way, they are inputting into our team as the negotiations continue and we will be prepared for the outcomes that emerge from the British decision to leave the EU. First and foremost, however, we need to reach political agreement on what will be the customs policy between Britain and the EU and the impact of that on the island. Neither my Department nor I influenced the Revenue Commissioners in any way in respect of their work and I am not aware of such influence having been exerted on them.

As part of budget 2018, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 4.3 % for this year and 3.5% for next year. The benefit of this growth will be felt in the labour market, with an additional 48,000 jobs projected to be created next year. Recent economic indicators have generally been positive. Real GDP grew by 5.8% in the second quarter of this year on an annual basis. This follows annual growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. While headline GDP figures can be exaggerated in an Irish context, other indicators such as employment, unemployment trends and taxation receipts confirm the strong recovery.   Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.4% recorded in the second quarter of 2017, representing the creation of more than 48,000 additional jobs over the year. The increase in employment remains broad-based, with gains recorded in 11 of the 14 sectors reported by the Central Statistics Office, CSO. The continued growth in employment has seen the unemployment rate fall from more than 15% in 2012 to 6.1% in September 2017. However, a number of risks are present, including the UK’s decision to exit the EU and the possibility of significant tax reform in the US. In addition, the sharp appreciation of the euro rate against sterling is posing significant challenges, particularly for traditional sectors such as the tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-Border trade. These sources of uncertainty highlight the importance of careful management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that improve the resilience of the economy. In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain stable and that our economic fundamentals are strong, although the level of uncertainty remains elevated. In this regard, it is critical that appropriate polices are implemented and that is what the Government will continue to do.

Our views are clear on the matter. I outlined them earlier on in response to Deputy Michael McGrath. I do not foresee any circumstances in which the ability of our State to set our corporation tax rate in the way we do so at the moment will be affected by the proposals from the European Commission. More broadly, all of this debate emphasises the need to have an economy that has many sources of growth, as opposed to the single source of growth in the period leading up to the crash, which was construction, supported by our banking sector. It is a further reason to take all the steps we can to make our national finances as resilient as possible, where we reduce the need for our State to borrow and have our national debt on a path where it is beginning to fall.

I am informed by Revenue that many outdoor operations are carried out by their joint investigation units with some operations carried out on a multi-agency basis with other Departments or agencies such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Workplace Relations Commission. The role of Revenue’s joint investigation units is to detect non-compliance with tax and duty obligations, including the non-operation of the PAYE system, arising from bogus self-employment. As regards recent work of Revenue’s joint investigation units, for the first half of 2017, they carried out 5,450 outdoor visits, of which 1,841 were with other agencies. Revenue officers visited a total of 656 building sites, of which 231 visits were with other agencies. The results of this activity include the registering of 78 businesses as an employer for PAYE purposes, the registering of 685 individuals as employees and the registering of 145 persons as self-employed. As regards the construction sector, 38 persons were registered as an employer for PAYE purposes, 227 individuals were registered as employees and 44 persons were registered as self-employed. In addition, 291 individuals in the construction sector were re-classified from subcontractor to employee. The Deputy will be aware that the PAYE system applies to the wages of employees in all sectors whereas relevant contracts tax, RCT, applies to subcontractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry sectors. As to the Deputy’s specific question on RCT-related figures for 2015 and 2016 and to date in 2017, I will give the Deputy a table of the figures given to my officials by Revenue.

Those are interesting facts. I can tell the Minister, however, that the raid which I think was prompted by my question in July on the Dolphin's Barn refurbishment site was a joke. It took place in the canteen. People were invited to come into the canteen rather than officials from Revenue and the Workplace Relations Commission going around the site, grabbing people and asking them for their details. It was a way out of getting to the bottom of what was going on at that site.Some of the people whose details were taken on that day, who would have been identified as being employed on that site on that day, got notification from Revenue that they started their employment only a month later, even though they had been working on that site for several months, which suggests a significant problem. It is interesting that the Minister cannot tell whether these are gross or net figures. I put it to him that this is very important because the gross figure in previous years comes down to a net figure of next to nothing when offsets and repayments are taken into account. We need to get the net figure coming in under relevant contracts tax, RCT, after refunds and offsets.

I thank the Minister for saying that the publication of the report on bogus self-employment, which I commissioned as a Minister, and on which the Departments of Social Protection and Finance cooperated, including reference to the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is imminent. I have been asking about this for well over a year. The report was very specific. There was extensive input from the trade unions, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU. I do not understand why it should not be released. People are going onto sites and do not have a choice. A 25 year old construction worker may feel that-----

I do not accept the distinction between gross and net taxation. People pay their tax and that is collected but the table I have here goes through the tax collected under the RCT system, and any tax then offset against tax liabilities and so on. I will provide all of that information to the Deputy. I cannot comment on the operation mounted on the site the Deputy referred to because I do not have information on how it was conducted. It is clear from the number of visits made by the Revenue Commissioners, and the outcome of those visits, as I told the House a moment ago, that it is having an effect in dealing with this issue. Looking at the number of employees registered, at the reclassification of individuals, this appears to be the very kind of activity that the Deputy has been calling for. These are the figures for the number of on-site visits and their effect. I will soon receive a report from the working group I mentioned earlier to Deputy Burton and others and the paper emerging from that will be published.

The problem is that it has not come with a proper outcome. The workers involved received notification from Revenue that they started their employment in August following the question I raised here in July, even though they were on site in July and would have got the workers' details then and the workers were employed from April or May. What was going on before August? Are the subcontractor and main contractor being held accountable for the fact that there was undoubtedly tax fraud going on prior to that? Still the record has not been rectified. The difference between net and gross is very important. In 2009, for example, there was €436 million gross tax paid under RCT. The offsets were €490 million, meaning that the revenue for RCT net was minus €53 million. Less than no tax came in from RCT. There were probably 60,000 or 70,000 workers under that heading, with no tax coming in. By comparison, under pay as you earn, PAYE, tax, there would be hundreds of millions of euro in tax. That is the comparison we need to get to because the public is losing tax revenue because of bogus self-employment.

I know that some Members of this House have also visited Catalonia, including recently, and their perspectives contribute to our consideration of the situation there. Irish people know Spain well. After Britain, it is the country that we travel to most. Cities and towns across Spain are home for many Irish people. In addition, some 1.8 million visits were made to Spain from Ireland during 2016. A growing and welcome element of this traffic is connected with the increasing number of Spaniards visiting and living in Ireland. What happens in Catalonia and Spain clearly matters to all of us in this House and in the communities that we represent. Tensions are running high but we must not lose sight of the fact that the Spain that we know well is an established democracy where citizens have full rights protected by the rule of law. In any democracy, political developments must take place within a legal framework. This is not a procedural point. This is a fundamental requirement if the rights of all citizens are to be protected. Respecting the rule of law, its possibilities and protections but also its limits, is not a choice but an obligation. The resolution of the current crisis needs to be within Spain's constitutional framework, through Spain's democratic institutions. The freedom to express contesting views is an essential check and balance in any democracy. However, differences of opinion must be contested with full respect for the law and the rights of all citizens. This is the foundation that underpins and protects modern democratic societies and indeed the functioning of the EU. We can disagree with and work to change the law but we cannot ignore the law as it stands or act beyond it.  We are all familiar with the vote in Catalonia on 1 October. I share the dismay felt by many people in Ireland and elsewhere at the disturbing clashes and injuries. Let me reiterate that violence has no place in politics. In Catalonia, and elsewhere in Spain, as in all our democracies, public representatives and all citizens must work to advance their goals within democratic institutions such as parliaments with full respect for the law. Clearly, any decision on a question as important as independence requires legitimacy. It requires legitimacy both in terms of the broadest possible political consensus and in terms of a sound legal framework. On that basis, the referendum vote of 1 October cannot be accepted as legitimate. I do not believe that it provides the basis for a declaration of independence. The holding of this referendum was ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court. It is clear, including from the massive gatherings that we have seen in Catalonia, that many there support independence but we also know that there are many others who do not. In early September, a small majority of the regional Catalan Parliament voted through referendum and transition legislation in controversial circumstances. Those in parliament opposed to the measures, who made up nearly half the region's parliamentarians, argued that the legislative process breached the parliament's own procedures and was illegal. Spain's constitutional court later ruled the legislation illegal. It is political dialogue rather than escalating tensions that we all want to see but dialogue needs to respect the constitution of Spain, the rights of all citizens of Spain and the regional and national parliamentary institutions that represent them. Any political action outside of that framework lacks legitimacy and cannot claim to respect the plurality of opinion across Spain.  I am conscious that there have been many calls for external involvement in the resolution of this matter, particularly after the violence that occurred on 1 October. However, the Government's position is that in Spain, as in any other country in the EU, internal political and constitutional arrangements are the prerogative of a country and its people and should be determined by them through the institutions of the country and in accordance with the rule of law. Internal divisions, contesting aspirations and robust debates are to be expected in any democracy but they have to be resolved in keeping with the rule of law. Constitutions can be changed, as we know, but this has to happen in a constitutional way. I, therefore, welcome the cross-party support in the Spanish Parliament for the establishment of a committee to consider the issue of constitutional reform, which may address some of the current concerns.  I am very concerned at the impact on people’s lives that the political uncertainty has given rise to, including the decisions of more than 1,000 companies to transfer their corporate headquarters out of Catalonia. I am also dismayed at reports of fractures within families and communities to which this divisive issue is giving rise. The validity and legitimacy of political effort requires, as I have said, securing the broadest possible consensus within the law. Citizens also deserve the certainty that the rule of law extends to them. This is why I remain of the view that it is for all Spaniards - all Catalans and all Spaniards - to arrive at a shared view on what steps within their laws and their own democratic institutions might best support a process towards a resolution. Clearly, this is proving very difficult. The decision taken by the Spanish Government to apply Article 155 of the constitution marks a significant point. Nonetheless, there still remains an opportunity for engagement. We hope that leaders take the necessary steps to return to the space where differing views are contested through national and regional democratic institutions with full respect always for the law and the rights of citizens. Upholding the constitution and the rule of law in all its aspects is a key underpinning of all democracies. Ireland respects the constitutional and territorial integrity and unity of Spain. The Government's position remains that the constitutional and political arrangements in Spain are matters to be determined by its own citizens though its own institutions in keeping with its own laws.

I am acutely conscious that we are discussing an issue that is a very sensitive, legal and constitutional matter for the Spanish Government, its people and the region of Catalonia. This is important as I do not believe that it is appropriate for any party here in the Dáil to attempt to manipulate or pretend that there is a simple solution to what is a very volatile and complex situation in Spain. We would not appreciate it if members of the Spanish Parliament tried to lecture us on what was or was not legal in Bunreacht na hÉireann. With the impact of social media and recent coverage, there is a risk of an over-simplification of what is happening in Spain and in Catalonia. We must delve into a deeper analysis and try to encourage a legal pathway and process for the people of Catalonia. This will only be facilitated with the agreement of the Spanish Government. As a democratic country, we have to stand by legal and constitutional principles. It is only the people of Spain as a whole who can decide on their own constitution. We know this from our own Constitution and the many referenda we hold here. As the Minister has outlined, Ireland has a very close relationship with Spain. Spain is very well known to us. There are nearly 2 million trips by Irish people to Spain every year and many thousands of Spanish students spend their summers here and get to understand our culture and country. We share many traits. Like us, Spain has had a diverse and proud history. All of this feeds into the passionate beliefs on both sides of the Catalonia-Spain divide. Catalonia has been part of Spain since the 15th century and Catalan identity has always been part of Spanish cultural history. Initially, it was very tightly integrated into Spanish identity but in the middle of the 19th century, there was a renewed sense of Catalan identity. Catalans have their own language in addition to Spanish and under Catalan law, all teachers, doctors and public sector workers are required to use Catalan as well as Spanish. When Spain became a republic in 1931, very soon after our own independence, Catalonia was given broad autonomy until the horrific years of General Franco, whose regime suppressed and revoked Catalan autonomy. The use of the language was also restricted. After Franco's death and many years later, the Spanish Government allowed Catalonia to reinstate its own parliament and executive and the region has extensive autonomy. There are approximately 17 regions in Spain that have various levels of autonomy.  While Catalonia is one of the wealthiest regions in Spain, it is now one of the most indebted and had to go through many austerity measures since the global collapse in 2008. Since that very difficult economic time, the calls for independence have increased. Many citizens in Catalonia believe that region pays an awful lot of taxes to central government in Madrid and gets very little in return. It is one of the most industrial regions in Spain, has become the home of the chemical industry in Spain and also specialises in the service sector, food processing, banking and manufacturing, particularly textiles.  In 2010, the Spanish constitutional court set limits to the people's or the executive's call for "nationhood". In my view, this has - naturally, some would say - fuelled further calls for increased sovereignty and independence. However, it was a ruling of the Spanish constitutional court and that cannot be selectively interpreted or ignored. As fellow constitutional democrats, we know how different calls for independence are dealt with. We saw in recent years the long and detailed process the Scottish Parliament went through to allow a referendum on independence which was narrowly defeated in 2015. The media have rightly highlighted the most recent referendum and the violence that took place over three weeks ago. Anybody who was watching the reports was appalled by the unnecessary high-handedness of the Spanish police. The injuries are to be condemned and are unacceptable. I welcome that Prime Minister Rajoy has admitted mistakes were made at that time. We cannot ignore the fact the referendum was not legal under the Spanish constitution. It was not a referendum such as we would have in Ireland because before it was taken and right up to polling day the Spanish Government was at pains to point out it was unconstitutional and therefore illegal. Public opinion is divided on seeking independence in Catalonia. The percentage of people who voted in the referendum was just over 40%. While the majority voted for independence, the number that did not vote cannot be ignored. We have to put the turnout in context. It is very unfortunate that following the recent referendum there seems to be a stand-off between the Spanish Government and the Catalan regional Government. While independence may be what many citizens want, it will be properly achieved only through consultation and agreement with the Spanish Government. Many in Catalonia want to remain in Spain. It ill behoves any group or party, in Spain or outside, to try to dictate otherwise. It will only add to and increase existing tensions. It would be a retrograde step to jeopardise the current regional autonomy and may allow the situation to be inflamed. It is only Spanish citizens who can determine their preferred constitutional and political arrangements through their own democratic institutions. Free and fair legal elections in Catalonia would allow people a truly democratic mechanism to express their views and reaffirm their right to have a say in how Spain and Catalonia proceed. A unilateral exit by Catalonia from Spain will only have negative social, political and legal ramifications. I and my party believe that a peaceful pathway with external assistance, if necessary, will achieve a non-violent resolution by all sides. The next number of days are critical and the path ahead uncertain. We have been calling for all sides to show restraint and to refrain from actions or words that would only serve to aggravate the situation further. Support therefore should be given to efforts that encourage dialogue and facilitate the stabilisation of existing relationships. As a country that has experienced its own conflict, we know first hand how important support, dialogue and diplomacy are in such trying times and the benefits that dialogue can bring. Our history shows us that even in the most difficult situations compromise can be reached. The European Union and its institutions, where practical and feasible, should use its influence to try to de-escalate tension in the country. The stability of Spain is in all our collective interests and in the collective interest of every citizen of the European Union.

Tá nasc stairiúil maith idir mhuintir na hÉireann agus mhuintir na Spáinne agus na Catalóine. I also want to welcome our visitors to the Public Gallery. There are longstanding links between the people of Spain, Catalonia and Ireland. Sinn Féin appreciates and celebrates those links. The dispute between the people of Catalonia and the Spanish state over independence will only be resolved through dialogue. Thus far the Spanish Government is refusing to open a dialogue without the Catalans acquiescing to pre-conditions, including an acceptance that any talk of independence is illegal under Spanish law. That is the wrong approach. I make no apologies for saying it. It was not that long ago it was illegal to expound a united Ireland or anti-partitionist view. The crisis has deepened so the refusal by the Spanish Government to embrace dialogue is justified by it on the premise that these issues are an internal matter for the Spanish state. That is echoed by some of the comments made here today. It is exactly the pretext that was used by the British state for decades to prevent the scrutiny of British rule in the North. The international community, especially the European Union, must directly engage with the Spanish and Catalan Governments and seek to broker a mediation process to hammer out an agreement that is democratic and peaceful and which avoids conflict. Any refusal to do this puts at risk the possibility of reaching a peaceful solution to a very complex situation. The Taoiseach has said in the Chamber that he supports the need for dialogue and negotiations. He has also said he would put his views and concerns directly to Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy at an appropriate time. The European Council meetings at the end of last week provided such an opportunity. The Taoiseach or Minister should outline the approach the Taoiseach took. Did the Taoiseach promote the imperative of dialogue as a means of addressing the problems, as he said he would here? Did he speak directly to the Spanish Prime Minister on this matter as he committed to do? He did that without being asked; he volunteered to do it. Did he impress upon Prime Minister Rajoy the view of the Irish Government that inclusive talks present the best way forward? If it is the view of the Irish Government, one would presume it would seek to promote that view. We know dialogue works and we know the broad principles that are involved. A process must be inclusive with all parties treated as equals and all mandates respected. They are the principles that worked in our situation. All issues must be on the agenda and nothing agreed until everything is agreed. There should be no preconditions and no vetoes. Participants should be prepared to take risks to engage in initiatives. That is a matter for the respective parties. There should be no predetermined outcome and no attempt to preclude any outcome. There should be a timeframe. The role of the international community is vital because international experience shows the participation and encouragement of international actors in any process of negotiation and mediation can be the difference between success and failure. I will make the point on our Government and Taoiseach again. Did the Taoiseach impress on those at the European Council meeting the notion that dialogue is the only way to resolve the crisis? Could we be given an account of how he did it? That is a very modest thing to do given the broad acceptance everywhere that we Irish have at least resolved matters. We did it through talking. Have we persuaded others to do that?

It is good that people are sitting down together. The argument we are putting forward is that people do not only need to sit together, they also need to talk. I have previously raised with the Minister my deep concerns that in the build up to the independence referendum in Catalonia on 1 October there were unprecedented attacks on fundamental rights and civil and political liberties. I do not have the time to go into the background. The Minister is familiar with it. I wrote to him and tabled parliamentary questions. I also wrote to his predecessor on the issue. On 1 October many of our worst fears were confirmed when we saw horrific incidents of police brutality against peaceful citizens who were simply trying to vote. Over 900 people were injured in this crackdown on democracy. Incredibly, the Spanish Minister for foreign affairs, who appeared on "The Andrew Marr Show" on Sunday, said the images of police violence in Catalonia were fake news. The Deputy Prime Minister said the police violence was proportionate. Does the Minister, Deputy Coveney, believe the Spanish police response was proportionate and acceptable? If he believes it was unacceptable, will he tell his Spanish counterpart this? We know there are clashing interpretations of the Spanish constitution relating to whether the referendum was legal or illegal. Since the referendum on 1 October, the Catalan Government has reached out to the Spanish state and requested dialogue and negotiation to find a peaceful resolution to their differences. For years, the Spanish Government has repeatedly avoided any dialogue on Catalonia's political demands on the grounds of legalistic arguments.The Spanish state’s response to this peaceful, reasonable, and thoughtful approach has been one of aggression. Last week, the head of the Catalan National Assembly, ANC, and the head of Òmnium Cultural, both popular pro-independence civil society organisations, were jailed without bail while their trial on sedition charges continues. Sedition is an extremely serious charge and they face up to 15 years in prison if convicted, yet it seems these same sedition charges were brought forward by the Spanish prosecutor simply because these men took part in peaceful protests in the build up to the 1 October independence referendum and on the day of the vote. I am deeply concerned that the Spanish High Court has jailed these civil society activists and that they are really being prosecuted for organising peaceful demonstrations. These two men should be released immediately. Over the weekend, the Spanish Government initiated the procedure to suspend Catalan autonomy by invoking article 155 of the Spanish constitution. The Spanish Cabinet agreed to remove the President of Catalonia and all members of the Catalan Cabinet from their posts. Ministries in Madrid will control the management of the Catalan Administration, as well as directing the Catalan local police forces, and Catalonia’s public television and radio channels. The President of Catalonia has called it the worst attack on Catalan institutions since the dictator, General Franco, ordered the end of Catalonia's autonomy. It is completely unacceptable that the Spanish Government is removing a democratically elected government because it is moving forward with policies for which it has a democratic and legitimate mandate. The current Catalan Government was elected on the promise of holding a binding democratic referendum on independence. There is a pro-independence majority in the Catalan Parliament. The vast majority of Catalans polled consistently want a binding referendum on independence. In the face of the naked police brutality that we saw and crackdown by the Spanish police, 2.3 million Catalans, nearly 43% of the electorate, still came out to vote on 1 October. The Taoiseach has pointed to this in an attempt to delegitimise the referendum. However, we have had ten different referendums on constitutional amendments in this State with a lower voter turnout than the Catalan referendum, despite those referendums being unhindered, as the Catalan referendum was. We still respected the outcome of those votes. I have also heard repeated statements that this is an internal matter for Spain. It is clear that what is happening in Catalonia is a matter for everyone who cares about democracy. The Spanish state’s actions are an unacceptable violation of European democratic values. Catalan public representatives democratically elected by citizens are being unilaterally removed by politicians from parties with minimal or no representation in the Catalan Parliament. This is not an internal matter; it is about people’s rights and aspirations. In my opinion, the Government of Catalonia’s proposal for dialogue is sincere, but it is not compatible with the current repressive climate and rising tension. I urge the Spanish Government to take up this offer and to refrain from applying article 155 and removing the Catalan Government from its elected office. Dialogue is the way forward.

Carles Puigdemont told his parliament on 10 October:The current moment is serious enough for everyone to assume their corresponding responsibility, and for the necessity to de-escalate tension and not to contribute to it, neither through word nor gesture...[T]he way forward can be none other than through democracy and peace. That means respecting those who think differently, and finding a way to make possible collective aspirations, with the realisation that that requires a large dose of dialogue and empathy.There was little enough dialogue or empathy shown by the Madrid authorities ten days previously, when they resorted to unacceptable tactics in their efforts to prevent the independence referendum. To those of us who live by the principles and practices of electoral politics, to see uniformed men smashing their way into polling stations and carrying away ballot boxes and polling papers is to see a form of secular sacrilege. Madrid’s tactics have made Madrid’s police force the natural enemy of many Catalonians. This was avoidable. It was, at best, heavy-handed and ham-fisted. I said at the time, and I repeat, that any violence against voters and polling station officials is unacceptable and unjustifiable. The subsequent escalation, which involved the use of plastic bullets and physical intimidation by the Spanish police, must also be condemned. The Madrid authorities seem to be going out of their way to make the pro-independence parties more acceptable to their own people. They are creating support for independence at home and abroad. If they stick to this heavy-handed approach, then the police and the Spanish Government will only further inflame the dispute and strengthen the independence movement. It is not good enough for the European Commission, looking only to the constitutional issue, to describe the crisis as an internal matter for the Spanish. All of us, as member states of the European Union, have an obligation to observe democratic principles in our dealings with all our citizens. All that said, I also agree with those in this House and elsewhere who have called for dialogue and rapprochement. Life is more complicated than simply making a declaration. Touting simple solutions to complex issues can do real harm to real people. Apart from anything else, should a Catalonian universal declaration of independence include the administrative area of Aran? This small valley is in Catalonia but it is home to a separate Aranese population with its own history, its own capital and autonomous government, its own language, and even, because of its location, its own microclimate. Should the Aranese, all 10,000 of them, be allowed to secede from both Catalonia and from Spain, and set up their own state? This debate has a particular resonance for us in this House. We are coming up to the centenary of the first meeting of Dáil Éireann, when our forebears addressed their message to the free nations of the world. We wanted our case on the agenda at the Versailles treaty talks. We insisted:Nationally, the race, the language, the customs and traditions of Ireland are radically distinct from the English. Ireland is one of the most ancient nations in Europe, and she has preserved her national integrity, vigorous and intact, through seven centuries of foreign oppression: she has never relinquished her national rights, and throughout the long era of English usurpation she has in every generation defiantly proclaimed her inalienable right of nationhood down to her last glorious resort to arms in 1916.The Catalonian separatists could repeat this language, almost word for word, perhaps citing fewer examples of resort to arms. In the 1916 Proclamation, the existence of a significant unionist population on this island, with its own culture, tradition and religion, was only fleetingly and grudgingly referenced. It was described as "differences carefully fostered by an alien Government", which had divided a minority from the majority in the past, and to which we, the majority, should be oblivious. We were indeed oblivious to those differences for many decades, and the result was bloodshed and mayhem. As Senator McDowell commented at the weekend, no one was more strongly opposed to the unionists’ claim of entitlement to opt out of Ireland than those Irish nationalists who proclaimed the right to opt out of the United Kingdom. Self-determination as a principle is unwieldy and can produce wildly unexpected results. When, for example, the European Union cobbled together principles for the international recognition as states of the various component parts of the collapsing Yugoslavia, it might have thought it was doing a good day's work.However, the same principles were applied by Russia and the Government of Crimea to assert the latter's right to opt out of Ukraine and become part of Russia once again. To be clear, there was a referendum to determine the future status of Crimea in March 2014. It was organised by the Legislature of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and by the local government of Sevastopol, both of which were subdivisions of Ukraine. The referendum requested local populations to decide whether they wanted Crimea to join Russia as a federal state. It was declared unlawful by the Ukrainian Government and the official result, as people will recall, was that more than 95% voted for integration of the region into the Russian Federation. The turnout was 80%. I do not believe that is the precedent Catalonians would want to follow. To this day, only Russia and ten other states recognise Crimea as part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine continues to claim Crimea as an integral part of its territory and is supported by most of the rest of the world, including in the form of UN General Assembly Resolution 68/262. Before the Berlin Wall fell and when the Cold War was still being waged, the Helsinki Final Act, signed by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975, was a major step forward towards normal and peaceful relations. Thirty five states, including the USA, the USSR and most of Europe signed a declaration in an attempt to improve relations between the then communist bloc and the West. The Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between Participating States enumerated ten fundamental principles. All the principles are important, notwithstanding the fact that some of them may well, in practice, be in conflict. For example, the states of Europe are committed to non-intervention in each other's internal affairs as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the equal rights and self-determination of peoples. Ireland signed the Helsinki Final Act even though at that time we had our own issues about recognising the inviolability of national frontiers. The Helsinki Accords significantly reduced Cold War tensions by recognising the frontiers in Europe and that they should be stable and could only change by peaceful internal means. When we look at a country like Spain, many of us expect that all disputes can be settled by internal peaceful dialogue. Looking back on our own history, many would have expected no less of us. A commitment to self-determination - pure and simple - seems so right but to quote Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, "Hitherto, the rights and wrongs had seemed so beautifully simple." Real life is not so pure and never so simple. If this country has anything to teach the rest of Europe about these matters, it is that there is nothing inevitable about peace, there is nothing more important than dialogue and empathy and nothing so life-saving as negotiation and compromise. We should not be taking sides in this dispute. I say that not because it is simply an internal Spanish matter but rather because we have a far greater interest in seeing this dispute peacefully resolved than we have in seeing one side victorious over the other. It is not international law that will settle this matter, although that is important. The legal rules about self-determination and the recognition of new states are still uncertain. Practice changed in 1991 and, as I have said, the change in practice produced at least one result that surprised most people. Peaceful settlement is the only principle that matters. All other principles are subordinate. What is needed now is a commitment from both sides to mediation, dialogue and negotiation. I echo the words of Kofi Annan and The Elders, which include our own Mary Robinson, to the effect that the progress that Spain has made since its democratic transition in 1975 should not be put at risk. The potential political, economic and social repercussions of a protracted crisis should not be underestimated. Both sides must refrain from any more divisive and inflammatory language or actions. I join Kofi Annan, and I hope other Members will do so too, in urging the Spanish Government and the regional government of Catalonia to renew their commitment to a resolution of this conflict through dialogue and find a peaceful route out of this crisis.

It comes on top of the jailing of two leading civil society activists pending charges that could result in 15 years imprisonment for each. These two men are currently political prisoners facing a form of internment. It also comes in the aftermath of the police rampage against communities coming out to vote in the 1 October Catalan referendum, a rampage which resulted in 900 persons being injured and which shocked the world. I am not the only one who has heard echoes of the Franco dictatorship in these events. I understand the Spanish ambassador is in the Gallery this evening and I would say to him, quite clearly, shame on the Spanish state for these actions.

The actions of the Spanish state serve to confirm the observation of Friedrich Engels that the state, in the last analysis, can be reduced to armed bodies of men acting in defence of private property. Furthermore, the events of recent weeks undermine the image the European Union likes to project of itself, namely, that it embodies modern European values such as liberty, democracy and progress. Tens of millions of European citizens have watched with a very critical eye as the Spanish state batters senior citizens, women and others off the streets while the grandees of the European Union sit in silence and only break that silence to offer excuses and justifications for the actions of their cousins in Madrid. Esquera Revolucionària, the Catalan Marxist group, recently stated, "The justification that the PP and its government are merely applying the law cannot mask the fact that the law is unfair and undemocratic and goes directly against the aspirations of millions of Catalans they are trying to muzzle." In this sense, the savage repression of the Spanish state and its support for a fundamentally undemocratic political position, a denial of the right to decide, go hand in hand. The repressive actions of the Spanish state have been met with a magnificent mass movement of protest and resistance, including, to date, a student general strike, a workers general strike, demonstrations of people in their hundreds of thousands and one demonstration of more than 1 million individuals. The activation of Article 155 should provide the signal for a general strike of unlimited duration. Socialists in Ireland will stand in solidarity with socialists in Catalonia who say that Catalonia is a nation and has a right to decide its own future, that the working class through the entire Spanish state must show solidarity and mobilise against this repression; that the future of Catalonia must be carved out by the masses who defined police repression to vote on 1 October and who made the general strike on 3 October, not by the Puigdemont government, which has wavered on declaring independence and which has imposed austerity on its own people; and that a Catalan socialist republic could abolish evictions, austerity cuts and mass joblessness among the young. It could do that if it put the wealth of Catalonia at the disposal of its people, starting with the introduction of strong capital controls and then socialising the 1,000 plus companies that have attempted to sabotage the republic by moving their corporate headquarters from Catalonia to elsewhere in the Spanish state. A Catalan socialist republic would guarantee minorities their full civil rights. It would aim in all its actions to unite all working people in Catalan society, namely, those who speak Catalan, those who speak Spanish, those who speak both and others. Eighty years ago George Orwell penned his outstanding eye witness account of socialist revolution, Homage to Catalonia.A socialist transformation of Catalonia today would put on the agenda not just the fall of the Rajoy government but also a challenge to capitalism throughout the whole of the Spanish state. Socialists will defend to the hilt the right of the Catalan people to decide their own future. We will defend this right hand in hand with the fight for socialist change in Catalonia, in the rest of the Spanish state and indeed throughout Europe.

I have great love for Spanish culture and the Spanish people. However, I can do nothing but condemn in the strongest possible terms the outrageous repression, violence and brutality being meted out by the Spanish state against an entirely peaceful movement. I find it quite extraordinary that our Government along with the main Opposition party - Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party - are giving cover to the Spanish state and are providing excuses for it by talking about the need to operate through that state's constitutional order and its government's policies, which are specifically designed to crush a peaceful movement by force and if necessary through the use of violence and repression. That is the point. All this abstract "on the one hand and on the other hand" stuff masks the silence and failure of the political establishment in Ireland and Europe to call a spade a spade. What has the Spanish state done in response to successive peaceful efforts on the part of the Catalonian people over many years to change the situation? They were not even initially about independence but were rather an effort to increase autonomy and to have a dialogue and votes to allow for self-determination. At every hand's turn, the Spanish state has sought to scupper that and to cut off any kind of peaceful approach to reform, enhanced autonomy or giving the people of Catalonia the right to democratic self-determination. Mr. Rajoy, in particular, has made his political career on trying to deny, crush, scupper and frustrate the peaceful efforts of the Catalonian people to exercise self-determination. Our Government just will not call it for what it is: sending in 6,000 paramilitary police; going without court orders to the headquarters of political parties in government and organising raids on them; arresting parliamentarians; arresting civil servants; raiding newspapers and printworks that produce newspapers; trying to scupper free debate; seizing 10 million ballot papers; seizing leaflets being produced that were pro-referendum or pro-independence; and using physical force and violence to prevent people from getting to ballot boxes. In the last couple of days there have been threats to use force to impose direct rule and disband a democratically elected government. Our Government sits by and does not condemn this. Self-determination is an elementary principle. I think it is the first article of the UN charter. It is about freely determining, without external interference, the political status and to pursue the economic, social and cultural development of a people. By any definition, the people of Catalonia at least have a case as to having a cultural history, a national history and the right to express their view on the matter. However, the Spanish state and its constitution are saying, "Never. That is not on the agenda." In the same way, Britain for a very long time would have said to Ireland, "Sorry lads, there is no peaceful way to achieve this. We are not allowing it because it is our union and we will decide." This is a Spanish state that has a history of fascism and authoritarianism. We are seeing some of that authoritarian tendency articulated against a completely peaceful movement. What is surprising, in fact, is how peaceful the Catalonian movement still manages to be given the level of provocation, repression and violence and the denial of any sort of democratic avenue to the people. The Irish Government and the Opposition should be condemning what the Spanish state is doing instead of giving cover for it. We should give a little bit of support to a peaceful movement regardless of our views on independence. We should just uphold basic principles of civil liberties, self-determination, democracy and the right of civil society actors to campaign for independence without being imprisoned for sedition. Could the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade not do that?
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	297	I am sharing time with Deputy Joan Collins. A couple of years ago, I was in Barcelona at the invitation of Diplocat, with a number of Deputies and Senators. Diplocat is a public private partnership and is all about fostering dialogue and building relations between the citizens of Catalonia and other countries. They were looking for the active involvement of Catalan society in exchanging views and ideas in areas like government, business, culture and education. It was all about promoting a fairer, more peaceful, democratic and sustainable world. We met a number of Catalan stakeholders including political parties, civil society and members of the Government of Catalonia. Those meetings were open and frank. We met people who were pro-independence and those who were against it. We met those who were in favour of a more federal type system of government that would respect the culture, identity and ethnicity of all of the regions. Since then, I have met a number of other Catalan leaders and communities. One thing that came across was that they were very proud of the relationship between Ireland and Catalonia. The constitutional court handed down a ruling declaring that the law of consultations approved by the Parliament of Catalonia was unconstitutional. That law was approved by 106 MPs in favour and 28 against. That shows support for a law that would have created the possibility for government to hold non-binding consultations to seek citizens' opinions on a topic of general interest. The consultation would not have been legally binding, yet the constitutional court still thought it was not relevant or pertinent to ask citizens their opinions on these matters. I admit if I were non-Catalan and a Spaniard, I think I probably would not want to see a break-up of Spain because no doubt it would be followed by other regions such as the Basque region or Galicia. However, the question has to be asked as to why there is this desire for self-determination. Why has it arisen now particularly? It does come back to the central Government in Madrid not being willing to engage in that dialogue that we all think is so very important. Under international law, as others have stated, sovereignty is a most important foundation. Although this is a sovereign question for Spain, the situation has been worsened by what we can only describe as bully-boy tactics from Madrid fuelled, I think, by the shortage of a democratic tradition in Spain's history. We in Ireland have moved past our civil war politics but I think it is a different matter in Spain. There is no doubt that some commentators have seen elements of Francoism in this. Madrid appeared to be resisting democracy and it is certainly not helping those Catalan people who want to remain in the Spanish state. We were all horrified by what we saw. We were horrified by the repression that took place when people tried to exercise the democratic right to vote, regardless of whether that vote was legitimate and regardless of our opinions on that question. We have the report from accredited, experienced election observers who saw numerous and repeated violations of civil and human rights. It was clear to them that there was a centrally orchestrated, military-style operation that had been planned carefully. There were armed, masked officers coming into polling stations trying to prevent a peaceful, democratic process. The observers also noted the very peaceful nature of the Catalan people. That violence and repression really shows how we do not learn from history. We know from history that repression only fuels and hardens those who are being repressed. We saw it in our own history in 1916. Prior to the executions in 1916, everybody wanted Home Rule but after them it was a very different matter. It is very likely that those Catalans who did not want independence will be hardened in their attitude and will be joining the pro-independence movement. We could look at the example from Scotland. Although there are historic differences between the two countries, it is the same principle. What we saw in Scotland was dignified debate. The two sides - "Better Together" and "Yes Scotland" - could debate all of those issues. It goes back to the right to self-determination as a principle in international law. The EU only saw that as applying to states that are already recognised as independent.The European Court of Justice has ruled that Article 1 of the charter guarantees the right of self-determination to states that are not yet independent. The history of Catalonia, dating back to Ferdinand and Isabella, is a difficult one but there is no doubt but that Catalonia has a separate culture, identity and language regardless of that legal standing internationally. The Minister referred to the need for political dialogue. Fine Gael as a member of the European People's Party, EPP, of which the ruling party in Spain is also a member, is in a unique position to advance that dialogue. It is only through dialogue and people engaging and listening in an atmosphere of mutual respect that these issues can be resolved in a peaceful manner.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	298	I read the Minister's speech. All things being equal, it would have been a reasonable speech but for the actions of 1 October, which changed things drastically. People around the world were rightly shocked to see a modern state, a member state of the EU, use brutal police violence to stop EU citizens in Catalonia from exercising their right to vote in a referendum called by the Catalan regional government. They were shocked to hear of the raids of political activists, organisers and media organisations. On the day on which the declaration of independence was expected, people were fearful of returning to their homes lest they would be raided at night. This is the type of fear that is being generated throughout Catalonia within the pro-independence movement. The silence of Brussels on this disgraceful episode was deafening. Where there have been some general rejections of violence, including by the Taoiseach, and general talk of the need for dialogue, this was a fudge. It completely ignored what happened on the day, which changed things. The violence was not general. It came from one side only, namely, the Civil Guard on the order of the Spanish Government. The violence by the Spanish state should have been condemned, with no beating around the bush. Similarly, general talk of the need for dialogue is mealy-mouthed as it was the Rajoy Government that refused to talk. Its refusal to engage in dialogue should be condemned without equivocation.  As in the case of the independence referendum in Scotland, this issue raises the issue of the position of the EU on the right of nations to self-determination. This right is a key part of the UN's charter on human rights. It has the status of international law and, therefore, can be viewed, legally, as part of EU law even though there is no direct reference to it in the EU treaties. This is an issue the EU must deal with. A second referendum will take place in Scotland at some point in the future. A hard Brexit can quickly change the mood in Scotland.  There is now a crisis in Spain brought about by the intransigence of the political elite in Spain. The brutal attempted repression of the referendum will no doubt increase support for the independence in Catalonia. The imposition of direct rule will not resolve the issues, rather it will increase polarisation. This morning, I listened to teachers, fire-fighters and Catalan police state they will not accept the rule of law of Spain and that they are governed by the Catalan regional parliament. As we know in this country, the national question is not easily resolved. It is a complex issue. One person's right to self-determination can often mean the denial of the same right to another. It is not just a matter of law, whether national, EU or international. It is also not just a matter of who has a majority, even in a democratic vote. Those who believe a Border poll in Ireland will resolve the issue here are ignoring the reality of the past 100 years, never mind the period of the so-called Troubles. The Government and this Parliament should without equivocation condemn the actions of the Spanish Government and the use of police violence and repression against peaceful citizens of the EU. We must condemn the arrest and imprisonment of Catalan politicians and activists for expressing their legitimate political views and their right to assemble on the streets of Spain. We must condemn the imposition of direct rule and the overthrow of the democratically-elected Catalan regional government and should call on the Spanish Government to immediately engage in dialogue without preconditions and with mutual respect for the Catalonian people.

None of us were happy to see the violence and clashes shown on our television screens. I acknowledge and welcome the Minister's reference in his speech to there being no place in a democracy for violence. They are wise words and it is important they are put on the record of the Dáil. It is also important that in this situation politics and negotiation work. I have great regard for my colleagues in the Sinn Féin Party and all the other parties that worked for many years to bring about a resolution to the difficulties we had in Ireland. We have proved that politics, negotiations and agreements can work. As a result of that work, lives are being saved every day. We would like to see similar compromises and agreements between the Catalonian people and the Spanish Government. I welcome this debate as it provides us with an opportunity to thrash out this issue and allows people to express their views. Nobody should be derogatory of one side or the other. We should seek compromise and agreement on a framework for the future. I could not let this opportunity pass without acknowledging that for 28 years my late mother spent three months of every winter in Spain. She made many great friends there and was thought of very highly. That is my affiliation and association and people can take what they like from that information. I reject violence and clashes in the streets. I want to see people negotiating, taking the lead from other parts of Europe that have had difficulties and resolved them through dialogue and politics. That is the proper thing to do. Hopefully, there will be a resolution to the current difficulties in the near future. 
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	306	I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I issue a fáilte Uí Cheallaigh to the Spanish ambassador and his colleagues. Irish ambassadors all over the world expect and get respect in the vast majority of countries. We must keep diplomatic channels open at all times and engage with that process. Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital city, has more than 7.5 million inhabitants. It is a well known fact that the region has traditionally been one of the most dynamic industrial and innovative areas of Spain. It is with immense sorrow that we witnessed the increasing escalation of hostilities between the central government and the governing authorities and people of Catalonia. The violence and protests are deeply disturbing and are increasingly pushing the country into something that could be akin to a mini civil war. As people who witnessed similar events here from 1969 up to a number of years ago, in respect of which there is still some baggage hanging around, we do not want to see that happen in any country. At the end of the day, it is the ordinary people who suffer. Sin an scéal i gconaí.It is the ordinary people - the man or woman on the street, the ordinary shopkeeper, small businessman or farmer - and their children who suffer. While Members can appreciate the desire of the Spanish Government to impose respect for the constitutional process, we can also sympathise with the deeply felt desire of the Catalonian people for self-determination and are well aware of such desire because of Ireland's centuries-long struggle for independence. The events in Catalonia are part of a much wider process engulfing Europe and the western world. People are sick, sore and tired of being dictated to by central governments. That has been the case in Ireland. That was obvious when the banking situation was discussed earlier in the House and the Government showed it is totally out of touch and supports those in the banking sector at the expense of ordinary people. Does the Government expect people to lie down? One can only kick a dog so many times before it will get up and bark and bite. A movement for increased self-determination is also under way in Lombardy and Veneto in Italy. I qualify my sympathy and support for the Catalonian people by saying that any violence committed by either side of the conflict must be rightly condemned. Members saw the reactions at polling booths to polling going ahead. I was horrified to see the ferocity involved and people arriving with sledges, axes and other equipment to break down polling booths and tear people out of them. It is hard to believe that could happen in a modern-day society such as Spain. It must be condemned, as must violence on any side. The Minister will condemn that because no Member of this House condones such conduct. There has been an almost total focus on the action of the Spanish authorities. However, Peter Preston noted in an article for The Guardian newspaper that the head fact checker for the El Objective television show claimed many pictures purporting to be of the Catalan demonstrations were faked. The fact checker produced web pictures of bleeding protesters that went viral but were actually from a miners’ strike that took place five years previously. A photo of a woman who had allegedly had all her fingers broken was misrepresentative and the woman did not have broken fingers. It was alleged that a six year old boy had been paralysed by police brutality but that did not happen, thank God. We need facts, not fake news. People can use the internet to portray a certain perspective of events to the public. We need to bear that in mind in assessing the impact of the situation in Catalonia on Europe as a whole. Respect for the democratic process must be the winner. The Minister said that in any democracy political developments must be placed within a legal framework, which is a fundamental requirement, not a procedural point because if the rights of all citizens are to be protected, respect for the rule of law, its possibilities, protections and limits is an obligation, not a choice. I agree with that. I also note that the Minister said we can disagree with the law and work to change it but we cannot ignore or act beyond it. On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, comprising Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and me among others, I hope an outcome to the crisis can be reached sooner rather than later. Perhaps a fellow Tipperary man, former Member of the House, former diplomat and iarSheanadóir, Dr. Martin Mansergh, could help because he has gone to many parts of the world, was very involved in the peace process in Northern Ireland, as members of Sinn Féin will acknowledge, and is respected by all sides. We need people with cool heads and those who will respect the law and ensure there is a culture of respect for the law by all sides and people. I hope the Minister will be able to lend his support to that. Ireland is a peace-loving nation that has contributed peacekeepers and other services all over the world and it will be able to help in some way. Catalonia will, hopefully, return to peace, a solution and a bóthar díreach amach of the impasse will be found and Catalans will be able to get back to raising their families and carrying out their work in a peaceful, pragmatic manner while respecting the values of all sides.

We must be careful in terms of giving advice and taking sides because of the details, complexity and the passions on various sides of the argument in Catalonia and Spain. If outsiders were discussing our future sovereignty or the management of our constitutional affairs we would be very sensitive to a lack of understanding of that complexity. I reiterate the advice of European Green Party leaders such as Philippe Lamberts, MEP, who said earlier today that the European Union, of which Ireland is a member and the relevant council of which the Minister is a member, should seek to promote mediation as best it can rather than taking sides. That can only be done if parties are not seen to have a pre-conceived notion of how the mediation will go before entering it. Aware of the need for calm heads, we are looking for the Spanish Government to refrain from suspending Catalonian autonomy and in turn calling on the Catalan Parliament to refrain from declaring unilateral independence and for its leadership to return to the Senate session in Madrid which is to take place this Thursday or Friday to open the possibility of dialogue. If the leaders of the Catalan Administration went to that session there is a good chance the Spanish Prime Minister would also attend and the process of dialogue that is clearly needed would be started. I read the Minister's speech with interest and agree with his fundamental argument that one has to respect constitutional rights and the law. Irish people understand how the loss of respect for the law can signal approaching national self-determination. It is interesting that during the War of Independence or the wider process of seeking independence from Britain the real moment of independence was not the use of physical force but, rather, when we set up our own constitutional courts. That was when there was a defining sense that British rule no longer applied because we did not recognise or respect their law. Irish people also recognise that process began when the public responded to physical violence by the British state, which accelerated the process towards not recognising the constitutional right of the British Government to have any influence on our determination. In that context, I join other Members in recognising the obvious but important point that the exercise of violence by the Spanish police during the referendum in Catalonia was a very self-defeating action. All Members understand how that can inflame matters and change the sense of what is constitutionally correct. Deputy Darragh O'Brien suggested that elections might be part of the process of calming matters down. Elections may form part of the imposition of the article 155 process by the Spanish Government. Opposition leaders in the Catalan Parliament are similarly calling for elections as a way of trying to maintain a democratic process and stepping back from confrontation. That is a possible mechanism. I stand by the use of referendums even though they are difficult procedures at the best of times. They are not just the tool of the dictator as some have recently called them in public commentary.My understanding is that there have been two referendums in Catalonia in recent years, both of which gave similar results in that approximately 2 million out of the 5.4 million registered voters voted for independence. Those opposed to independence argued at the time that supporters of their position should not turn up to vote. In these circumstances one runs into difficulties. Perhaps elections could be used as a way to find an alternative avenue for the wishes of the people in Catalonia on both sides of the independence argument in order that they have a voice and a level of representation which would be renewed on the basis of what has happened in the past few months. We can only imagine the repercussions this has had among the population of the area. Regarding the issue of referenda, the turnout and so on, it is interesting that this is occurring at a time when in some ways there is a questioning of our country's constitutional referendums. The reason the Good Friday Agreement referendum was so significant is that there was a turnout of 81% in the North and that 71%, a clear majority which had to reflect in some ways a significant proportion of both traditions in the North, supported the Agreement. I am nervous about the Taoiseach's commentary on this in recent times. People say it reflects on what the exact application of the Good Friday Agreement might be. I am just making the point that one must be careful about the interpretation or use of referendums and reflect on the numbers involved. Again I cite the example of the Good Friday Agreement; the turnout was relatively low in our jurisdiction. It was approximately 56%. That would probably be slightly higher than average for a normal referendum, but the fact that it was a 94% vote in favour of the Good Friday Agreement was hugely significant in allowing us to advance the peace process because there was such consensus. I use these examples to make the point that elections at this time could provide some space for mediation and dialogue rather than just an attritional fight between the Spanish Government and the Catalonian Administration. I return to the simple call from the European Green Party. We have a very strong party in Catalonia, and our Spanish colleagues are very well known to us. As a European party, we are looking on and our key message is: step back from the brink, allow dialogue to occur, go to the Senate in Madrid in the coming days, step back from suspending Catalan autonomy, step back from the declaration of unilateral independence and, in a way that is hard for us to foresee and, as I said, would be wrong for us to pre-empt, whatever the outcome, try to slow this moment down to a moment of dialogue and discussion rather than a clash between the two sides in this incredibly complex and important debate.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	309	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." When I made my Budget Statement in this House two weeks ago, I said this was a budget to safeguard our national finances and to help rebalance our economy. It was a budget to promote fairness and provide for modest but sustainable improvements in the lives of those we serve. Many of the measures to help us achieve these goals are contained in the Finance Bill 2017, which we will begin to discuss today. The Bill is the means by which we will legislate to ensure these changes happen. Before I go through its sections in detail, I would like to look at some of the overarching themes contained therein. In budget 2018 I am continuing to fulfil the Government's commitment to make steady and sustainable progress in reducing the income tax burden, with a particular focus on low and middle-income earners. I have been clear that my intention is to preserve a broad and stable income tax base. Therefore, to ensure that I do not narrow the tax base, the universal social charge, USC, measures to be introduced in this Finance Bill focus on reductions to USC rates, while also maintaining the current entry threshold to the USC of €13,000. I am also establishing a working group to plan, over the coming year, the process of amalgamating USC and PRSI over the medium term. It is my intention that, throughout this process, the income threshold of €13,000 will be maintained as the general point of entry to the new amalgamated system. A key objective of the group and of mine, as Minister for Finance, is that we do not narrow the tax base but ensure our personal taxation code is both competitive and resilient in the future. In this Finance Bill I am reducing the 2.5% USC rate to 2% and reducing the 5% rate of USC to 4.75%, with the result that the top marginal rate of tax on income up to €70,044 will fall to 48.75%. It is the fourth budget in succession in which this marginal rate has been reduced. I am also introducing a small but important increase to the ceiling of the second USC rate band, from €18,772 to €19,372. This ensures that the salary of a full-time worker on the increased minimum wage of €9.55 per hour will remain outside the higher rates of USC. Finally, I have also extended, for a further two years, the relief from the higher rates of USC which is available to medical card holders with income up to €60,000. The point at which an income earner enters into the higher 40% rate of income tax will rise next year by €750.This will increase the entry point for single taxpayers from €33,800 to €34,550 and for married-one-earner families from €42,800 to €43,550. I am conscious of the challenges facing small and growing businesses around the country due to the changing international environment. I am introducing two measures in this Finance Bill to support this vital and vibrant sector. First, building on the progress made in the last two budgets, I am providing for a €200 increase in the earned income credit, bringing it to €1,150 per year from 2018. This increase will be of benefit to more than 147,000 self-employed individuals generating economic activity across the country. Second, research has shown that employee financial participation can be effective in increasing competitiveness and helping companies to attract and retain staff in a competitive labour market. This Bill, therefore, provides the details of the new key employee engagement programme announced in budget 2018, which will support small to medium enterprises in their efforts to attract and retain key employees in a competitive international labour market. This scheme will facilitate small to medium enterprises in providing key employees with a financial incentive, in the form of share options, linked to the success of the company. In support of the climate action strategy set out in Ireland’s national mitigation plan, the Bill provides for a 0% rate of benefit-in-kind on electric vehicles. While this relief is provided for an initial period of one year, it is my intention that the zero rate will remain in place for a period, a minimum of three to five years, sufficient to incentivise the uptake of electric vehicles, EVs. A comprehensive review of benefit-in-kind on vehicles will take place in 2018 and it is expected that this review will set out proposals for longer-term benefit-in-kind relief for electric vehicles, as well as informing decisions for budget 2019 more broadly. To further support this measure I am exempting electricity used in the workplace for charging vehicles from benefit-in-kind. I am also introducing a number of measures in support of public health. As announced in the budget I am introducing a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks in April of next year, subject to approval from the European Commission, to coincide with the introduction of a similar tax in the UK. The tax will apply to non-alcoholic, water-based and juice-based drinks that have an added sugar content of 5 g per 100 ml and above. Sugar-sweetened drinks with less than 5 g of sugar per 100 ml will be outside the scope of the tax. If the sugar content is 5 g or more but less than 8 g per 100 ml, a tax of 20 cent per litre will apply. Sugar-sweetened drinks with a sugar content of 8 g or more will have a rate of 30 cent per litre. The introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks will contribute to the broader public health strategy to tackle obesity levels in Ireland, particularly among younger people. Since the announcement of the tax in budget 2017 there are indications that manufacturers of sugar-sweetened drinks are reformulating their products to avoid the tax. This is to be welcomed and is a sign that this measure is having a positive effect even before its introduction. I have also increased the VAT rate on sunbed sessions from 13.5% to 23% in line with the Government's national cancer strategy. In 2011, stamp duty was reduced on non-residential property to 2% to encourage investment. It was successful and that sector in particular is recovering strongly again and it is now opportune to increase the rate to encourage our economy to focus resources elsewhere. For budget 2018, I announced an increase in the stamp duty rate for all non-residential property transactions, including agricultural land, from 2% to 6%. To encourage the development of residential homes, a refund scheme will be introduced where certain criteria are met and I will provide full details of this measure on Committee Stage. I am mindful that non-residential property includes agricultural land and of how this measure impacts on the farming community, particularly families. The Bill provides for certain measures the address this. First, as announced on budget day, I am extending consanguinity relief for another three years and I am fixing the stamp duty rate applying under that scheme at 1%. In addition I have decided the age rule for the consanguinity relief will be removed. This will be revisited again when the measure comes up for review towards the end of 2020. This means that it will be possible for all gifts and sales of farmlands to closely-related family members who do not qualify for the 100% exemption available under the young trained farmer scheme to benefit from consanguinity relief at a stamp duty rate of 1%, thereby protecting the position of succession within farm families. I will now take Members through the Finance Bill but Deputies will appreciate that in the limited time available to me I cannot describe every single section in as much detail as I might like. Part 1 of the Bill deals with universal social charge, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 provide for the changes I have mentioned. Section 6 provides for the tapered extension of mortgage interest relief for existing recipients for three years. Section 7 deals with benefit-in-kind on electric vehicles. Section 8 inserts a new section, section 112AA, into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This section provides that where an employee of a health or dental insurer or of a tied health insurance agent receives a health or dental insurance policy in the course of his or her employment, any discount received on the policy shall be a taxable emolument for the employee. Section 10 introduces the key employee engagement programme, KEEP. Section 11 relates to the scheme for accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment. The accelerated capital allowance scheme is designed to improve energy efficiency among Irish companies and sole traders and to assist Ireland in meeting its national targets. I am extending the end date of the scheme to 31 December 2020. Section 12 provides that pre-letting expenses incurred on residential premises that were vacant for 12 months or more may be allowed as a deduction against rental income from those premises. This is a time-limited relief and the relief will be clawed back if the property ceases to be let within four years. Section 14 makes two amendments to the tax treatment of life assurance funds. The first amendment provides that where the life policy is assigned to a section 110 company which has acquired the mortgage, it will not trigger an exit tax charge. This change mirrors the treatment of the assignment of a life policy as security for a debt to a financial institution. The second amendment provides that where the life company incurs foreign tax in respect of its policyholder business, the life company may not claim double tax relief for that tax against the Irish tax arising on its non-policyholder business. Section 15 provides for investment undertakings to supply financial statements annually to the Revenue Commissioners. It is proposed to require for the financial statements to be in iXBRL, which is a computer language that allows the presentation of financial information in a computer-readable format and which allows for more effective risk analysis by Revenue. This is in line with the format that most companies are required to use. This will be brought in on a phased basis through regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners, with my consent. Section 16 makes a number of technical amendments to the Irish real estate fund, IREF, regime introduced by the Finance Act 2016. In line with the treatment of other pension funds, this section provides that IREFs need not operate withholding tax on payments to approved retirement funds, approved minimum retirement funds and vested personal retirement savings accounts. I also wish to flag to the House that I intend to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage regarding the five-year capital gains tax exemption for IREFs. The amendments also clarify that sub-funds may make a declaration in respect of unit holdings in other sub-funds of the same umbrella scheme and they provide for advance clearance procedures to deal with a situation where a full refund of any tax withheld would be made. The section also provides for EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID, regulated intermediaries to make a declaration on behalf of pension funds, charities and credit unions. Section 17 makes a minor amendment to section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to include shares that derive their value from Irish land in the definition of specified mortgages. The ability of companies which are taxed in accordance with section 110 to deduct interest against their Irish property profits was restricted in the Finance Act 2016. This section expands the type of Irish property profits to which that restriction applies. Section 18 is a technical amendment to the loss relief provisions that apply where a company has claimed relief under the knowledge development box, KDB. It ensures that the amount of relief that can be claimed for a loss incurred in the KDB trade cannot be greater than the loss itself.At present, the legislation restricts the amount of loss which can be offset against other income and fails to reduce the amount of the loss which can then be carried forward. A technical amendment is required to repair this unintended consequence. Section 19 makes a number of amendments to section 76A of the Taxes Consolidation Act relating to the replacement of former Irish GAAP with current Irish GAAP accounting standards. Section 20 amends section 247 of the Taxes Consolidation Act to provide for relief for interest on a loan used to acquire, or in certain circumstances lend to, a holding company that indirectly holds ordinary shares in a trading company through one or more intermediate holding companies. Section 247 of the Taxes Consolidation Act currently provides relief for interest where the loan is applied in acquiring or lending to a holding company that holds shares directly in a trading company. The changes introduced by this section have been operated administratively by the Revenue Commissioners. The changes reflect and clarify the extent to which the administrative practice has been operated. As a result of the changes to section 247, consequential changes have been made to sections 243 and 249 also. The changes to section 249 ensure that an investing company will be deemed to recover capital where, subject to exceptions, an intermediate holding company recovers capital from another company. Section 21 provides for the budget day announcement regarding an 80% limit on the quantum of relevant income against which capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense may be deducted in a tax year. This will ensure some smoothing of corporation tax receipts over time. Sections 22, 23 and 24 provide for amendments to be made to sections 29, 626B and 980, respectively, of the Taxes Consolidation Act. These sections are being amended to address certain capital gains tax and corporation tax avoidance practices that Revenue has identified and which are being addressed in the Bill. Section 25 proposes an amendment to section 604B of the Taxes Consolidation Act regarding relief for farm restructuring. The European Commission has introduced requirements for the publication on a central website of details of any state aid granted on or after 1 July 2016, if it exceeds certain thresholds. Currently, Revenue is not in a position to publish this information in the case of the CGT farm restructuring relief, as the existing legislation does not require the necessary information to be collected as part of tax returns in order to have it supplied to the Commission. This is being corrected by these proposed amendments to 604B. Section 26 provides for an amendment to extend the availability of capital gains tax group relief to companies in countries with which Ireland has a double tax agreement. This amendment puts capital gains tax groups on an equal footing with loss groups and will legislate for existing Revenue practice. Section 27 provides exemptions from capital gains tax for those availing of compensation under the 2017 voluntary home owner relocation scheme administered by the OPW. Section 28 provides for changes to section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, known as the seven-year CGT relief. As I announced in budget 2018, I propose that, subject to this amendment, any eligible asset purchased in the qualifying period, which ran from 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2014, can be sold at any time between the fourth and seventh anniversary of its purchase and enjoy a full relief from CGT. Sales made before the fourth anniversary will receive no relief, while sales made after the seventh anniversary will continue to enjoy the tapering relief previously provided for. This measure will contribute to a freeing up of development land and residential properties purchased in the qualifying period, the sale of which might otherwise have been delayed until the seventh anniversary of their purchase. Sections 29 and 64 address my budget announcement that I intend to allow the leasing of agricultural land for solar panels to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity for the purposes of specific capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax reliefs with certain conditions. Agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax and retirement relief from capital gains tax will be amended to allow solar panels on agricultural land to be considered qualifying assets for these reliefs. The amount of farmland that can be used for solar panels will be restricted to 50% of the total farm holding. This condition is to ensure that genuine agricultural activity will continue to be carried out on the farm, thereby maintaining the overall objective of agricultural relief in particular. Sections 30 to 42 and Schedule 4 give effect to the tax on sugar. Section 44 gives effect to the increase in the rates of tobacco products tax. Section 46 will make two minor amendments to substitute fuels legislation introduced in the Finance Act 2016 to ensure consistency and protect the revenue base by clarifying that a relevant product is "a substitute fuel or an additive". Section 47 amends the diesel rebate scheme to ensure that a qualifying road transport operator, who is regarded as an undertaking in difficulty, is not eligible for the tax refund. This measure is to ensure compatibility with state aid guidelines. Section 48 will amend the definition of a category A and B vehicle and insert a new bodywork code definition so that the preferential rate intended for commercial vehicles will be restricted to those vehicles that are genuinely used for commercial purposes. Section 49 will ensure that the amount of VRT repaid under the export repayment scheme cannot exceed the amount of VRT originally paid on the vehicle at import. Section 51 increases the VAT rate on sunbed services from 13.5% to 23% from 1 January 2018. Section 52 updates the VAT exemption on education services to ensure that all bona fide vocational training and retraining continues to be exempt from VAT. Section 55 amends section 1 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to give effect to a number of measures. The rate of stamp duty applicable to conveyances and transfers of non-residential property is increased from 2% to 6%. Transitional provisions apply for purchasers with binding contracts in place before budget day 11 October and where the instruments for the transfers are executed before 1 January 2018. I have already outlined the changes in relation to consanguinity relief. In relation to residential leases, the threshold above which leases are chargeable to stamp duty is increased from the current €30,000 to €40,000 per annum. This higher threshold should ensure that the vast majority of renters will not be liable to stamp duty. Section 56 makes a number of technical amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to align that Act with the other tax Acts in relation to the delegation of functions to Revenue officials. Section 57 provides that the Housing Agency will be exempt from stamp duty on land or buildings purchased or leased. Section 58 makes two amendments to stamp duty reliefs for young trained farmers which are designed to take account of EU state aid requirements. The first amendment places on a statutory footing the conditions that a young trained farmer must submit a business plan to Teagasc and must come within the EU Commission definition of "micro, small and medium enterprises". The second amendment allows Revenue to provide information to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to an exemption from stamp duty on leases on farmland. This information is required for compliance with EU regulations.

The Companies Act 2014, which came into effect on 1 June 2015, consolidated and amended existing company law statutes. The main changes affecting the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999 and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 related to company structures and the new streamlined procedures for the merger and division of companies. The Finance Bill also provides for updating the referencing in the Taxes Acts and the insertion of provisions in the Taxes Acts to ensure that the intended tax consequences of a merger or division under the Companies Act 2014 are provided for and do not have an unintended impact. This is addressed by means of sections 59, 60, 73,74 and 75. Section 62 of Part 5 of the Bill provides for an amendment to section 85 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003. That section of that Act already provides for a CAT exemption on the inheritance of certain retirement funds to prevent a double tax charge on the same event, that is, income tax and CAT where the inheritance is taken by a child who is over 21 years of age. Section 85 now needs to be amended to remove the potential for such a double charge in the case of personal retirement savings accounts and retirement annuity accounts that were not vested on the death of the disponer after the age of 75.Section 63 makes a number of minor amendments to the dwelling house exemption from capital acquisitions tax. The changes clarify that, first, a liability to inheritance tax will not be triggered where a donor dies within two years of making a gift to a dependent relative and, second, in the case of both gifts and inheritances, to qualify for the exemption, a property transferring to a dependent relative does not need to be the principal private residence of the disposer. This is in line with policy changes made to the operation of the dwelling house exemption in last year's Finance Act. I have described section 64 with section 29. The final Part, Part 6, deals with miscellaneous matters. Section 66 makes a technical amendment to section 122 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, TCA, to ensure the provision operates as intended and to prevent certain tax avoidance opportunities in respect of employer-provided loans. Section 67 and Schedule 3 make minor amendments to a number of appeals-related provisions in the TCA. Section 69 provides for a number of largely technical changes relating to the PAYE modernisation project. It is the most significant review of the PAYE system since its introduction in the 1960s and will result in a move to a real-time PAYE system from January 2019. Section 71 introduces two amendments to the domicile levy legislation found in section 531AA of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The amendments proposed ensure, first, that capital allowances and losses are not allowed as a deduction for the purpose of the world-wide income test. Second, there is a technical amendment to delete the term "final decision" from section 531AA as it conflicts with section 531AC of that Act on "Credit for income tax paid". These amendments will strengthen the legislation, thus reducing the number of domicile levy appeals and improving compliance, as well as serving to protect tax revenue. Section 72 is the first step in the legislative procedure required to give effect in Irish law to the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, multilateral instrument. Ireland signed the instrument on 7 June 2017 along with more than 60 other countries. The instrument provides a mechanism for countries to transpose recommendations made by the OECD BEPS project into existing bilateral tax treaties. Further legal steps will be needed before Ireland's ratification of the instrument is completed and these steps can begin once this Bill is enacted. A small number of matters are still under consideration, which I may bring forward on Committee Stage. I will, of course, also give consideration to the suggestions put forward during our debate over the next few days and in the context of the Finance Bill process and discussions generally.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	312	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is important to recall the backdrop to the budget. Election 2016 left Dáil Éireann in an uncertain state of affairs with no clear mandate for any party to govern but it was clear that the people resolutely rejected the right-wing policies of the previous Government. They did not want tax cuts at the expense of investment in vital public services. We recognised our responsibility as a party to ensure the country was provided with a stable government and it was in this context that we negotiated the confidence and supply agreement. The agreement ensures a stable government and a 2:1 split at least between investment in public services and tax cuts. This is the second budget in which this overarching requirement has been achieved, yet the agreement is much more than a ratio between investment in public services and tax reductions as it goes much deeper than that. It is because of the agreement that changes to the USC were directed at lower and middle income earners, that pensions and other social welfare payments have been increased for the second successive year and that there will be more investment in health care, in particular, mental health, an area deprived of much attention for many years. Yet again, the agreement has made this budget a fairer and more progressive one. It is by no means a perfect budget and many of the changes are only incremental and certainly modest but without the influence of Fianna Fáil, it would not have been as progressive. However, there are fundamental challenges that demand delivery and not spin. Before turning to the tax measures in the legislation, it has to be pointed out that under the watch of both this Government and the previous one, the crises in housing and health care continue to worsen. Almost 700,000 patients are on some form of hospital waiting list and more than 8,000 people are homeless, including over 3,000 children. These statistics are a stain on our society but behind them are real people who are still failing to experience the economic recovery that we all welcome. The Government has consistently published report after report and press release after press release on housing, yet there has been precious little action on the ground. There has been a blatant lack of attention to social and affordable housing. We welcome the moves on social housing in the budget but they will not make up for the damage done by decisions made in the past. We do not need another report; we need more action in respect of the delivery of social and affordable housing throughout the country. We also welcome the €55 million increase for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in the health sector to reduce waiting lists. When the confidence and supply agreement was being negotiated, this measure was opposed but it now seems to be the centrepiece of the health care strategy. The headline figures for the economy are positive. Economic growth is up and unemployment is down. GDP increased by 5.2% last year and it is expected to increase by 4.3% this year and 3.5% next year. While these figures are undoubtedly positive, they must be treated with a degree of caution. They can obscure the many serious issues people face in their daily lives, they can obscure the issues I mentioned in housing and health and they can obscure the still-pervasive mortgage arrears crisis while the prospect of a hard Brexit hangs over us. On the fiscal side, it is vital that we meet the medium-term objective in 2018. It is not legally required but it is the right thing to do. We need our finances to be on a stable footing into the future. I turn to the announcements on budget day, which are reflected in the Bill. On income tax, we welcome the increase in the tax band for individuals earning more than €33,800 and commensurate with that single income families on a higher level. However, we only welcome it in the context of reductions in the USC which will be directed at lower and middle-income earners. This is consistent with the confidence and supply agreement and this is what we stuck to during the negotiations. It would have been unpalatable for us as a party if the tax reductions were solely focused on increasing the entry point to the higher tax rate. While increasing the entry point will only affect those earning more than €33,800, the cuts to the USC will affect more than 1.8 million people earning more than €13,000 per annum. Though the measures are certainly modest, cutting the 2.5% and 5% rates of USC is the fairest option to take. Through them, we have ensured the budget will be far more progressive than it otherwise would have been. Taken with last year's reductions in tax, the effect on people's disposable income will be significant. While some may scoff at the weekly gain from them, I assure the House it is not insignificant for many. For a family facing higher rents and insurance and child care costs, the combined effect of the tax reductions will be a modest help, but a help nonetheless. There are those who argue there should be no tax cuts at all but I remind the House that in 2007 some 2.156 million workers paid €13.6 billion in income tax while in 2017 some 2.063 million workers will pay more than €20 billion. Therefore, 100,000 fewer workers are paying €6.6 billion more in income tax now. It is clear that income tax payers need sustainable and progressive relief from the burden placed on them during the economic crisis and the necessary budgetary correction that occurred over the past number of years. Some people argue that the higher paid should pay even higher taxes but Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax systems in Europe and the OECD. This is as it should be. People who earn more should contribute more but applying more taxes to individuals earning in excess of a threshold of, say, €100,000, which is often quoted, would only serve to discourage investment and job creation. Colleagues should not take our word for that; they should take the word of those who are marketing Ireland as a destination for further investment.At a time when we face a crisis in our health service, penalising medical staff with highly sought-after specialised skills will only compound the problems we face in that sector. Tax hikes would cripple any chance of attracting more foreign direct investment and attracting and retaining key personnel across important sectors of our economy. I am glad that we have seen movement in this budget on the home carer tax credit. This will impact on nearly 81,000 households. Caring for a loved one, as thousands of stay-at-home parents and carers who care for people with disabilities or infirmities choose to do, is a key part of any functioning and just society. It is only right that we reward these people for the vital role they play. Again, I call on Revenue to undertake some form of awareness campaign to bring this tax credit to the attention of the many people who I believe are entitled to it but who are not claiming it. We welcome the improvement in respect of the earned income tax credit. While it is disappointing that it was not fully equalised with the PAYE tax credit, it is moving in the right direction nonetheless and will impact on nearly 150,000 self-employed workers throughout the country. It cannot be right that, on the one hand, we want to encourage enterprise and job creation yet, on the other, we tax the self-employed unfairly. We must work over the coming years to fully equalise the taxation treatment of the self-employed with that of PAYE workers. This is an objective to which I commit our party. Similarly, we are encouraged by the introduction of the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, a share-based remuneration scheme, in the budget. If set up correctly, this scheme will enable smaller companies in particular to retain key employees who are essential for them to grow. We hope this scheme will be given approval under state aid rules and can be set up speedily in order that companies might participate in it. The Minister might provide an update on the state aid approval process and on when this measure will become operational. We are disappointed that there has been no move on the CGT lifetime limit for entrepreneurs, particularly in the context of Brexit. This is potentially a vital tax relief to encourage enterprise and growth in our economy, particularly in areas of highly mobile investment, and it will have to be addressed in upcoming budgets. Similar entrepreneurs in the UK can earn up to £10 million over their lifetimes and be taxed at 10%, while the threshold here remains at €1 million. We welcome the continuation of mortgage interest relief, albeit at a tapered rate. Mortgage arrears continue to be a major issue, with nearly 32,000 families in arrears of more than two years. For them and others like them, there is little light at the end of the tunnel. Ultimately, this will lead to more court proceedings and more repossessions unless we continue to reform the process of dealing with mortgage arrears and tilt the balance in favour of those who are trying hard to keep their family homes. As we know, the mortgage-to-rent scheme has been woefully inadequate in dealing with this crisis to date, with fewer than 300 cases completed. Tomorrow morning, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I will introduce for legislative scrutiny a Fianna Fáil Bill that aims to tackle serious mortgage arrears cases. The Bill passed Second Stage and is now commencing scrutiny. I urge everyone in the House to get behind the Bill, which, essentially, would remove the bank veto in cases involving principal dwelling homes or family mortgages. It was in this context that Fianna Fáil committed in the lead-up to last year’s election to extend mortgage interest relief beyond its current end date of December 2017. Due to our influence, we secured that measure in the confidence and supply agreement, resulting in this budgetary measure whereby the relief will be extended, albeit on a tapered basis, for a further period of three years rather than ending overnight at the end of this year, which is the existing legal position. As we know, mortgage interest relief provides tax relief at source to people who purchased their homes between 2004 and 2012 when house prices had peaked. These are the people who are most likely to be still affected by negative equity, where the loan outstanding exceeds the value of the house or apartment. These people cannot move to a more sustainable solution by moving to a more affordable home because they are trapped. The average annual relief to each of the near 300,000 mortgage accounts is approximately €600 currently. I welcome that it will not end completely at the end of 2017. The bedrock of our industrial policy is our competitive corporation tax regime. Not only do we have the exceptionally competitive 12.5% rate but we also have the research and development tax credit and the knowledge development box. Currently, foreign multinational companies employ approximately 200,000 people in Ireland. This is altogether aside from the indirect jobs created in domestic companies that rely on multinational business to grow and prosper. In recent times, there has been increased focus on our corporation tax regime from both Europe and the US. On the one hand, we see many countries, including the UK, reducing their rates, with others such as the US promising to do so. On the other hand, we have seen the revival of the common consolidated corporate tax base proposal from the European Union. This proposal would harmonise corporation tax throughout the European Union and, if implemented, will serve to narrow our base. Fianna Fáil resolutely opposes any such move from Europe and Ireland needs to be very clear that, under the Lisbon treaty, corporation tax policy is the competence of sovereign member states. We must continue with the BEPS programme that we signed up to through the OECD and we must work with our European partners in a constructive and positive way to make corporation tax policy throughout Europe more transparent. In this context, Fianna Fáil welcomes the publication of the Coffey report. This is an extensive report on a highly complex area of tax and Fianna Fáil welcomes the public consultation exercise now under way in respect of a number of the recommendations made by Mr. Coffey. We look forward to contributing to the debate on these issues. The Minister announced in the budget a move to limit the amount of income that can be offset by capital allowances on intangible assets and we welcome those proposals. Provision for this is made in the Bill. The global corporation tax environment is changing rapidly and, as I have outlined, our tax policy is being challenged in a variety of ways. We must continue as a country to be ahead of the game. We cannot afford to take a back seat and watch these changes unfold. We must play an active role on the world stage, in Europe and in the OECD. Brexit is the single biggest threat facing Ireland, both economically and politically. Economically, we have all seen the depreciation of sterling against the euro and how this is making Irish goods more expensive relative to British goods. This issue is particularly acute in the Border region already and has manifested in online shopping. The fall in the value of sterling has already had a notable impact on the tourism sector. While overall tourism numbers are up, the number of those travelling from the UK is down. UK tourists are spending less time and less money here. We agree with the decision to maintain the lower 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector. While the tourism sector appears very strong in Dublin, in many other parts of the country it is nowhere near as strong. I want to make it clear that Fianna Fáil resolutely opposes any return to a hard border between the North and the Republic. We have consistently held this position since the Brexit vote despite what some Members and, indeed, individuals in our own party and others might say. While it is ultimately a decision for the UK, we still believe it is in the best interests of all concerned that the UK remains within the customs union. While this may not turn out to be the case, we all must work to avoid a hard Brexit. A reversion to WTO rules would spell disaster for Ireland, particularly for the agrifood sector where tariffs of up to 40% could be charged on our exports. We need a detailed sector-by-sector analysis and we must not shy away from considering the implications of a hard Brexit, which we do not want to see happen, but this is by no means an unlikely outcome and we must be prepared for it. The Taoiseach argues that this will serve only to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. We heard no such argument when the Department of Finance undertook a sectoral analysis of the economy and the impacts of Brexit on it. I heard no such argument when the ESRI published its analysis of what a hard Brexit might look like. Indeed, I recall debating these issues openly with the previous Minister for Finance on how Revenue was preparing for Brexit. These were and are important reports. They have influenced the debate on Brexit and how we respond to it. Simply put, I cannot see how withholding reports that have already been completed informs the debate on Brexit. We believe Northern Ireland should be designated a special economic zone and that state aid rules should be relaxed in certain areas and sectors most affected by Brexit. In that light, we welcome the setting up of a Brexit lending fund for SMEs and we hope it is approved on state aid grounds by the European Commission.The key revenue raising measure in this budget is the increase in non-residential stamp duty from 2% to 6%. This measure was not outlined in the confidence and supply agreement and broadly Fianna Fáil is in favour of it. It certainly can be argued that the commercial construction sector is growing at an exceptional pace and it is directing scarce and vital resources away from the residential construction sector to build and provide the homes we need for our people. However, the proposal raises concerns. First and foremost is the estimated extra revenue from this measure in 2018. It is expected that €376 million will be received through this measure. The budget is based on this premise. This estimate is based on 2016 and 2017 values and volumes and if they do not perform to the same level the Exchequer may be left short in 2018. It is a risk which has to be highlighted. Another concern is its effect on the agricultural sector and I welcome the moves the Minister has made in this regard, particularly the changes to the consanguinity relief. Housing is the most acute issue facing our society. The increase in house prices and rents is pushing more and more people into emergency accommodation. House prices have increased by over 12% in the past 12 months and rents have increased by close to 12%. The State needs to step in. We welcome the extra funding for social housing but it does not go far enough. Social housing provision was gutted in recent years and there is a long way to go before it can be fully restored. We welcome the new fund which is being established and which we debated earlier during Oral Questions to the Minister for Finance for the provision of debt finance to the private sector for the construction of new homes. That is an important measure. We have consistently called for the establishment of a vacant site tax, a tax on vacant property will tend to lower the price of that property and make it more affordable for residential development. We hope the measures announced in the budget will tackle the land hoarding issue. There is a lot more work to be done in that regard and we will discuss it on Committee Stage.  The moves on sugar tax for soft drinks and an increase in tax on tobacco are positive, as is the increase in VAT on sunbeds. The Minister did mention EU state aid approval for the sugar tax. Given that the deadline is quite tight for implementing this measure, he might update the House on that issue and say what stage that approval process is at. There are positive initiatives in this Finance Bill on electric vehicles and changing the taxation treatment from a benefit-in-kind perspective. We very much welcome that.  Fianna Fáil will stand by the commitments we made in the confidence and supply agreement. We did that last year and we intend to do the same this year but we will engage in robust debate throughout the course of this Bill and we will bring forward proposals on it. The agreement has made this budget a fairer and more progressive one. What we need on the key issues facing our society now is action, particularly on housing and health. I look forward on Committee Stage to going into a detailed section-by-section analysis of the measures set out in the Finance Bill 2017 and will contribute as positively as I can to that debate.

Sílim go bhfuil an Bille seo lochtach mar gheall ar an dearcadh atá ag an Rialtas agus ag Fianna Fáil, atá ag tabhairt tacaíochta don Rialtas an Bille Airgeadais seo a thabhairt tríd na Tithe. Is é an dearcadh sin ná go bhfuil sé ceart agus cóir go mbeadh muid ag gearradh na céadta milliún euro i gcánacha agus géarchéim mhillteanach os ár gcomhair ó thaobh tithíochta de, agus daoine gan tithe, agus ó thaobh chúrsaí sláinte de, agus othair ina luí ar thralaithe agus othair ann nach bhfuil ábalta fáil isteach chuig na hospidéil agus iad ar liosta feithimh fada. Sin an fáth nach mbeidh ár bpáirtí ag tabhairt tacaíochta don Bhille Airgeadais seo i mbliana. The Finance Bill, like the budget, is deeply flawed. The fixation on personal tax cuts at a time of crisis in our public services is inexcusable. I heard Deputy Michael McGrath talk about the level of personal income tax we are paying compared with 2007 and I am not sure whether he wants us to return to the unsustainable period of 2007, the boom and bust where his party year after year supported cuts to personal taxation and drove this economy into the ground. We all know this. It is not distant memory, it is real for many families who still have loved ones in different parts of the world as a result of that party's stewardship of the economy at that time. I really fear that this Minister is doing the same again. He is doing it at the expense of public services which are crying out for investment in areas such as health and housing. It is no good coming into this Chamber and saying we want a budget that will support investment in housing and health and deciding to strip away resources worth hundreds of millions of euro with cuts to income tax and universal social charge, USC.  That USC and income tax cuts of €335 million are being made at a time when we have a housing emergency and a health service that is creaking at the seams is inexcusable. My party is opposed to this Bill as it implements a budget that is not good enough for the country in 2018. The main part of the budget as far as the Government is concerned is the cuts in personal tax. The same Government Deputies will come in here at Christmas when people are freezing on our streets or our hospitals have crashed under the winter pressure and they will decry the crises and call for action. I ask all those Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Independent Deputies to leave their crocodile tears at the front gate when those days come, as they inevitably will. By supporting this budget and this Finance Bill, with its tax cuts, they are making those days inevitable. Let us be clear on that at least, passing this Finance Bill means no new houses additional to those promised by the former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, over a year ago. It also means a real cut to the health service when inflation, demographic pressures and other issues are taken into account. The Finance Bill is about the details but we cannot divorce it from the big choices that it represents. Even in terms of the details it fails and there are major omissions and gaps that need to be addressed. We often talk about loopholes in Finance Bills. For me it is not a loophole, it is a policy choice. As I said on budget night, one of the flagship announcements, the crackdown on multinationals that have onshored intellectual property worth hundreds of billions of euro here over recent years, using these as write-offs against their profits, is flawed. The result of the change is that a multinational is no longer able to completely wipe out its company's tax liability. However, as drafted, the Finance Bill would apply this cap only to assets onshored from 11 October this year. That means the hundreds of billions of euro transferred here in recent years, especially in 2015, can be still be used by companies to potentially neutralise their entire corporation tax bill. This is totally unacceptable and in this regard I welcome the recent comment from Mr. Seamus Coffey, the author of the report produced on behalf of the Government. He asks why the Government's new cap on the write-down of intangible assets should not apply to all assets, as opposed to the Government's proposal, which "grandfathers" the new measure, meaning that the 80% cap will apply only to intangible assets acquired post-budget. Due to the proposed cap's not applying to all intangible assets, the State could be missing out on a huge amount of corporate tax revenue, which might not materialise in the future.  Mr. Seamus Coffey notes that if the cap applied to all claims, existing and new, then the additional corporation tax to be collected in 2018 could be up to €1 billion using the 2015 figure published by the Revenue Commissioners and estimates from that time used by the Department of Finance, as opposed to the €150 million that the Government expects to raise through the grandfathered measure. If we applied it to all intangible assets we would be talking about €1 billion of additional taxation and would that not be nice to have to try to address the concerns and problems we have in health, education, housing and homelessness and other areas? We are paying for these onshored assets because they count towards our gross national income, GNI, which is pushing up our EU contribution. We are letting these companies pay no tax through their intangible asset write-downs and the State is picking up the tab by way of increased contributions to the EU budget due to the tax-free earnings many of these companies have from intangible assets. The State is making payments of approximately €200 million per annum to the EU budget as a result of this gross income which makes no contribution to Ireland's national budget. Over a ten-year period, this led to payments to the EU of approximately €2 billion as a result of those intangible onshore assets. However, tax will not be applied in this instance because the provision only applies post-11 October. That is wrong. The Government needs to amend its proposal to include all intangible assets in order to safeguard our tax base and ensure that the State is not unnecessarily picking up the tab for increased EU budget contributions relating to tax-free multinational corporation activities. That is not a loophole. It is a deliberate policy choice on the part of the Government. The same was true when the double Irish was phased out but companies using it can carry on doing so until 2020. Let us do the job right first time around. Of course, what we are doing is reversing a past Fine Gael decision brought in because the double Irish was being closed down. There was dismay among the farming community and farm organisations on foot of the Government's proposal to triple to 6% the rate of stamp duty on farmland, despite the assurances of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that the increased rate would not apply to farmland after the budget. We need to question how the Minister came to that conclusion. Was he given an assurance by the Minister for Finance or did he just not understand it? Sinn Féin supported an amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzmaurice in an attempt to amend the Government's proposal but Fianna Fáil abstained when the matter was put to a vote. As a result, this measure came into effect on budget night.

There was a vote on budget night. Deputy Michael McGrath was on RTE that night. There was a vote on budget night to pass the Government's resolution which nullified the amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzmaurice. This hung farmers out to dry and Fianna Fáil Deputies sat on their hands as that went through and decided not to vote with Deputy Fitzmaurice. The Government is now trying to cover up its mistake by eliminating the cap that limits certain reliefs to those under the age of 67. However, the Government's incompetence continues because this would negate the original purpose of the Government's measure, which was to incentivise the early lifetime transfer of land to the next generation and to encourage young farmers to extend their holdings. The Finance Bill needs to be amended in order to ensure that working farmland is not subject to stamp duty at 6% in situations where the reliefs in place do not apply. We all know that taxation can do two things, namely, it can lead to behavioural change and introduce additional revenue. Sometimes we do it for both reasons and at others we do it for one or other of the reasons. However, we need to incentivise and encourage farmers to be economically viable. In some cases, that requires them increasing their land holdings. The implementation of the transition period in this Bill raises more questions. There is confusion among farmers involved in sales. They are told they will not be charged 6% but that was the law passed before midnight on budget day. I mentioned a particular case to the Minister and, in fairness, he has asked me to provide the details to him. The problem is that the law of the land states that 6% is applicable and that the individual has four weeks to make the transaction. The Finance Bill will rectify that but it will be weeks before it is passed. Individuals who went to the bank and took out hundreds of thousands of euro to purchase and to pay the stamp duty simply do not have the money to pay an additional 4%. We need to rectify that as quickly as possible. As the banking inquiry highlighted, commercial real estate was one of the major causes of the banking crash. For that reason, it needs to be monitored and taxed appropriately and that is why we support the principle of an increase in commercial stamp duty. Indeed, it is something for which we called not just in this budget but last year as well. I am concerned, though, that simply multiplying by three the expected revenue will not result in the full potential being reached. We will measure that as we go along. Another measure in need of amendment is the bringing forward of the seven-year CGT exemption, which is a stroke that will mainly benefit auctioneers and speculators. The Government is moving forward the cash-in date for land and property to be sold CGT-free without any guarantee of any effect on housing supply. The measure needs to be limited to land. Why would we allow them to cash in on commercial properties that were bought during this period and that will be sold next year in any event? Why would we allow them to avoid paying over 30% CGT? This should apply only to land, not property, and it should only be land that is suitable for residential development. By allowing landowners to cash in on this land and property years early, the Finance Bill is creating a bonanza for certain speculators. We discussed how it is the €5 budget but certain individuals who were planning to sell major commercial buildings next year did not get €5, they got millions of euro as a result of not having to pay any CGT. Furthermore, this proposal is not relevant to the vulture funds that have bought up huge amounts of prime development land in the State. That is because the seven-year CGT exemption does not apply to such funds. The international funds that have been buying up land were never liable for CGT. This was used as the new pin-up for the construction industry by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, as a way of trying to get this bonanza for speculators and developers. The reality is that vulture funds do not pay CGT so they will be completely unaffected by this move because of the way they structure the companies that purchase these assets. The Finance Bill is missing the wood for the trees. The real flaw is the five-year exemption for funds that was introduced last year. Even Department of Finance officials have said that this measure is clogging up the market, yet there was no reference to this rule on budget day when the announcements were being made. I note, however, that the Minister has flagged an amendment to the Finance Bill. We need to see whether that amendment will go to the heart of this issue. I fear that some misguided commentary by Fianna Fáil has focused too much attention on the seven-year rule. The reality is that it is the five-year CGT rule that is really clogging up the markets. If we look at the basis for Fianna Fáil arguing for ending the seven-year CGT rule in respect of all properties, not just land, we can see that it talked about the NAMA internal memo but that memo shows that only 20% of the land the agency sold was in the timeframe eligible for the exemption. The other 80% fell outside the relief. In particular, the relief was not available when sales really ramped up from 2015 onward, as revealed in a NAMA internal memo. NAMA's sale of land really took off from 2015, with the potential delivery capacity from the land that NAMA sold of 37,892 residential units or 75% of the total residential delivery capacity from land sales by NAMA. They were not sold within that window of opportunity in respect of the CGT exemption so why are they still hoarding them? As a result of last year's Finance Bill, there is now an incentive for these funds to hold on and not sell until 2020, 2021 or 2022 because they are counting down the clock on the five-year dividend withholding tax exemption so that they can get out of Dodge, tax free. The Government needs to immediately end this tax break for vulture funds and amend the seven-year CGT rule so that it only applies to land, not property, and land that is designated for residential development. I am disappointed that there are no proposed changes to the research and development tax credit. The research and development tax credit is currently out of control. It increased drastically from €224 million in 2010 to €708 million in 2015, while the number of claimants is decreasing. On budget day last year, the Government published recommendations, none of which has been implemented. The research and development tax credit serves a useful purpose. Its aim is to stimulate the use of research and development activity across the State, which is welcome. However, the credit is currently out of control. It has increased sharply over the space of five years while the number of companies in receipt of the credit is decreasing. Ten companies are currently claiming two thirds worth of this credit - €460 million. In terms of helping smaller companies develop and grow, it is clearly failing. This raises significant questions about the accessibility and suitability of such opportunities for our smaller companies that could utilise such funding to develop and grow. It was revealed to me on foot of a freedom of information request earlier this month that concerns have been raised within the Department of Finance that companies are inflating the amount of research and development they are engaging in when claiming the credit. It is clear that urgent action needs to be taken to protect the Exchequer from this out-of-control tax credit. This is basically what the report the Government published last year called for. The Finance Bill must be amended to restructure the credit to ensure that it is targeted at areas of most need with special priority given to smaller companies undertaking actual research and development. Companies found to be exploiting the credit must be rooted out and limits for claim amounts, as suggested from Department of Finance correspondence, need to be introduced.This would reduce the overall cost of the credit while ensuring smaller companies get a fair share.  One measure I welcome is the exemption from the benefit-in-kind, BIK, charge for electric cars and vans that are provided to employees and the exemption from BIK on electricity used in the workplace for charging vehicles. However, the measure does not go far enough to promote electric vehicles as it is only directed at employees who get a car through work. In our alternative budget we proposed to raise the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant for electric vehicles by €1,000 per band to encourage greater uptake in people using electric vehicles.  I welcome the proposed changes to the domicile levy, which may have an impact on the appeals to the domicile levy. I also welcome the clarification that worldwide income for the purposes of the levy is income before deducting capital allowances and losses. However, I am still surprised the levy only raised €2.3 million in 2015. I hope we can work together in the finance committee to ensure it brings in more revenue to the State. The Finance Bill does not include measures to introduce a VAT refund scheme for charities, which was announced on budget day. It strikes me as unusual and I seek clarification from the Minister as it is my understanding that charities should begin to prepare a claim in 2018 for payment in 2019. It seems logical that the rules and details would be laid out in the Finance Bill. I seek reassurances that the lack of detail does not imply a lack of action. On the sugar-sweetened drinks tax, sections 30 to 42, inclusive, of the Bill contain the required legislative provisions and are subject to a commencement order. I strongly support this measure and look forward to teasing out the details. I hope some day in future we will be able to delete this from the finance legislation because it will have done its job.  The decision not to make any changes to the help-to-buy scheme amounts to another €40 million going straight into the pockets of developers. It is a baffling decision. It is a bad idea that will cost tens of millions. I am weary of the Government trying to justify demand-side solutions to a supply-side problem because the €40 million being spent on the help-to-buy scheme could build 836 houses. Which is better value?  I have touched on what is missing from the budget in the likes of the help-to-buy scheme and the changes to the research and development tax credit system but there are many other noticeable absences. What about our friends in the banking sector? There are no increases in their levy. They have tax-free status for another two decades. How does the Government stand over AIB and Permanent TSB not paying a penny of corporation tax for two decades? We are told the Government is now considering all of this. Why is that? It is because the media have forced it to. They have raised the issue to such a level that there is now a judgment in political circles that it would be damaging electorally for the Government not to start making some noises about the issue. I look forward to teasing out, as we do every year with the Finance Bill, why the Government is allowing some of the most profitable banks in Europe to go without paying any corporation tax. I note the introduction of the KEEP scheme and will tease out the details at committee level. I am disappointed there has been intense lobbying which has scared the Government from increasing VAT on hotels and betting for another year. The right thing to do would have been to increase VAT on the hotel sector and retain it for the other parts of the tourism sector. I am sure we will be back at this next year.  We reject the Bill because we are in favour of having a functioning health system and we believe people have the right to a home. The Sinn Féin alternative would have delivered relief for those who needed it most but would have unashamedly championed public services over tax cuts. It would not open up huge gaps and breaks in the tax system to benefit those who need them least. This is a bad Finance Bill not just for its tax cutting agenda at a time of crisis but also because it leaves out the big changes needed to make our tax system fairer.  Earlier today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, on behalf of the Taoiseach, told us the State chose not to provide the €1 million necessary to fund necessary research into sexual violence. That €1 million is not available yet the Finance Bill cuts €335 million of taxes. We know where the Minister's priorities and those of Fianna Fáil lie.

People will be relieved that taxes are not rising. At the same time, the tax increases that have been brought in, while welcome by individuals, make very little difference in the greater scheme of things. I do not know if the Minister has read the ESRI analysis which contains a verdict that by the end of 2018 the effect of the budget will be to lead to small losses in income at all levels because it fails to index bands and allowances and gives quite small levels of taxation. I will take the Fianna Fáil argument for its budgets of 2009 and 2010, which it claimed were progressive, as an example. They were progressive in the mechanical and mathematical sense that when one makes 330,000 people unemployed, they lose their earned income and most, if not all of them, go on social welfare. They then move down to a social welfare income. Therefore, in Fianna Fáil's mathematical model, 330,000 people losing their job results in a progressive budget. Try telling that to the poor Greeks and those in other countries. The ESRI analysis of the budget is very important. I am glad about the social welfare increases for 2018, which follow on from the increases in 2016 and 2017. In terms of tax justice as a concept, what we want is a balance in taxation that results in a tax system that is effective, fair and sufficient to achieve the tax levels necessary for the kind of investment and service levels that we want to see, particularly in health, housing, education and social protection. In social protection, we need pay related social insurance sufficient to continue to fund adequate pensions in retirement. The recent Social Insurance Fund report that was only published last week - I am not quite sure what the delay in publishing it was - and which was carried out by KPMG, tells the story that we cannot continue to fund the Social Insurance Fund in a way that will meet people's pension and retirement expectations unless we ensure it is sufficiently funded. The Minister will know as a former Government colleague that, as Minister for Social Protection, I fought very strongly to successfully resist the demands the troika imposed on Ireland in terms of the social welfare cuts it wanted at the outset. When I met the troika and others, including some people from the Minister's Department, everybody wanted cuts in the weekly rate of pension payments to pensioners. I am happy to say I resisted it and my colleagues in that Government supported me. There were no cuts to the core weekly payment whereas under Fianna Fáil, the core weekly payment was cut in two tranches by €16.40 a week for all payments, including unemployment, disability, carers and blind pension payments. They are cuts that even at this point in time, notwithstanding Fianna Fáil support through the confidence and supply arrangements, are yet to be fully restored. The critical problem that the previous Government and I faced was that by the time Fianna Fáil left office, there was a hole in the Social Insurance Fund that amounted to €2.8 billion. By the time that Government left office, it was back in surplus to the tune of about €200 million. The Minister might confirm that this year, the surplus will be somewhere in the region of €1 billion. Next year it could possibly double if employment and growth levels continue as we expect. Every year that I was Minister for Social Protection, I had to find an extra €200 million to fund the new pensioners coming into the system. The actuarial report on the Social Insurance Fund shows that figure rising to €220 million per year. It is a big burden and a large amount for any Minister for Finance to find. It is so important to social cohesion in Ireland that, collectively, all the parties in this House should contribute to maintaining a very solid pension system whereby the people working in this generation fund the retirement pensions of the people in retirement and, in turn, the later generations working will fund the pensions of the people currently paying into the system when they retire. It is only possible to do that if the funding is maintained at an adequate level. We will get an opportunity to discuss this on Committee Stage. The Bill makes a number of proposals on taxpayer information and the information that can be obtained from employers in respect of their payment of PAYE, PRSI and so on. I would be very confident that this will be subject to the appropriate data protection requirements which may arise. It is also to allow us to work towards what is sometimes called a real-time system of information and data. I want to make one plea to the Minister. He should not go down the road of the UK system of universal credits. When I was Minister, I looked not only at the UK system, which in a lot of its manifestations is pretty cruel on people on social welfare, but also at the systems in Sweden, Norway and Austria. Universal credit has all but broken the British social welfare model, which dates back to the 1930s and 1940s, because, particularly for people on very low incomes, universal credit simply cannot be dealt with in a sufficiently timely way in order to prevent depriving people on very low incomes of stoppages in their payments for six weeks, eight weeks or even longer at a time. The UK Minister responsible for this has been doing it on a trial basis. The outcome of the trial has been extremely disappointing. If people in the Department of Finance are considering offering the British model in Ireland, I would seriously caution that we should not do it. I accept that it would be very desirable to move to an IT system with real-time information. We have a very strong legislative underpinning of social welfare entitlements. For people who qualify, either by contribution or based on a means assessment, we can then deal with them directly. The UK is trying to combine the tax and social insurance systems and this is resulting in the people at the bottom of the ladder losing out in a very worrying way. In the North of Ireland, social welfare payments are significantly lower than in the Republic. If people in the UK have additional accommodation, charges are levied through the bedroom tax. The impact of this can be extremely cruel. I would like an assurance from the Minister that all the parties in the Dáil would work to maintain the Irish system and the funding relating to it, and not go down the road the UK has chosen. Most UK politicians of any party will say that they wish they never did this because they have damaged their system in such a way that if it is repairable, such repair will take decades. I welcome the move to get more information to taxpayers on a real-time basis and the other improvements in the system and records which hopefully will also make it easier for employers to deal with. I raised the banks' tax losses with the Minister last year, as I have done on many occasions. The reason the tax losses of the banks are now relevant is that the banks are now making profits. When companies are making losses, nobody is interested in tax losses because they have no taxable income. Now that we have banks with significant taxable income, I recommend to the Minister a system I suggested to the late Brian Lenihan when he was Minister for Finance and which he accepted, namely, to provide for a minimum effective corporation tax rate or to restrict the use of the losses. Losses have a legitimate function where companies lose for a couple of years but then get back into profitability. However, the level of losses built up by the banks in Ireland is extraordinary. The Revenue Commissioners gave me details of this, which I published almost two years ago. We again need to get agreement that it is wrong that a bank could make €700 million in profit but end up - here and now, when the country needs resources - making no contribution in corporation tax. I think that is folly. It is a slightly academic argument when banks are losing money and, therefore, have no taxable profits in any event. However, once they come into profit, these losses potentially mean that they can wipe out their tax bills for many years. That is unfair on ordinary taxpayers, including ordinary business taxpayers who never got the kind of bailout afforded to the banks. Irish taxpayers, including public servants, paid dearly in contributing to that bailout. The banks may have factored this in as a form of off-balance-sheet asset. We will get an opportunity to discuss this more on Committee Stage and there are several ways of doing it. We should introduce a minimum effective tax rate or limit the amount of losses banks can use in any one year. On the banks and the tracker scandal, when the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Lane, appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, to some extent he put his hands up and said, "What can I do?" There is a divided responsibility there. On the one hand, there is the need to try to have functioning banks for a vibrant economy. On the other hand, the banks have not bothered to deny that they have treated people in a very harsh and despicable way at a time when individuals have been incredibly vulnerable and terrified, particularly of losing their family homes. Pretty well all the banks have behaved in the same way. I acknowledge that AIB was probably the first to provide a specific unit and, therefore, that it has addressed far more cases than any of the other institutions. Perhaps that is because it is publicly-owned. The European Central Bank may need to examine this matter.It does not have a direct responsibility but confidence in the banking system is a function of fairness and equity in the system. It is not to be subject to a cartel of seven, eight, ten, 11 or 12 banks acting together in an extremely onerous manner towards ordinary customers of the banks. We also know that the interest rates charged by the Irish banks are very high. The Minister might be able to explain why they should be as high. By and large, they are one to three points higher than their European equivalents. For hard-pressed families and businesses, that is an enormous extra premium and charge they have to pay in this country. The Irish authorities may be able to deal with some of this but we now have European supervision of banks and it may require the European supervisory authorities to come in and examine what has happened. Within the Irish banking system traditionally, consumer protection and information have been bottom of the list in terms of the objectives of the banking system. Given the scandal that has happened and the suffering experienced by many people with some having lost their homes and businesses - the Minister suggested in his conversations with the banks' executives that they should have made the principal repayments of the excess payments people made by Christmas - I believe there will also have to be some redress for what people have suffered. The banks are experts at long-fingering everything. The Minister must set them a timeline and a specific objective for what they have to do. The banks were happy to have their hand out when they crashed and to take every cent that the taxpayer had to offer, but they are like the person who lends one an umbrella on a sunny day but the umbrella vanishes when the rain comes down. That is the way they act. There was a term always in use in America regarding the banks, that the people in banking on Wall Street used to characterise themselves as the masters of the universe. We have a set of bankers in Ireland who see themselves as masters of this particular universe-island. It is not good enough. I encourage the Minister, in every way, to sort them out. If the Department, the Central Bank or Minister do not seek to influence them now that the economy is in recovery - much of this was different when things were very bleak and black and the banks were trying to get out of the hole they had put themselves into - and if we do not get a handle on this, it is not impossible that it could come to pass that they would drive us all into the ground again. They have to understand that they cannot treat people, citizens of this country and their customers with the kind of disdain that they do. I also believe it will help us to sort the issue of restrictive credit that is choking off and stopping an adequate supply of new housing coming forward. We also have to address the interest rates in that regard. Notwithstanding the developments with the house building agency, we also have to find better mechanisms to encourage more local authorities to build social housing at a rate much faster than that to which they have currently committed. We need to consider as a matter of urgency the question of how we tax land. I have no difficulty in the reduction in the seven-year period to encourage more land supply. In the context of where we are at, that is certainly worthwhile. We will have to examine the issue of the taxation of land. In my constituency one does not get much in the line of a three or four-bedroom house below €400,000 - that is the price for a three-bedroom house on a fairly restricted site.

It is our job to make sure they cannot profiteer on the backs of people who need housing and that instead we have a fair playing field for them and also for the young couple, perhaps both working in the Minister's Department, who have built up a deposit for a house and want to buy a family home in which to reside. They should be the Minister's first priority and all the other individuals and couples like that who want to buy a house.

Fianna Fáil has largely supported the Minister, although it wants its cake and to be able to eat it, by taking credit for what its sees as the good measures in the budget but distancing itself from its failures. I put it to the Minister that this is a budget that simply does not address the big problems our society faces and is not what the people who needed help in the budget would have hoped for. We can talk all we like about prudence and balancing the books but what people hoped for after seven or eight years of crushing austerity - which robbed them of their incomes and, in some cases, their homes and their jobs, which saw the destruction of public services and cuts that have landed us in a diabolical housing crisis and that have landed the public health system in just about as bad as shambles as it could possibly be in - was that the budget might have substantially addressed some of those issues. They might have hoped for that in particular because the Government never stops crowing about what a success the Irish economy has become, about the recovery and about the fact that we are fastest-growing economy in Europe. Against that background, people might have expected more, but the fact of the matter is that the budget is not going to solve the problems. When we boil it all down, despite all the talk about balancing books, the reality is that 3,800 new council houses will be built next year against a background of 100,000 families who have now been waiting up to 17 or 18 years on a housing list and against a homelessness crisis that continues every week to spiral further and further out of control. There is no increase in the output of social housing next year over and above what had been promised previously; in the case of the health service, the nurses and doctors have told us - it is not the radical left saying this - that the additional allocation will just about, if at all, keep pace with the additional demands that will come on the health service next year; and for everybody else the increase is a fiver a week. That is against a background of the bills people have had to pay increasing dramatically. Rents have gone up 60% in recent years. Motor insurance premiums have gone up 60%. Bin charges are set to go up by another €30 a year next year. There are increases in the public service obligation levy, electricity and gas prices and so on.

I welcome the opportunity to move this Private Members' motion, which calls for the declaration of a housing emergency in order to: tackle the housing and homelessness crisis; stop banks, vulture funds and buy-to-let landlords from evicting families; stop repossessions; freeze, control and reduce rents; and entitle sitting tenants to continue their tenancies in sale situations, among other measures. There is no doubt that this country is in the throes of a housing and homelessness emergency. The Peter McVerry Trust put it starkly when it said, "The crisis is behind us and we have moved into a full-blown emergency." That housing emergency is getting worse. There are now 3,048 children in emergency accommodation, up from 2,973 in July 2017. This is an increase of 29% since August 2016. The total homeless population is now well over 8,000 people. Over 90,000 families are on local authority housing waiting lists and in excess of another 20,000 families are on housing assistance payments, a scheme which is a disaster for families and a bonanza for landlords. Thousands more are homeless, couch-surfing or doubling or trebling up with relatives. Sadly, we have seen deaths on our streets. This housing emergency cannot be fully ended until huge numbers of social and affordable houses are built by local authorities. That will take time but tens of thousands of people are enduring a nightmare now. Thousands of children are being damaged now, as we speak here this evening. Irish society is treating these citizens cruelly. The short-term measures being used by the Government are, at best, grossly inadequate. The situation is getting worse. While it continues, this is not a civilised society. That is why much more far-reaching measures are necessary merely to stabilise the situation, that is, to stop the housing and homelessness emergency from getting even worse. Stronger emergency measures are needed to eradicate homelessness and end the housing emergency.  This motion seeks to avail of the existing provisions of Bunreacht na hÉireann to declare a housing emergency and to delimit private property rights on a temporary basis until the housing emergency is ended. Article 43.2.1° of Bunreacht na hÉireann makes the exercise of private property rights subject "to be regulated by the principles of social justice". Article 43.2.2° goes even further, making the exercise of these rights subject to the exigencies of the common good. This motion does not attempt in any way to insert any new provision into or amend any existing provision of Bunreacht na Éireann. There is already an existing and current precedent in Irish law which can be utilised in accordance with these articles of Bunreacht na hÉireann in addressing the housing emergency. The precedent exists in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009, 2013 and 2015. Those Acts are currently on the books and in operation. The private property rights of pensioners were delimited under this legislation. The current leader of the Labour Party and former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, confirmed that to me during the course of that legislation. Speaking to the Select Sub-committee on Public Expenditure and Reform on 10 November 2015 he said, and his words are worth quoting:The bottom line is I agree with the thrust of what Deputy Healy said about pensions being a preserved property right. That has been determined by the courts. That is why we have taken very careful advices from the Attorney General, of which some have already been tested in the courts. The criteria required, as I have put on the record before, are that to sustain pension [reductions in a] contribution to [the emergency], [and the next line is very important] there needs to be an emergency which needs to be certified. The contribution must be one towards addressing that emergency. It needs to be proportionate in terms of the person's income and it needs to be non-discriminatory. In other words, one cannot say that a category of people should be deprived of a pension and that another category should not. It has to have general application.I believe the criteria set out by Deputy Howlin are met by the motion I am proposing. It is quite clear that during the current emergency in housing and homelessness, the State is entitled to delimit by law the exercise of private property rights in accordance with "the principles of social justice" and "the exigencies of the common good". Furthermore, it is also quite clear that the country is in the throes of a housing and homelessness emergency. As far back as May 2016, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, confirmed his belief that a housing emergency existed. He said, "I think we have a national emergency that needs a response that is comprehensive." Of course, the position has gotten much worse since then. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the largest civil society organisation in the country, also believes there is a housing emergency and has called for the declaration of such in its ten-point housing programme entitled "How We Can Solve the Housing Crisis". Point 1 of that programme states that, "to facilitate a rapid, coherent response, Government should declare a national housing and homelessness emergency and move to put in place a properly resourced, local authority-led emergency social housing programme." That call was also supported by Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and by Karan O'Loughlin, campaigning officer of SIPTU. The Peter McVerry Trust also acknowledged such an emergency and called for emergency measures, stating that the emergency powers needed to deliver actions that will immediately reduce the numbers of homeless individuals, couples and families must now be introduced. It is clear that a housing emergency exists in this State. All the advocacy groups and all those involved in supporting the homeless and housing organisations believe so. They believe it has become much more difficult and that the situation has got worse over the last years. It is also clear that emergency measures are needed to address the situation and that it is possible to legally declare a housing emergency in accordance with the precedent in law which I outlined earlier. It is further clear that private property rights can be delimited in accordance with Articles 43.2.1° and 43.2.2° of Bunreacht na hÉireann. I ask for the support of all Deputies in the House in respect of this motion, especially backbenchers of all parties, who know the situation at first hand.These Deputies are dealing with this situation at the coalface in their clinics on a daily and weekly basis and they know that the situation is getting worse and that what I am proposing is the only legal, commonsense and effective way forward in terms of solving the homeless and housing emergency that exists in this State.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	325	It is fair to say that this country, and the Government, are capable of dealing with a crisis, as demonstrated during the recent storm. Through political will, and using various arms of the State, it was well managed. I refuse to believe that another crisis cannot be dealt with, and dealt with adequately. Hardly a week goes by that the issue of the housing and homelessness crisis is not discussed in this House. It is the response to that crisis that is at issue. A test of any fair society is its capacity to house its people. We are here again this evening discussing this issue because despite all of the fancy words and so-called action plans, the main action is further entrenchment into the mindset of abdicating responsibility for housing to the private sector. In its current form, our housing sector has lost the concept of a home. It is fundamentally destabilising to society when we hear Government solutions to the crisis that are reliant on the private sector, such as the development of hubs. The Minister has sought to convince us that hubs are somehow desirable. We need to talk about homes, not hubs. If people cannot secure a home and put down roots, communities become transient and unstable. Society in general suffers. What sense of security do children growing up in emergency accommodation or hubs have? How can we blame them if they grow into dysfunctional youths? We are storing up very serious problems for the future. The State has all but abdicated its duty to provide social housing in the numbers required, opting instead for its preferred outsourcing model and increasing reliance on the free market. We need a return to what it means to provide a home, not just property. Housing costs are soaring. Many working people have no choice but to seek higher wages to buy or rent a home. Disastrous policy decisions on housing have devastating knock-on effects in society for years and, perhaps, generations. Across our cities and towns tonight there are increasing numbers of people on the streets. It is embarrassing to walk down any of the main streets in this city and take stock of what one sees. Families are sleeping on the couches of friends and relatives, very often unsure of where they will be in a week or a month's time.  People are paying high proportions of their income on rent or mortgages and they are absolutely terrified of losing their homes. To purchase a modest home in Cork or Galway a person needs to be earning approximately six times the average wage. To buy a home in Dublin, one needs approximately nine times the average wage. As we know, average rents have spiralled over the past four years. It is clear that there is no security for people renting and that buying a home is increasingly becoming a pipe-dream for many, which is not acceptable. The concept of a home is a basic human right but it has been wilfully replaced by the property ladder or is seen as an investment opportunity. This problem dates back a couple of decades.  The current housing and homelessness crisis not only scars the social fabric of our country, it undermines our competitiveness and labour mobility. The Government has many shiny plans but progress is painfully slow. It is a case of implementation deficit. The delivery aspect of these plans, along with political will in terms of the public aspect of housing, is at issue. The Government must take immediate action to ensure long-term rent certainty. We have previously called for the use of the consumer price index in this regard but it is now too high to make that argument. We need to drive down the cost of housing and to bring homes within the reach of people on ordinary incomes. We need a strong building sector, for which we must reduce costs, including finance costs. This also requires doing things to scale such that building is more efficient and less expensive.  The Government must challenge the EU fiscal rules which limit its capacity to invest in housing and other capital projects. The rules are hamstringing and exacerbating the crisis. This must be viewed from the perspective of spending to save. Reducing the price of housing and building to scale makes it easier to service debts into the future. We also need special measures to help young couples who bought apartments during the boom and now find themselves stuck with children in unsuitable accommodation. I know of people who are living with children in a two-bedroom apartment on the second or third floor of an apartment block. People, including many young couples, who bought small apartments during the boom are still in negative equity. Some of them have become accidental landlords because they have moved out and are renting out their apartments and now find themselves having to deal with Revenue. Others, as I said, are living with children in unsuitably small one or two-bedroom apartments, which they did not buy with that intention in mind. These home owners have been forgotten by Government. There was nothing in budget 2018 to assist them. Many are finding it difficult to service their existing mortgages or to keep up rent payments while at the same time trying to save the 20% deposit. They find themselves stuck, unable to buy family homes because they cannot compete in the over-heated housing market or against cash buyers. As an immediate response, we are calling for the Central Bank to carry out an impact assessment of the 20% deposit rule to see if it can be relaxed to enable this cohort of people to buy suitable family homes. This would free up the smaller type of accommodation that I understand is not the most attractive to build and it would allow people to move on when they need to do so. This cohort of people has not been considered. Any affordable housing model must factor in this group of people. This is a real problem, perhaps not for millions of people, but for a sizeable number of people.  The current constitutional framework is a profound obstacle to dealing with many of the problems in housing. Article 43 seeks to balance private property rights with the common good. Too often, the interpretation of that article means that the common good loses out. We either challenge this or we change it because it is not fulfilling what is provided for in the Constitution. The common good is supposed to be a central aspect of the right to private property. I have no problem with people having a desire and being enabled to buy property or a home but this provision is being used in a very negative way. This is not only happening regarding housing. When the rent caps were being introduced there was a degree of questioning as to whether or not it was constitutional. The same happened in regard to upward-only rent reviews. There are things that need to be challenged in this regard. We are in the midst of a devastating housing crisis. If the Constitution is an impediment, we need to either challenge it or change it.  Deputy Healy is right that there is not a Deputy in this House that does not have a degree of understanding of this crisis. Since I opened my constituency office this issue has been the number one issue raised with me by people. We all have a good understanding of the problem. It is the solution and the political will to deliver that solution that has been largely absent.There has been an ideological problem in respect of the kinds of problems we are seeing coming forward. If the Government were to challenge the fiscal rules in this regard, it would likely be successful. It is certainly an impediment to the country developing. Increasingly, Members are hearing that those in the building and industrial sectors consider housing an impediment to recruiting staff and growing the workforce. There are many reasons this problem needs to be tacked but the mindset needs to change first. We must see housing as more than a person trying to get on the property ladder. The basic right to a home has to be at the heart of any housing policy.

I do not doubt his sincerity, frustration or compassion for the citizens who most need our help. The Government is opposing the motion and has put forward an amendment to explain why that is so. In opposing the motion, the Government does not disagree that we are dealing with a serious crisis or an emergency, if one wants to call it that. However, it should be recognised that we have been dealing with the challenge for some time and progress is being made. That is why almost 18 months ago the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was reconstituted as the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and a senior Minister was given responsibility for housing. That was not a simple rebrand. Most of the former Department's functions in regard to the environment were reallocated to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. As Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government with additional responsibility for Irish Water and emergency planning such as in the case of Storm Ophelia, much of my work is dedicated solely to housing and homelessness. That is why much of the State's capital spend since 2016 and up to 2021 will go into housing and homelessness, involving a commitment of more than €6 billion over the period of Rebuilding Ireland, which is well under way and is working. Members will compare our current capital spend on housing with that which pertained in 2008. I remind those Members that was before an economic recession caused by an unsustainable level of public investment, over-reliance on property-related cyclical taxes and an economy over-concentrated on building development. It beggars belief that some Members still do not understand the massive failure by the then Government. I have said before that I am not opposed to declaring that there is a housing emergency but only if such declaration would be more than tokenistic and could lead to powers we do not already have that would fix our housing and homelessness problem. I began discussion of that issue with the Attorney General almost immediately upon taking office. The motion seeks to declare an emergency and in so doing suspend or delimit certain parts of the Constitution that deal with individual property rights. We cannot just suspend certain elements of the Constitution by decree or through legislation. If it was decided that could be done, it would set an incredibly dangerous precedent. While it might be done for just reasons today, someone could come along and do it for unjust reasons tomorrow. Our duty of care is not just to the current circumstances and generation but to those who will follow. Even if the Deputy feels that his motion would meet the Howlin test, if one wants to call it that, Members must ask if it is necessary. What would we do differently? How are individual property rights currently getting in the way of the public interest in terms of building more homes or tackling the homelessness crisis? They are not. A balance can be found between the individual good and the public good. We can do, and are doing, that within the parameters of the Constitution. The Government has several powers and has improved upon them in some instances. There is a role for compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, which are used in housing not just to acquire strategic land but also to tackle vacancy. Some local authorities have been more ambitious than others in that regard. That is why at the housing summit in September there was an exploration of CPO powers and local authorities were tasked with using their powers in a more streamlined, co-ordinated and practical way. The designation of rent pressure zones where limits are applied to rent increases in the private rental sector is another example of the public interest overriding the private. Bringing in definitions for "substantial refurbishment" under the rent zones extends those principles. Restrictions on the termination of tenancies in multi-unit developments where the property owner or landlord is seeking to sell, known as the Tyrrelstown amendment, again promote the public interest over the private interest. The introduction of a vacant site levy or the charge on vacant or under-utilised housing lands to incentivise their development also favours the public interest over the private, and the announcement in budget 2018 that the level will more than double to 7% per year from 2019 further strengthens that measure. Provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts to ensure a percentage, which is currently 10%, of residentially-zoned land is used for social housing also seek to provide for the public good over private or individual right to property. We can promote the public interest over individual property rights within the Constitution and are doing so. The chief executive of Dublin City Council recently said that he feared property interests are holding the city to ransom in terms of its potential for future development and blocking higher densities that would promote a better and more integrated increase in the capacity of the city for its residents. I agree with that. We will seek further changes to promote the more sustainable development of cities, and urban centres in particular. To seek further change to the Constitution or legislative amendment that I do not believe necessary and which may not be possible, acceptable to the public or even in the public interest would take our attention and resources away from getting the actual work done, and good work is being done. Four times more social housing homes will be built directly by the State this year than in 2015. There is no lack of political will on this issue. That responsibility was previously outsourced but the Government is taking it back. One does not get there by doing nothing or without a plan. One amendment to the motion states that fewer than 600 new social homes will be constructed in 2017 but that is simply wrong. When the Government established a Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, appointed a dedicated senior Minister to it and the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, put in place the Rebuilding Ireland plan we started to make progress in dealing with the housing shortage and developing solutions for the homeless. Rebuilding Ireland is working. Planning permissions and commencement notices are up almost 50% since the plan came into force. As I said, this year the Government will directly build four times more social housing homes through local authorities and housing bodies than it did in 2015. It will provide social housing supports to 80 new tenancies every working day of the week this year and that will increase to 98 next year. Rent inflation is on course to be half what it was in 2016 in areas where the pressure caps are in place. The number of homeless families in hotels fell for the first time in many months in Dublin in August and we are determined for that trend to continue. That did not happen by accident but as a result of Government policy that was criticised and opposed by others in the House. It happened in conjunction with local authorities, approved housing bodies, various stakeholders and experts in the industry, the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, the Residential Tenancies Board and the voluntary sector and many fine NGOs that are working with the Government and on behalf of citizens. A huge amount of work is being done. The resources of the State and our people are being brought to bear to face this challenge and to overcome it. That does not mean that we cannot and should not do more. We are doing more. The number of children in emergency accommodation demands that we do so. One does not set the wheels of any important work in motion and get out of the car as that is not how one ensures things get done. That is why I decided we need to constantly monitor and review the housing and homelessness crisis. We do not aim to make wholesale changes to the plan because people need certainty but, rather, to identify where changes could improve or expedite elements of it. Rebuilding Ireland does not need to be restarted but it needs to be steered in the right direction and certain things need to be speeded up. By 2021, which will mark the end of Rebuilding Ireland, 50,000 new homes will have been provided under it. In its closing years, more homes will be provided through direct build than the housing assistance payment, which will put us in a very strong position to continue in that direction in 2021 and to rebalance housing provision away from the private sector and toward a stronger responsibility for the Government to provide social housing for the citizens who need our help the most. As I keep Rebuilding Ireland under review and make improvements or changes to policy, I will announce them. That is what Members should concern themselves with rather than what they read in newspapers or what might be happening according to unnamed sources. They should pay attention to what the Government announces. If certain parties did so they would not have missed that I announced the social housing figures for 2018 at the housing summit in September rather than wait for the budget. I was quite happy that the main criticism of the housing budget from some on the left was that the Government announced its new targets for 2018 four weeks early. Some 30% more homes will be built directly by the State than was originally planned by Rebuilding Ireland but some Members tried to claim the targets did not change. The number of new builds next year will be almost double those this year but some Members have tried to claim that no new social housing homes will be built next year. Almost 8,000 new social housing homes will be added to the stock in 2018 when one includes long-term leases. Some say it should be 10,000 and I do not disagree. We will get there but, unfortunately, that will not be next year. Some Members say I should not make announcements but, rather, should just get on with the work. There is a problem with that. If the repair and lease scheme needs to be amended, I have to announce that and cannot keep it to myself. If there is to be an affordability scheme, as there is, I must announce that people will be able to access it. I will keep doing the work but when I make changes to policy I will announce them because that is important for transparency.It was important that we announced the new An Bord Pleanála fast-track process for large-scale developments when it was signed into force. It was important to announce that we were bringing forward new legislation to allow for a second extension of planning permissions where people were already building homes. We brought in this extension before the summer recess. It was important to announce the fire and life safety inspections of all social housing tenancies. This was extended to the private rental sector. It was important to announce the measures that came out of the housing summit, for example, the exit co-ordinators put in place, the additional money for hubs, the new inter-agency group to co-ordinate homelessness supports, the 30% increase in direct build for our targets for next year and the setting up of a national director of Housing First and more Housing First homes. It was also important to announce that we will have a change management programme for the Residential Tenancies Board to make it a strong regulator for the sector and that we will have new apartment guidelines for the build-to-rent sector. It was important to announce the new targets under Rebuilding Ireland out to 2021, the additional €75 million for affordable homes and affordable schemes, the increase in the vacant sites levy and the new finance vehicle for builders. All these announcements are not just empty statements. They are actions that people in this House called for. This is exactly the approach I said I would take - no more plans or roadmaps because we have them and they are guiding us successfully, but yes, new actions. I hope the House does not have a problem with me taking action and I hope Members do not think I should keep these actions to myself. I know it is very difficult now for many people, not just the rough sleepers or the families in emergency accommodation. People throughout the country are feeling squeezed because of the cost of their rent or the difficulty they have saving for a mortgage, and this at a time when most economic indicators tell us that it should not be so difficult. The human indicators tell a different story. We will continue to act in the public interest, as this motion calls on us to do, and as the Government amendment reaffirms.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	I am sharing time with my colleagues. I compliment Deputy Healy for having tabled the motion. Like all of us, he is obviously frustrated with the lack of progress we have seen in this area in recent years, despite the best intentions of many. I note in his motion the various references to the Constitution and to articles concerning the right to housing. The House agreed some weeks ago that the issue of enshrining a right to housing in the Constitution would be transferred to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for consideration among other rights-based initiatives. We ask the Government to move as quickly as possible in order that this would be properly analysed and scrutinised with a view to being in a position to have a commonality through the Constitution whereby one reference does not surpass another. There are potentially different descriptions associated with housing about which there needs to be a commonality. I note also that the Deputy refers in the motion to the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation enacted in 2009, 2013 and 2015 and the potential such emergency legislation has to give effect to emergency housing provision. That potential is there. However, this is not necessarily backed up in the motion with specific ways and means by which it might be addressed. To this end, I accept that it is something we must keep under review, perhaps with a view to going down that road at a future date in the event that the various actions that have been promised are not adhered to. In our amendment to the motion we note, as we have done on many occasions during various discussions in the House on this area and on various Bills that were introduced, that this crisis has not been dealt with in the manner in which many had hoped it would be dealt with. We have passed several motions, as I said, and various legislation pertaining to the housing crisis over recent years. The Government has had four housing Ministers, four policies and numerous launches of plans since 2014, yet the State has built fewer than 3,500 homes since 2011. That is less than the number constructed every year on average between the years 1994 and 2010. Fewer than 600 social homes have been constructed this year, while the Rebuilding Ireland target is 5,000. Only 24% of the 10,000 units in the construction pipeline are on site, so it will be 2021 before most are built, compared with the already unambitious target of 26,000 units. While the improvement in the capital allocation is welcome, the capital house building budget of €730 million in 2017 and €1.14 billion in 2018 is still 24% below 2008 levels. Due to years of undersupply and pent-up demand, we now need 40,000 to 50,000 new homes per year to make a dent in the demand and a noticeable impact on affordability. Clearly, housing is witnessing a market failure. New interventions, as we have said, are required to stimulate supply. We believe the Government's reluctance to accept the challenge and its refusal to make any such interventions in the housing market are making a crisis worse. The programme for Government commitment to initiate an affordable housing scheme and the failure of the Government to date to reintroduce affordable housing initiatives for low and middle-income households needs to be restated again in the context of this debate in order for the record to show that no progress has been made in this area to date at least. We go on in our amendment to call on the Government to acknowledge publicly the pressing need for delivery over spin in addressing the housing crisis. We call on the Government to commit to meeting Rebuilding Ireland's targets on moving homeless families out of hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation by the end of this year, to revise the emergency homelessness strategy and, in particular, to redesign the housing assistance payment, HAP, and homeless HAP schemes in order that households are not discouraged from taking up a tenancy and are not removed from the main social housing waiting list, which, unfortunately, is the case at present and worries many who are faced with that prospect and that dilemma. We also call on the Government to continue to increase and rebalance the housing budget towards capital expenditure on foot of the discrepancies I mentioned in respect of the increase that is there but which is still behind many of the targets that we would hope to meet. We call on the Government to devise a strategy to enable and encourage far greater scale and size in house building programmes, including social house building projects, and recognise, as I said, the significant market failures, including in planning, finance and infrastructure, and the cost of construction, which the market requires State intervention to overcome. We call on the Government to commit to the reintroduction of affordable housing schemes, including affordable owner-occupier and rental schemes for middle-income households. We call on it to explore the possible financial incentives aimed at encouraging development of housing at more affordable price points. We call on Government to introduce financial incentives to build high-density developments where they are currently not commercially viable to build - in Dublin city and many local authorities in other areas - because of this. Commitments have been talked about but they have not been followed up with action, and I hope to see progress in this regard. We call on the Government to commit to greater enforcement in implementation of the rent pressure zones and other rent regulations, including more staffing and resources for the Residential Tenancies Board. Again, there is provision within the budget announcement for further funding. Will the Government confirm that this will be in place in the short term and that we will see increased staffing and resources in order that the cases are dealt with more appropriately and more expediently? We call on the Government to tackle land hoarding by large investors, which is clearly holding back supply, make changes to capital gains tax and introduce a new site tax to encourage the use of empty sites. Again, we need legislation to give effect to what we are told is forthcoming. We call on the Government to devise new strategies to manage vacant properties, including an active occupancy register. We had the support of the House in respect of proposals and a Bill we brought forward in this area. We ask that this be brought to Committee Stage for proper legislative scrutiny to allow all parties and the Government to devise a mechanism by which that can be forthcoming and to address the short-term measures regarding the provision of units. We must not only revitalise and re-energise many towns and villages throughout the country in their efforts to address this, but also help to promote towns and villages and bring vibrancy back to them. I will defer to my colleagues.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	328	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy English, for being here to listen to the debate. I am sorry the Minister had to leave. Nevertheless, I am glad the Minister of State is here to respond to the debate. I think this is our third or fourth opportunity to address this matter and I am grateful to Deputy Healy for giving us another opportunity to put more points about this housing emergency to the Government. While supporting and seconding the Fianna Fáil amendment, I see where Deputy Healy is coming from and support the spirit in which he has tabled the motion.I had outlined previously that the process is flawed. Before the Minister of State or his colleagues went into the Department, they were strangled. It takes between three and six years from idea to turning the key on a local authority house whereas, in the private sector, it is 18 months to two years. The Government needs to tear up what is referred to as the streamlined process, given the duplication that goes on between planners, architects and engineers in a council, in the Department and in the building unit in Ballina, which is ridiculous in the extreme. There will be many more people homeless unless the Government does this and gets on with it. With regard to building, we cannot continue to deal with window dressing in the House while pontificating about what could, should or might be done. We need to get out and do it. That means the State undertaking a wholesale building programme similar to the 1950s, not depending on the private sector alone to do it or on some hare-brained, complex scheme to deliver it. We need to get out there and begin to do it ourselves, but not with the current process that takes between three and six years, as the evidence will show. The public sector cannot do it on its own. We need not just the big-name guys who managed to refinance throughout the world and who were the big names in NAMA in the past. We need the small guy who used to build five houses in Collooney, ten houses in Ballyshannon, 30 houses in Sligo town and so on throughout every county in the country. They cannot do that because the same banks we are trying to have punished today for the disgrace and scandal that is the tracker crisis are only lending in primary areas and they will not lend in what they describe as tertiary areas. While they will not tell us that on the record, in effect, that is happening everywhere outside Dublin, although to a small extent they will lend in places like Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Equally, many of the builders with the expertise of the past, those small, hard working guys who gave good employment - the five-unit, ten-unit and 20-unit builders - are subservient not to NAMA, which has washed its hands of them as if the problem no longer exists, but to some vulture fund. This means they cannot get up and running. They cannot get finance from the banks, as I said, because the banks will only lend in areas that are non-tertiary, which is a major problem. What is required, and it has been mooted by the Government, Fianna Fáil and various speakers in the House, is some sort of housing finance bank along the lines of ACC or ICC, which served a tremendous role in the past in getting industry and agricultural enterprise up and running through difficult times. It worked then and it is needed again now. The level of taxation on houses is an issue. None of us like to see taxes cut against builders who we like to think are all extremely wealthy. However, that is not the case for the small man, who we need to kick this thing on. Here in Dublin, for example, between one third and a half of the price of an average three-bed, semi-detached house is going to the State between VAT, levies and other types of taxation. We need to look at that. We need to be radical and consider pushing that VAT down to get the bloody thing moving again, to try to get houses built. It is not to feather builders' nests with profits, and while that is an issue that may have to be revisited once we get things moving again, for now, it must be done. I touched on the availability of finance. In addition, we need measures such as a potential stay on development plans throughout the country. When it comes to housing projects, it may be better to send those directly to An Bord Pleanála, although that should not be done with its current resources. If we are going to do that and have it streamline a process and get the turnaround time improved, An Bord Pleanála needs more staff. Applications could then be looked at very quickly and turned around. The reality is this housing crisis is having a chilling effect on foreign direct investment coming to Ireland, for example, in the cases of the European Investment Bank and the European Medicines Agency, which we were pitching for. Even if the 5,000 or 6,000 people decided they did want to come to Ireland, where would they live? We have a housing crisis, a homeless crisis and thousands of people in hotels. There is also the issue of boarded-up units. In the last debate I had the opportunity to put on record that 933 units in Dublin alone have been boarded up for more than ten years. How many have been boarded up for less than that? Relatively speaking, that is replicated in every county in the country. The theory of wanting a fully integrated society with a good mix of social housing along with private housing is honourable and we should aspire to it. However, for years we have been refusing to buy up units at cheaper prices in what were former local authority schemes throughout the country. That is madness. We are paying €300,000, €400,000, €500,000 and €600,000 for local authority housing in private units while overlooking places such as Sligo town, where five houses could be bought for €100,000 in a former local authority scheme. We are not being as radical as we need to be to match the radical reality of an emergency in housing. These are just some tangible suggestions. It would be very radical, for example, to push down VAT or put a stay on development plans in order to bring forward appropriate measures. However, these are the kinds of things we need to be prepared to look at, rather than coming in here every month, whenever Members are prepared to use their Private Members' time to deal with these issues. We must take tangible action.

There is no place like home. It is the ambition of many people across the country but more and more are struggling as the housing crisis is deepening. There needs to be action on housing - action for the benefit of people who want to build their own homes, action for people who are renting, action for people who want social housing, action for people want to buy or who have bought and are clinging on to their home, and, of course, action for the homeless. As we know, houses are not going to be built overnight and very few are being built at present. The Minister needs to quickly get existing vacant properties into use, such as the living-over-the-shop vacant units in rural areas, villages and towns centres, in order to reinvigorate our town centres. Of course, the recent budget tax relief is helpful and, hopefully, there will be more take-up than for the Government's last renovate and rent scheme, where only a handful of people were approved. The Government needs to support people who want to build their own homes in their own community. Commitments have already been made for infrastructure such as sewerage schemes in villages like Coachford, Ballingeary, Ballyvourney and many others across the country. Without these schemes, locals cannot build their own homes. The Government needs to service these schemes to release locals and let them get on with building their own homes and freeing up rental units. There are already existing finished houses in many villages, such as Coachford, that cannot be occupied until the sewerage is built to serve the area. Rent pressure zones need to be reviewed and enforced. When they were introduced, we pointed out that electoral areas were too big and too blunt a way of doing this. It means that at Classes Lakes in Ovens, an estate of over 400 homes, half of the homes are in the Ballincollig rent pressure zone while the other 200 homes are outside. Common sense needs to prevail. There should be flexibility and the entire estate should be within the rent pressure zone. The Government also needs to ensure that the rent pressure zones are being enforced. The standard of rental properties must also be addressed and Fianna Fáil is bringing forward a vacant housing Bill to address the matter. Very few social houses are being built at present, fewer than 800 of the target of 5,000 this year. There needs to be an increase both in the funding and in terms of rebalancing the housing budget, pushing more money towards capital and letting the councils get on with building more houses. The Government also needs to put in place a mechanism to allow voluntary housing agencies and credit unions build homes and get people off the housing list. As housing prices increase, the pressure from banks and vulture funds is being heaped onto people who are in arrears, pushing them towards homelessness. There are already too many people in that situation, with over 3,000 children homeless. Abandoning targets to house people in hotels and continuously failing to put a dent in rising homeless numbers cannot be continuously ignored.
#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	330	As my colleagues have previously pointed out, it is time to ensure that practical steps are taken to resolve this housing emergency. Bringing in legislation as an answer to a problem is futile when the issues pertaining to the problem have not been adequately teased out or, in many cases, not even addressed. Once a structured plan is in place, additional powers may then be discussed, where practical. With four Ministers in the past four years, there is little surprise that progress has not been made. One Minister seemingly looked for the position but - excuse the pun - he ran in the front door and ran out the back door as quickly as he could. This is not an emergency that crept in today or yesterday. We need to focus on getting results and forget about spin and rhetoric, both of which the Government is very good at. Clearly, the provision of 800 social houses falls well short of the action plan target which projects 5,000. The capital house building project is still 51% below 2008 levels.Granted, it is to be increased to €1.4 billion in 2018, but how can inroads be made when the budget remains well below what is required? A lady in her 80s presented at my constituency office just last week. She had nowhere to go and was homeless. At short notice the only facility available to her was a local nursing home. Obviously, this accommodation is temporary, but it is still not acceptable. It is not acceptable to take up a bed in a nursing home that is needed by many others, nor is it acceptable that an 80 year old woman should face this indignity. While the HAP scheme could work well, and to be fair, it has worked in many circumstances, changes need to be made to encourage landlords and tenants to avail of it. That said, even when applicants are accepted onto the HAP scheme, there is a huge shortage of rental properties across south-west Cork. The position is not helped by the fact that councils do not know in an organised manner which properties have been vacant long-term or why they are vacant. This issue needs to be addressed immediately. As an aside, the rental sector needs stricter regulation in the upkeep of properties, many of which are simply not maintained. It is not fair or reasonable to ask a tenant to reside in a substandard property. As is the case in many rural areas, young couples in south-west Cork aspire to build their own family home. Clearly, there are huge costs associated with this. The position is compounded, however, by exorbitant levies and fees imposed by local councils. This places the idea of owning one's own home out of reach for many people. Private house building needs to be accessible to anybody who wishes to settle down in his or her own local area. Some progress has been made in budget 2018, but a lot more work is needed if this matter is to be addressed in any reasonable manner.

Sinn Féin supports the principle behind the motion which we fully support. It is almost three years since Jonathan Corrie died on steps just opposite the entrance to this building. When he died as a rough sleeper, many of us were very reticent to comment publicly. This was in part out of respect for his family and friends. We did not want to be accused of being seen to use his very tragic death as a stick with which to beat the then Government. In the following weeks and months some of the commentary in the public debate increasingly appeared to attribute blame for his tragic and untimely death to aspects of his own life, that it had had to do with his mental health, lifestyle choices or refusal to enter into emergency accommodation. The more I learn about the detail of the case the more I am firmly of the view that none of these things is true. The death of a person like Jonathan Corrie is the direct result of a housing system which has been designed in such a way that it cannot find a permanent home for anybody, whatever complex issues Jonathan had in his life. The months passed and the promises and, in some cases, Government interventions rolled on. Others died and their names were never printed in the newspapers or they never became household names. In August and September there were three deaths of people who had been experiencing homelessness: Jennifer in Cork, Danielle in Kildare and a young man who was living in emergency accommodation in the city centre. The debate that followed these deaths was of a very similar nature. Even the then Taoiseach, speaking on his way into the Government's housing summit, seemed to suggest the linking of the homelessness of these individuals with their cause of death was bad journalism and a misreporting of the facts. I know some of the cases quite well, from speaking to local politicians and county managers, and there is a direct link in all three cases between the experience of homelessness and the untimely death of the person involved. In the past seven days there have been three more deaths, of rough sleepers in this instance, in three different parts of the State, namely, Tralee, Dublin and Dundalk. I say all of this and choose my words very carefully because at some point we will have to accept that there is a relationship between Government policy, the housing crisis, the growing levels of homelessness and the increasing numbers of people who are losing their lives. At this point that is an indisputable fact. I do not know what peoples' definition of an emergency is. People are dying on the streets because there is no emergency accommodation available and the emergency accommodation that is available is not appropriate. People cannot access permanent housing, or the allocation offer they have been made by a local authority is so stressful that it leads to someone taking his or her own life. That is the very definition of an emergency, but it is not the only definition. Before he left the Chamber the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said the Government was making progress, but the figures for homelessness suggest otherwise. Since Fine Gael took office six years ago, there has been a 300% increase in the level of child homelessness. That is not progress. Since the Government took office in 2016, there has been a 30% increase in almost all categories of homelessness. That clearly is not progress. On many occasions I have said the Government is simply not doing enough. There is not enough action to stem the flow of families moving to homelessness. The delivery of social housing is moving at a snail's pace and there is still a chronic over-reliance on the private sector by a factor of 70:30 for the delivery of housing that people need. At his housing summit the Minister announced 18 measures which he appeared to justify in the Chamber today. Half of them had already been announced, or amounted to the rebranding of existing initiatives. Other measures will actually make the situation worse such as requiring all landlords to register all notices to quit with the Residential Tenancies Board, with no extra powers being given to the board. The Minister has made big play of saying the additional new build units were a big win. It would be if they were in addition units to the total amount already announced for delivery, but they are not. It was a figure shifted from acquisitions, which would actually be a quicker and better process for those in long-term homelessness. I am happy that there will be more new builds, but the total quantity announced by the Minister is exactly the same as that announced by the former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, more than one year ago I am sorry that the Minister is not in the Chamber to hear me speak, but since July he has made 64 separate policy announcements as part of his review of Rebuilding Ireland. Some have some merit and some have none at all. Some are reannouncements or a repackaging of other measures. My criticism is not that the Minister is making policy announcements but that the announcements lack any coherence whatsoever. It seems as though somebody is flailing around desperately trying to give the impression that action is being taken and changes are being made when, in fact, the very opposite is the case. Perhaps it is because he has not appointed a senior policy adviser on housing, he has a junior and inexperienced press officer or he just does not understand the depth of the crisis, but it is clear that we are not hearing the kinds of announcements and new initiatives that are urgently required to tackle it. The Government's counter motion is indicative of this. It refers to one aspect that is directly related to Deputy Healy's motion, something Deputy Cowen also mentioned, which is the referral of the socio-economic rights recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. What better way to bury the recommendations than referring them to a committee that is wholly inadequate to deal with the matter. They should have been referred to a special Dáil committee with a range of expertise, or they should have been referred to the respective committees such as housing and health committees and so on. Referring them to the finance committee sends a very clear signal that money trumps rights and that we will not have a rights-based approach to this or any of the other issues in hand. With regard to Fianna Fáil's amendment, I mean this in all sincerity, I find it disappointing that Deputy Cowen tabled the amendment in that form. I agree with much of what is contained in it, but it is actually not an amendment to the motion but an alternative proposition altogether. It would have been better if we had all sent a clear signal to the Government that we were not satisfied with the lack of urgency shown in tackling the homelessness crisis. We could have dealt with Deputy Cowen's amendment and the other policy issues, some of which have merit, while some do not, on another occasion. Sinn Féin is more than happy to support Deputy Healy's motion. Irrespective of the outcome, crucially we need to see the Government taking more action, delivering more homes and getting more families off the streets and out of emergency accommodation in order that there will be no more deaths.

It is a sad fact that has been born out of the inaction of successive Governments. Fine Gael's reliance on the private sector to provide the required housing has proved to be disastrous.The Government has also been deaf to our calls for a national social and affordable housing programme. If the Government and its predecessors had listened sooner, we might have avoided some of the worst aspects of the housing crisis and reduced the disastrous impact it has had on our most vulnerable citizens. Recently, Sinn Féin published a vacant homes policy which calls on the Government to adopt a more ambitious approach to dealing with vacant properties. One of the key recommendations is the hiring of dedicated vacant homes officers within local authorities. These officers would be tasked with engaging with the owners of vacant properties to encourage them to return their homes to use. Vacant homes officers would build up a vacant homes register and work to a vacant homes plan. Such a plan is just one of the measures the Government could adopt to ensure that families have a place they can call home. Another constructive measure would be the introduction of rent certainty. Until this is achieved, the Government should, at the very least, extend the rent pressure zone legislation to the entire State. The Government continually fails its citizens. It has had ample opportunity to rectify these man-made crises. It had the opportunity in its most recent budget to allocate resources and proper funding to alleviate the housing and homelessness crisis, but chose not to. The launch of the budget fell, coincidentally, on World Homeless Day but it was notable for its lack of any real initiatives to resolve the housing for the homeless crisis. The budget will fail to reduce homeless numbers or decrease the enormous number of people on local authority housing lists. It will also fail to increase the number of units being built. Already, demand vastly outstrips the number of units being built. As our homeless die on our streets and as families and individuals struggle to find a place to call home, the Government offers no hope, only disappointment, to these unfortunate people. We see the consequences of the Government's failed housing policy every day when we walk the streets and lanes around Leinster House. We see the Government's failure in the rough sleepers in shop doorways and along the side streets of our towns and cities and in those families moved, often every day, from one bed and breakfast accommodation to another. We see its failed policies in the thousands of children growing up in an environment of instability and uncertainty. The Government has provided no hope for the future to these unfortunate people. We must build more social and affordable housing, and local authorities need to take a lead role in that regard.

The issue at the centre of his motion is very important in addressing the complex issue of housing. It is, at its heart, about balancing property rights and the common good under the Constitution and that is something we need to address carefully. I have tabled an amendment because the Labour Party does not believe it is necessary to declare an emergency in the way FEMPI legislation was introduced in order to address this issue. This time last year, we published a Bill seeking to implement the Kenny report as recommended by the all-party committee on the Constitution in its ninth progress report on private property. The report concluded that the Oireachtas has the power to restrict property rights in the public interest. A number of court decisions since then have established this in constitutional law. As such, there is no need for any kind of emergency legislation. We refer in our amendment to the decision in the matter of the Planning and Development Bill 1999, in which the Supreme Court held that the Oireachtas is entitled to conclude that the provision of affordable housing and housing for persons in special categories, and of integrated housing, is rationally connected "to an objective of sufficient importance to warrant interference with a constitutionally protected right and, given the serious social problems which they are designed to meet, they undoubtedly relate to concerns which, in a free and democratic society, should be regarded as pressing and substantial". Certainly, the homelessness crisis makes it clear that the common good trumps property rights in the current situation. There is no reason the Kenny report recommendation on the purchase of land at its current value plus 25% cannot be implemented. This is important because the hoarding of land is one of the factors which is curtailing supply. There is a great deal of property owned by developers which could be developed. They make the argument that it is not affordable to build, but I am sure they are already rushing to get involved in the 700 publicly owned sites on which public money is being spent to create infrastructure. They will rush to have their piece of the action on those sites. An example was made public in my constituency last week. In one way, it is very good news. A sizeable piece of land in Mungret is subject to a plan to build approximately 850 homes. Almost all of the land is owned by the local authority and a great deal of the infrastructure fund has been spent on it. Money from the Department of Education and Skills has also been spent there because there are three schools on the site also. My concern is that we have no guarantee that the homes which will be built on that site will be affordable. I have expressed that concern publicly. There is no affordable housing scheme to date. The local authority must now grapple with the development of this site in the absence of a national programme to ensure the homes are affordable. If one looks at any of the statistics around the cost of housing, which is not as expensive in Limerick as it is in Dublin, we are in danger with these sites, which Members will also have in their own constituencies, of ending up in that same situation. At the end of all of this, publicly owned sites will be built on while the privately owned sites are sat on until more profit can be made. We have to intervene in that situation or we will fail to get the necessary level of public housing we need. I support those who have said we need to see public housing happen quickly. I am interested in the various figures on house completions in different years. Deputy MacSharry made the point that the length of time it takes to get from the beginning to the end of a public housing programme is a real problem. There are many sites which are now ready but we need to see public and affordable housing predominate on them. My fear is that this will not happen. Either they will sit and wait for another couple of years, or the housing will be predominantly private housing for profit at prices above what ordinary families can afford. That is a crucial issue. We will end up in the same situation with everyone competing for the small number of social houses that become available and the small number of houses which are affordable to the average family. There are then the people who are squeezed into the private rental market who are on social housing lists but cannot get a house or who cannot afford to buy a house because they cannot get a mortgage or save the amount for the deposit. Those people are stuck in the same rental process with a limited amount of supply. As such, we need to get moving on both ends. We need to get the private market building without hoarding land and we need to get public and affordable housing and mixed tenure situations on publicly owned land. All of these things are interconnected and important. That is why I welcome Deputy Healy's motion. I do not have any huge problem with it albeit we felt it should be amended on the basis that we can actually act now. We have added some other matters such as linking rental increases to the consumer price index which many of us have already proposed in legislation in the House. We must deal with the issue of rent pressure zones.I do not know if the Minister of State will have an opportunity to reply but we were told there would be a review of the issue relating to rent pressure zones because they are not working. Areas are excluded, as Deputy Moynihan indicated. Excluding a city such as Limerick does not work and that puts people in extraordinarily difficult situations. The Ó Cualann voluntary housing co-operative in Ballymun is an example where, if public land and a not-for-profit system is used, affordable homes can be provided even in Dublin, which is the most expensive part of the country. This model is an indication of what can be done with publicly owned land by people who do not make a profit from building homes. Homes are for people. They are a social necessity and they should not be for private profit.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	334	I wish to share time with Deputy Boyd Barrett. We are debating the housing crisis. I have no faith in the market or the Government to solve this problem and, therefore, I would like to use my contribution to call on the trade union movement to organise a major national demonstration on the housing crisis and to use that to launch a nationwide protest campaign to force change on this issue. Last Christmas, we witnessed the occupation of Apollo House in Dublin city centre. Housing activists and homeless people joined forces to occupy a NAMA-owned property. The message was simple: this is the people's property, it should be used to benefit people's lives as should all NAMA properties nationwide. A court case was taken against the campaigners but nobody cared. The attitude of society was it was better to break the law than break the poor. The public support was massive. Hundreds of volunteers stepped forward within days and more than €150,000 in donations was collected within ten days. This public support was a vote of no confidence in the market and in the political establishment to solve the housing crisis. If that occupation had lasted just a small bit longer, it might well have created the space for big water charges-style protests in support. One year on, the housing crisis is worse than ever. Market failure is even more glaring, as is Government failure so what happens now? The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, organises within its ranks 527,000 workers in this State. It is far and away the largest organisation of working people in this country. ICTU members are among those who are crippled by rocketing rents and unaffordable mortgages, and who are spending tonight, in some cases, with their families in emergency accommodation. The trade union movement has a special responsibility towards young people. A total of 500,000 young adults in this State live at home with their parents, very many of them because they cannot afford to buy a home or rent a property. They are the locked out generation. ICTU can and should name the date for a major national housing demonstration. Such a demonstration could demand the declaration of a national housing emergency, massive State investment to directly build social and affordable homes and a ban on economic evictions. It could also be the start for a national campaign which provides for a vehicle for those who want to organise and fight on this issue in every town and city up and down the country.

Governments can take emergency measures, marshal resources in an urgent way, which they would not do in ordinary times, and solve problems but when it comes to Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and, indeed, the Labour Party when it was in government, the emergency measures are always about protecting banks and other financial institutions while refusing to acknowledge the emergency in housing and homelessness even when that causes untold human hardship. My clinic is a tragic litany of cases of people in appalling situations. I had a case of young woman this week, which is heart breaking. She and her two children are in emergency accommodation. She has spent nine years on the housing list and she is close to a mental breakdown. With tears in her eyes, she said, "You know, I have been homeless all my life because before I went on the housing list and ended up in this situation with my two kids, my mother was on the housing list for the previous 15 years without ever getting a council house either and being pushed form Billy to Jack with me as a baby and then a child and now I am in the same situation". What an unbelievable failure of the main political parties in this country to do that to three generations of a family - her mother, herself and now her two young kids. Her case can be repeated again and again and still the Government will not call this an emergency and it refuses to take the emergency action it was so willing to take to ram through legislation to protect banks and financial institutions. As I said in recent weeks, the situation is getting worse and now even all the hotels and hubs are full. There is nowhere for people to go. I could raise many issues but the budget reflected the Government's continued prioritisation of private for-profit interests. Most of the housing budget allocation goes to its friends, the private developers. A total of €750 million was allocated to the Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, agency initiative which will go to private developers with an additional €75 million allocated to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, on top of the €226 million originally allocated to it, an additional €31 million for long-term leasing and an additional €149 million for HAP. All this money goes to the private sector. What will the State get back from that? The Government has no answer to this. Almost none of the housing for which we will finance the private sector, to the tune of almost €1 billion, will be affordable. The LIHAF or HBFI funding is not tied to affordability or to a proportion of affordable housing that will be built. The Government will spend €1 billion on subsidising private developers to build housing at prices that are unaffordable and they will probably pay little tax either. The Government parties are still doing the things that led us into this mess in the first place and the consequences are such that a third generation of families is left in diabolical, unacceptable and immoral housing situations.

I wonder what to say in the three minutes I have. I do not address my comments to the Minister of State or Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party because I have lost all faith. My role and the role of the Opposition is to give confidence to the people outside the House that there are people in here who do not believe the propaganda that the Government is rebuilding Ireland. It is reshaping Ireland in order that the vast majority of our people will never afford a house, will live in accommodation with no security of tenure and will not be able participate in its so-called "republic of opportunity".I sat here and listened to members of the Labour Party, who have left. I point that out because I do not like to speak behind anyone's back. To speak about the Kenny report published in the 1970s, when the Labour Party was in power, is bad enough. The Labour Party was also in the previous Government which had an overwhelming majority but it absolutely failed to use it to deal with the housing crisis. Instead it presided over legislation that fundamentally changed the issue in terms of housing. The Labour Party said that the housing assistance payment in the legislation it introduced in 2014 was the equivalent of social housing. Therefore, if in receipt of a housing assistance payment, a person was considered adequately housed. Naturally, there was outrage about this. People were removed from the housing waiting list and I was accused of being a liar when I said it. At the time I was a lawyer and they might be very close, but it was confirmed by the director of services. The legislation introduced by Fine Gael and the Labour Party said that the only game in town was the housing assistance payment, and a person was removed from the waiting list once he or she got it. I understand the position now is that the person is put on a transfer list. Therefore, to get to the truth of how many households are on a waiting list, one has to consider the waiting list, the transfer list and those who have are in long-term leasing.  The Government persists with its spin that it is building social housing. The local authority in Galway has given up giving us figures. In April of this year, its quarterly report does not give us figures. The figure for September of last year was 4,720 households. That is somewhere between 13,000 and 15,000 people on a waiting list since 2002, with not a hope of a house. Last Saturday week, I sat in an apartment that is about to be sold, and it is one of two groups of apartments. The tenants have already been evicted so that the landlord can do Airbnb. Those tenants fought and did their best but, in the end, had to look after themselves and try to find alternatives. I will stop for my colleague. I beg her pardon.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	337	I will start by referring to a headline - Republic of Homeless? - which was followed by some facts: 8,270 homeless people; 3,048 homeless children; more than 73,000 mortgages in arrears; 120,000 people on local authority housing lists; 141 repossessions taking place per month; two families becoming homeless per day; 46% of all homeless people are under 24 years of age; life expectancy for a homeless woman is 38; life expectancy for a homeless man is 42; and 8,000 units being built but there is demand for 25,000. This does not include those who are struggling to pay exorbitant rents in the private sector such as young workers who have to move away from home and pay more than 50% of their income in rent. Students who moved to main urban areas or come from outside the State to attend college have huge difficulty in finding affordable housing. Another headline stated "hide the bunkbeds" as a major slum landlord operation was uncovered and it was revealed that more than 40 houses and apartments in slum conditions were being run by a group. This is a crisis and it requires urgent action. It is an emergency and should be declared as such, and I commend Deputy Healy on tabling this Private Members' motion tonight. Two weeks ago we had a non-event of a budget from Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Government of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. It was a budget that did nothing to alleviate widespread consistent poverty affecting 140,000 children or to recognise the crisis of our health service. Yesterday a leading medical expert predicted the collapse of the health service if we have a serious outbreak of 'flu this winter. It was a budget that completely failed to recognise the housing and homelessness crisis. We probably have had a Private Members' motion on housing every week since we returned from the summer recess and I support this motion. However, I am convinced that we will get no movement on this crisis unless a mass movement is built outside this building, a movement on the streets to unify hundreds of thousands who are affected in one way or another and to demand a new approach based on the right to housing as opposed to the right to profit for developers, landlords, vulture funds, hotels and banks. Right2Change is organising a conference on 4 November, Saturday week, and will be discussing this and, my God, we will see people out on the streets shortly.

Everyone knows that there is a housing crisis, especially in the major cities. Approximately one year ago, I proposed a points system, which other countries have used, as it may attract people to move to other areas. They may not want to go to there long-term but they would get points that would give them priority on the housing list in an area they wanted when a house became available. We should examine that as an option. We can speak here every night about housing but the fact is that this crisis will not be resolved happen overnight. There is no point in saying otherwise. Houses do not go up in a matter of days. We have to make sure, however, that we have a way to do it. The Department may be good at policy, with many documents having been published, and councils may be good at planning, but one thing is missing, which is delivery and knowing how to build houses fast. This is a huge problem. There is another problem and it is happening in our own neck of the woods in the west of Ireland. Some of the councils did not put in for enough money to the Department. It is embarrassing that those things happen when we need to ensure that there is delivery of houses. A genuine effort to speed up things is needed. We have seen all the paperwork and all the different policies for the past number of years but houses are not being put on the ground. Unless we ramp that up fast, we will see more of the problem. Further, during the formation of Government talks, I put forward a proposal about colleges borrowing money to build student accommodation, which would alleviate a bit, not all, of the problem in many cities. At long last, and it was only today or yesterday that it came to fruition, I see that they are starting to do it in Galway, but it needs to be ramped up. A huge amount of land is available on many of these campuses. They can facilitate the youngsters and thereby help those who are in trouble with homelessness.

Killarney is no different from many other places in that there is a significant housing list and houses are scarce at the present time. Anything from €900 to €1,200 per month is being asked in rent for houses but the maximum rent allowable under the housing assistance payment scheme is approximately €550. Killarney is also unusual in that most of the land south of the town is prime amenity. It includes the national park, Killarney House and lands and Muckross House and lands. However, we are now awaiting the local area plan for Killarney for 12 months to 18 months. There were many instances where there was phase 1 and phase 2. In phase 1, the lands were held up because the people had no money or whatever. In phase 2, people were prepared to go. I want to tell the Minister of State that there is no hoarding in Killarney. Many people are waiting for the draft plan from Kerry County Council. The Department has a role in ensuring that more land is allowed to be zoned residential, as was allowed heretofore. I am asking the Department to increase the amount so zoned. It is wrong to confine the amount of land that is zoned. If only so many property owners' land is zoned, they have a monopoly, which means that they can charge more and it is the person buying the house who will pay the piper. It is very unfair. Zoning should not happen at all. If an application is made, it should be up to the local authorities to decide that it is worthwhile, that it meets all the requirements and that all the services are available where they are being built, etc.It takes up a lot of time and in many instances it finishes up being very unfair.  The repair and leasing scheme should be extended to rural towns and villages. It only operates where there is pressure for social housing. Most rural areas, towns and villages are practically dead. If the Government is serious about bringing people back to revitalise them, it will have to extend the repair and leasing scheme to apply to rural areas. I have highlighted many times in the House that 80% of people applying for the tenant purchase scheme are being disallowed. It is very unfair that pensioners who have lived in a house for 30 or 40 years and now have the wherewithal to purchase it are being denied the right to purchase it. That is very wrong. The Minister of State should look into that.

It is a case of speak no evil, hear no evil and see no evil. The housing policies are a disaster and were so long before the recession kicked in because the Government gave in to the private sector. The councils had stopped building. There is an argument there. The councils do not get the money but the Government says it gave it to them. Deputy Fitzmaurice said a minute ago that the councils had not applied for enough money. We have heard different announcements and Rebuilding Ireland is the latest coupled with "an Ireland of opportunities". Where are the opportunities? The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is the biggest disaster ever implemented. Who brought it in? It was AK47 himself, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. He was going to sort everything out. He would not build. Where is he tonight? Where is the Labour Party? It was the party that looked after the working man, ordinary families, small farmers and business people over the years in my county, with Members such as Seán Treacy, the late John Ryan, Michael Ferris and many others. They had the confidence of the ordinary people. The party does not have that now because it got into bed with Fine Gael which was not interested in the ordinary people. It never was. It will hardly be interested now. Scheme after scheme will be launched and there will be conferences and announcements. I am on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, but I do not bother going to the meetings because they are futile. The schemes are all built like sandcastles. At the first drop of water that comes inshore, they disappear. They are not realisable or achievable because the Government does not understand the basics of allowing the county councils to build the houses and providing them with the wherewithal to do that. On the other hand, there are many young couples in my constituency who have employment and sites, thank God. They have engaged agents to design houses and apply for planning permission but they cannot get it. Every obstacle in the book is put before them. It may be that it is a designated area, such as a special area of conservation, SAC, but ordinary people, even farmers' sons or daughters, have no hope unless they are farming 25 ha or more. There has to be only one person farming. It is a case of to hell or to Connaught. They could house themselves and the Government will not allow them. It is herding them into towns, but it will not allow schemes in towns, such as conversion of shops that are closed to housing. There has to be change of use and planning fees, and the fees and development charges are high. It is not viable. It is not profitable for small builders to build a house. The banks will not give a penny to anybody to build a house. They are not functioning as far as ordinary people are concerned. We have seen what has happened with the tracker mortgages, repossessions and how the courts are not protecting people. They are evicting people by the week. A child in senior infants could do the arithmetic to show that the Government is putting more people out of houses every week than it is building houses for and the crisis gets worse. I walked down the street near here this evening and saw massive building sites with towering cranes, all development of offices. I welcome that because it brings jobs, but where are those people going to live? The Government has put the cart before the horse. It has lost its way completely as regards housing. The Labour Party totally acquiesced in that and denied the people the right to get a home, and denied their rights under the Constitution. It is a far cry from the Labour Party that was founded in Clonmel. The Government got away with that but the people gave it a severe wallop, as the then Taoiseach said, but it will get more of them because it is not doing anything to help ordinary people get housing.

This motion calls on the Government to exercise its powers under the Constitution to tackle this unprecedented crisis in housing and homelessness in our country. Yesterday the European Committee of Social Rights published a decision delivered in May of this year in the case of the International Federation of Human Rights v. Ireland, concluding that Ireland violated Article 16 of the Revised European Social Charter due to its "unsatisfactory protection against poverty and social exclusion of persons living in local authority housing estates". This is a damning indictment of our country. The case was taken in 2014 in respect of substandard State housing. What the decision really highlights is how the Government has failed the family unit, which is protected under Article 16 of the revised European Social Charter. It is not just in respect of substandard buildings that this Government fails the family unit. Children and families who are now homeless are suffering, and their health, well-being and education are being adversely affected. How many people must be homeless for the Government to recognise that this is an unprecedented emergency? Will it be the fact that there are now 3,000 children without a place to call home? Are 1,429 homeless families, a rise of 25% in the last year, not enough? We need homes for these families, not hubs. Surely it is way past time for the Government to declare a housing and homelessness emergency. The Green Party is happy to support this motion and commends Deputy Healy on bringing it before the House. The Government lacks vision and strategic planning when it comes to the scale of the housing and homelessness crisis which severely affects the most vulnerable in our society. It is time for the Government to view housing as a human right and one that must be enshrined within our Constitution. In the past four years there have been four Ministers with responsibility for housing. This is indicative of the Government's track record and shows the level of genuine intent, level of priority and respect for the role of this Ministry which is at the centre of the biggest crisis of our time. There has been no continuity, no stability and no appropriate demonstration from this Government of the level of priority and real action the crisis clearly and urgently needs. In the recent budget, in seeking to do a little for everyone, the Government ended up doing nothing significant for anyone. It did very little for some of the most vulnerable in our society, those who are without a home and those who are trying to deal with an unsustainable and unaffordable property market. These are people whom the State is failing and leaving on incredibly long housing lists or in an unaffordable housing market with skyrocketing house prices and forced to rent without any security of tenure. The recent announcement by the Government of its intention to increase the vacant site levy is to be welcomed. However, it is a shame that earlier this year, in February, when my Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, introduced the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill in the Seanad, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael chose to vote against it. I welcome the Government's recognition now that this increase is needed, but it still demonstrates this Government's lack of ambition and its inability to do anything other than take minute steps to tackle big problems as this increase will not come into full force until at least 2019. The budget could have seen a shift to focusing on a cost-rental model of local authority building.Instead, the Government is continuing with its outdated logic that the private market alone can fix the crisis in housing and homelessness. In the words of former Chief Secretary in Dublin Castle, Thomas Drummond in 1838, "property has its duties as well as its rights". Our Constitution is quite strong in recognising property rights but it also recognises the need of the common good to be served, which must prioritise the needs of those most vulnerable in our society. Unfortunately, this Government does not seem to recognise or be willing to act on that fact. It is absolutely unacceptable that the lack of real action we have seen from the Government continues. The Green Party will support this motion to show that the Dáil not only recognises the scale of the problem but the urgent and pressing need to take immediate and effective action.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	344	I thank Deputy Healy for tabling the motion. I know it is genuine and that most people's comments in this debate and in the debates on housing and homelessness we have had here have been pretty much genuine. I understand that. We might not agree with all parts of the motion but most people want to see the housing situation sorted for social and private housing because it affects many of us. I thank Members for their interest in that as well and for the chance to go through some of the topics raised here tonight. As Deputy Healy highlighted in his introductory comments, we are experiencing an unprecedented housing crisis that is impacting on many households and many types of household across the country. They include those facing rents rising beyond their means; families who are finding it difficult to repay their mortgages and who are at risk of losing their homes; first-time buyers who are priced out of the market because of the lack of supply, particularly in the starter home bracket; individuals driven to rough sleeping; and families in hotels and hubs, which are not suitable for anybody. It is not just social housing. As Deputy MacSharry said earlier, it also affects investment and job creation and we understand that. Companies that I used to deal with many years ago in my previous ministerial role are coming forward to say that it is difficult to invest and plan ahead for more employees when they are concerned that there might not be houses to house them in years to come. It has certainly become a big issue. Part of the work of the Department is to sit down with people to show what is going to happen in the years ahead and to show the progress and the trends that we believe will help solve the housing crisis. We all know we cannot solve it in one week, two months or three months but over the next couple of years, we will solve the housing crisis and emergency. We are having an impact. The trends are there. When one sits down and analyses the data, not spin or rhetoric but facts, one will see that there is progress in housing supply and social housing delivery. It is not enough by any means but people need to acknowledge that it is far better than it was two years ago in terms of the supply of housing and movement when it comes to sites and social housing provision. I know it is not enough to deal with the housing crisis or homelessness issue. I am not saying it is but I would say to people who come in here week after week and accuse the Minister and me along with others of rhetoric and spin that this is not what we are about. We are being very straight about this and have been from the start in terms of dealing with homelessness figures, admitting what they are and putting through various actions and plans to deal with them. We put the figures out week in, week out and month in, month out for people to track and see what is happening. That is not spin. Facts are not spin. I must question whether some of the rhetoric here is spin because it does not deal with the facts. Even Deputy Mattie McGrath came in here again tonight and said we are not listening, yet when I try to correct what he says every week, he does not want to listen to it, so it works both ways. I have no problem admitting there is a major housing crisis and saying the Government is finding it difficult to solve it but I will not be told week in, week out that we are doing nothing about it or nothing has changed because that is not true. If we are going to genuinely approach this issue, let us approach it in a logical manner and deal with the facts. The Deputy from Galway spoke about HAP being a failure and argued that it is not a good scheme. That is not true either because thousands of people availing of the HAP scheme find it a great scheme because it solves their housing problems. They know it is not a permanent solution. We all know that. It is a temporary solution, in some cases, for three, four or five years while in other cases, it solves the problem for a year or two, but HAP is helping thousands of people. Next year, another 17,000 people will be helped through the HAP scheme. The HAP scheme is a reformed rent assistance scheme that had been there for many years. Thousands of people used it and people came in here and said it was a great scheme. There is one fundamental problem with that scheme that I disliked and discussed with Deputy Burton many years ago when she was Minister. A person could not go back to work if they were on the rent allowance scheme. As soon as a person went back to work or increased their income, bang, their rent support was gone. That is not the situation with HAP and that is why most people, or certainly people who claim they are on the left, should welcome it because it is a housing assistance payment that does not drop off if a person gets a job or increases his or her employment. It is a very useful scheme. It is not one that we will rely on forever but we recognise that while we are trying to increase the number of social houses, we need to rely on private schemes in some cases. That is what HAP is for. It recognises that there are not enough houses in the social housing stock for everyone who needs a house so, yes, we have to rent houses in the short term. When we implement this plan, we will have increased the housing stock by over one third and will be in a position to be able to offer people a more permanent housing solution as opposed to just a HAP house. People should not keep saying it is not working. Yes, there are individual cases where it does not solve individual problems but for thousands upon thousands, it is working and they are very happy with it. If one asked them to move tomorrow, they would not move so let us just deal with some facts here rather than the spin from the other side. It is said here week after week that this Government does not believe in social housing and that Fine Gael is against social housing. That is untrue. Before we came into office, a decision was made here to restrict the number of social houses being directly built by local authorities, to wind down capacity and to pull the funding. The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government made changes to that and the following Fine Gael Government supported by Fianna Fáil has followed through and is making changes to put local authorities back into the business of driving the provision of social housing. Of the 33,000 plus houses that will be built directly as opposed to leased under Rebuilding Ireland, local authorities are driving the majority and are central to that. They are in charge of social housing and rightly so and most of the €6 billion we spend on housing has been spent by them. Again, factually, it is wrong to say we are doing nothing or we are against social housing. It is just not true because the money is there. The figure of €1.9 billion for housing this year is the largest housing budget ever in this State. It is factually untrue to say that as a Fine Gael-led Government, we are against social housing. It is just not true because the figures speak for themselves. We are investing where we can. Yes, it does not solve the problem today but it will solve it over the months and years ahead if we continue with that investment and that is what we are doing. We are also repeatedly told that we are not providing enough social houses and yet everyone quotes the housing committee formed early last year, which suggested that the Government should deliver 10,000 social houses per year and 50,000 in total over five years. Everyone says that is the figure it should achieve and yet nobody realises that this is exactly what we are doing in Rebuilding Ireland. It is the exact same figure. Our commitment is 50,000 social housing units outside of HAP over the next five years. That is what we are doing so we are actually matching the committee that all the Members praise. Again, the facts do not add up here. I ask people that when they come in to this Chamber week in, week out to let us look at the facts. I accept hand over heart that it is not enough to solve the problem but we are doing more. We are putting more money in and we will try more schemes because we want to solve this. Nobody is happy with the homeless situation. Deputies quoted the figures from the times we are in but if we look back over the homeless figures for even the good times such as 2006, nearly 4,000 individuals were homeless. It is different now because we now have families that are homeless who were not homeless ten or 15 years ago. We really must concentrate on that aspect and it is where we are putting most of our resources. It is why we are opening family hubs to recognise that there are now families that are homeless, including thousands of children. The family hubs are a better form of emergency housing. They are not permanent and are not meant to be permanent. In some cases, they are for three or four months while in other cases, they are for six or seven months as people transition from an emergency situation in a bed and breakfast accommodation, hotel or even the street into a hub and then on to a house. They are working quite well. Again, people in the family hubs say that they are a lot better than what they had before that. They know it is not the end solution and we know that too. We must get them a house and we will. Deal with the facts and talk to those who are living in these situations.  Other issues were raised - I have probably gone off my main speech - such as the repair and leasing scheme, which I believe is a great scheme. We provided the money for it but it will not reach its target because it is being under-utilised. We offered the scheme but it is demand-led. The public needs to say "Yes" to it. It is privately driven.We have repeatedly asked councillors, political parties and local authorities to support the scheme and push it out there, yet the number of applications around the country is only about 600. It is wrong to say it is not available for rural areas or small towns and villages because it absolutely is. It is available not only in high-pressure areas for social housing but also where there is a demand or need for any social housing. It does not matter what town it is. It could be in Kenmare, which is close to where Deputy Danny Healy-Rae is from, if there is a need for a social house there. That scheme solves two problems. It gets people a social house and it helps repair dereliction and the decline of villages and towns. It will do so over many years, not just over five but probably 50 years. It is a good scheme and it is there for that reason. On the issue of zoning of land, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae raised the point about Kerry. I said it last week and I will say it again, that in most cities, towns and villages we zone 50% above what we believe is needed to allow for a situation in which not every site is brought forward. We can do that more if a councillor comes to us with evidence to prove more land is required to be zoned. That is part of my remit in the Department. We apply common sense and we will do that if it is required. In most cases and in many of our counties there is sufficient land zoned to deliver housing. We need to activate it and make it possible. Numerous schemes in Rebuilding Ireland are about activating these sites and providing the money for the infrastructure to open up the sites. There are many different schemes. We brought forward a fund to finance small builders who cannot get access to funding. People talk about it here as if there is a grant. It is not a grant. It is a loan on a commercial basis which will be repaid. It is utilising finances in a clever way to activate housing. Any money we spend on infrastructure to open up sites will be reflected in the price of the house that is sold back.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate and in particular to address the amendments tabled by the Government of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party. It is important to note that none of the amendments challenges the fundamental principle of the motion. Therefore, it is very clear it is totally within the law to bring forward measures which, in the public interest, impinge on private property rights in matters relating to housing, in accordance with Articles 43.2.1° and 43.2.2° of Bunreacht na hÉireann. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in his contribution indicated I wanted either to suspend or change the Constitution. Nothing could be further from the truth. I made it quite plain that my proposal was to use the existing provisions of Bunreacht na hÉireann, subject to the exigencies of the common good, as the articles say, to declare a housing emergency and to deal with amendments that are needed to ensure the housing and homelessness emergency is dealt with urgently. The Minister also said his policy is working and that is what his amendment says. However, I can tell him that nobody I know believes that. The Minister should ask any of the advocacy groups or Brother Kevin who deals with homeless people hourly and daily. He should ask the many volunteers who are running soup kitchens all over this country, including those running the soup kitchen at the historic GPO in O'Connell Street in Dublin, the site of the 1916 Rising. He should ask the volunteers running the soup kitchen at the railway station in my home town of Clonmel. They will all tell the Minister that not enough is being done and that the situation is getting worse. What do some of the advocacy groups say? Focus Ireland in the past fortnight said "We’re never going to tackle this problem if we don’t reduce the flow of people coming into homelessness." Its representative went on to say, "There is a failure to understand how critical that obvious point is that you need to cut the numbers coming in and not just look at the emergency measures when they're homeless." He went on to say:This is a question of ideology. It's putting property rights ahead of the rights of tenants.What did the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice say just a week ago? It said, "Rebuilding Ireland, the Government’s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, relies far too heavily on market-based solutions to the problems facing Irish housing." For this reason it predicts the plan will fail in its stated objective of developing a housing system that is affordable, stable and sustainable. It went on to say that despite the efforts of the Government over the 15 months since Rebuilding Ireland was published, homelessness has increased by 27%, asking prices for houses have risen by 12%, and new rental prices have increased by 11.8%. The availability of rented properties within the limits for the various rent supplement schemes have diminished. It goes on to say that the policy of the past 25 years has led to a chronic undersupply of real social housing and has resulted in the homelessness crisis we are now experiencing and in the trebling of the number of households on housing waiting lists between 1996 and 2016. The social policy officer with the centre went on to say, "As we mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we need to recognise that housing deprivation is one of the most serious forms of poverty in the Ireland of today and that in recent years the housing system has become the locus of some of the deepest inequality evident in our society." She went on to say that the Jesuit centre is calling for a new direction for housing policy in Ireland, one based on recognising that housing is a fundamental human right. What did Fr. Peter McVerry say as recently as 18 October? He said "Unless we prevent more people coming into the system, then trying to house homeless people is like trying to empty the bath water with the tap still running." He went on to say:It should be made illegal to evict people into homelessness, particularly families. That’s what we did during the famine years and we’re still doing it today in 2017.He said:Basically, I think, this whole question of housing, you have to take on vested interests. You have to take on the banks. You have to take on the greedy landlords. You have to take on the vulture funds. You have to take on big vested interests. I think that is what this conservative Government is not prepared to do.Nobody believes that what the Government is doing to tackle the crisis in housing and homelessness is enough. The Government is burying its head in the sand. The Fianna Fáil amendment is one of its usual spin. Fianna Fáil started the privatisation of social housing. It handed the building of social houses over to its builder and developer friends. It stopped local authorities building social and affordable houses. I recall quite well when I was a member of South Tipperary County Council that the policy was announced at a council meeting. I said at the time it would end in grief, and it has. It has led to the slippery slope of the housing and homeless emergency we have today. It has led to a tripling of the numbers on the housing waiting lists since 1996. The Labour Party amendment is totally disingenuous. It claims the Kenny report would apparently now survive constitutional scrutiny. The Kenny report, which people may or may not know, was published in 1974 and dealt with the price of building land. That means, 43 years later, the Labour Party finds it would survive constitutional scrutiny. It sounds to me very much like the conversion of Saul on the road to Damascus. One must remember that in those 43 years, the Labour Party was in government on no fewer than three occasions and had senior housing Ministers. It did absolutely nothing to implement that report. The amendment also states that "the power of the Oireachtas to impose restrictions on [private] property rights in the public interest is by now constitutionally well established". However, Deputy Howlin introduced the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation which he said required the declaration of a housing emergency and a certification of that emergency to ensure the private property rights of pensioners could be reduced and withheld.A previous Labour Party Minister with responsibility for housing regularly indicated that he was prevented from introducing rent control measures because of constitutional difficulties. Of course, the Labour Party Attorney General gave advice that it was unconstitutional to give sitting tenants the right to continue their tenancies in cases of sale. This was disingenuous, to say the least. Deputies Mick Barry and Joan Collins referred to the need for a major national housing campaign outside the House. I agree that one will be needed if we are to deal with the housing and homelessness emergency. The amendments tabled by the Government, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party indicate that they are prepared to formally declare a financial emergency and to use it to remove a considerable portion of the private property of public service pensioners on quite low incomes, but when it comes to the private property of vulture funds, banks and the Irish super-rich, they are unwilling to take similar measures to tackle the homelessness crisis. I, therefore, again propose the motion to enable those who are suffering in the housing emergency to be rescued urgently from their awful plight. I appeal to all Members, particularly backbenchers, to support the motion. There could be no more appropriate way to honour the memory of Pádraig Mac Piarais, the other 1916 Rising leaders and the Deputies in the Thirty-two Counties who voted through the primacy of human welfare over private property in the democratic programme of the First Dáil in 1919. I commend the motion to the House.
