I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need not to cut respite services and I call on the Government to support all adults and children with a disability, with proper backup services and resources, and to make this a priority issue.  A Cheann Comhairle, following the call I made yesterday for a debate on cystic fibrosis, have you or the Government considered the priority of having a serious discussion on the cystic fibrosis services at St. Vincent's hospital, in order to find out what exactly is going on out there?

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of national and local importance, namely, the loss of over 100 jobs in Longford at B3 Cables, which is a huge blow to the county, the midlands and the country, as this company is one of the major employers in Longford.  Given the shocking increase in unemployment, with the associated human suffering from the economic fall out, it is another nail in the coffin of the supposed recovery.  It is a tragedy for the workforce in Longford and I would appreciate if you would give us an opportunity today to discuss this matter.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It is not agreed.  Deputy O'Donnell has pointed out on a number of occasions the importance of the ECB 11 page opinion in respect of the legislation being proposed by the Minister for Finance.  There were 15 separate issues outlined in that opinion in respect of the independence of the Central Bank and the Governor.  One of the main criticisms was the weakness in Ireland's regulatory system whereby it was open to political and financial pressure from interest groups.  It is not right that the Bill should be guillotined in this fashion.  Both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party have warned for the last four or five weeks that this is the usual style of the Government towards the end of a session, whereby it guillotines practically every Bill that comes through the House.  This is one Bill that should not be guillotined.  It is absolutely critical, in view of the gross incompetence and mismanagement of regulatory affairs by the Government, that this Bill be debated thoroughly and that the serious opinions expressed in the ECB report be taken into account in this House.  In view of the gross incompetence, mismanagement and oversight of regulatory affairs by the Government, it is absolutely critical that this Bill be debated thoroughly and completely and that the serious opinions expressed in the ECB 11-page report be taken into account in this House.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Today we learned that Ireland has come first in something.  We have come first in the league table for having the worst bank in the world.  We are told today that Anglo Irish Bank is the biggest loss-maker of any bank in the world, and that is on top of the fact that the Irish bank bailout is the most expensive bailout anywhere in the world.  Yet the Government is proposing to guillotine the debate on the Central Bank Reform Bill, which deals with regulatory matters governing banks, at 1 p.m. today.  Some 56 amendments to the Bill have been tabled for discussion.  By the time the debate on the Bill adjourned last night the House had reached the fourth of those amendments.  There is no possibility that those 56 amendments will be dealt with, and certainly not dealt with adequately, by 1 p.m. today.  On the day we discover we have the worst bank in the world——

Substantial amendments have been put forward by Opposition Members in this Chamber and there will not be an opportunity to address those if the guillotine applies to the debate on the Bill as the Government proposes.Why does the Government continue to deal with the banks and the financial institutions with deference and kid gloves?  There is no indication or evidence, following the significant bailout of the banks by the Irish taxpayer, which will be a millstone around the neck of this generation for the rest of our lives and perhaps our children's too, that there is a willingness on the part of the Government to take the banks by the scruff of the neck and deal with them as they should be dealt with in terms of regulation and how they perform in regard to meeting the needs of society and of their customer base.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The Deputy should not anticipate the debate on the Bill that will take place later.

That attitude was demonstrated again last evening in the Government's address of the amendments tabled to this Bill.  It is shameful and I absolutely object to this legislation being pressed through, which is a totally inadequate response to what is needed now.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Government and the Minister for Finance are most anxious to bring in reform of the regulatory frameworks we have in this country, and it is on that basis this type of legislation is being brought to the House.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	22	There was more than 15.5 hours of debate on Second Stage of the Bill.  To ensure this legislation is passed by both Houses prior to the summer recess, the Government is anxious that it would be passed here.  It is on that basis we are not in a position to change the order.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I am now putting the question.

I object to that as I have done in the case of other legislation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Three and a half hours have been allocated for Report and Final Stages of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009.  There are 127 amendments to be dealt with, one of which, amendment No. 120, is ten pages long.This matter was raised by the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Seán Fleming, with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which I understand made a decision on it last night.  The complaint made by Deputy Fleming on behalf of the select committee was that the Bill, as presented for Committee Stage, originally comprised 40 sections laid out over 40 pages and included an explanatory memorandum.  However, 128 Committee Stage amendments laid out over 100 pages were presented for consideration and no revised explanatory memorandum was provided to Members.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Bill being presented and being complained about is to be rushed through in three and a half hours without the explanatory memoranda sought by Deputy Fleming or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This is a planning Bill — if a planning applicant came in at the last minute with additional information that was two and a half times the size of the original planning application, we would be going to An Bord Pleanála with it.

It is just not acceptable and it is bad, bad politics for the Government to press ahead.  The Minister and the Green Party have many times in the past made the case on the floor of this Chamber that rushed legislation is flawed legislation but they seem not to apply that when they have an opportunity to influence the course and passage of legislation themselves.  It is absolutely unacceptable and we strongly object to it.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I can appreciate the annoyance of the members of the committee where explanatory memoranda were not made available.  I note that and will ensure that in future all Departments are advised that explanatory memoranda on significant changes must be made available to Members.This is complex legislation.  It deals with the European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland on the non-transposition of the environmental impact assessments, habitats and public participation directives.  If it is not enacted before the summer recess, Ireland will incur serious and heavy fines.

Second Stage took longer than 12 hours and on the basis of the necessity to ensure we do not incur heavy fines, we are proposing this legislation is brought forward.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I will oppose this item.  I thank the Tánaiste for apologising to the House on behalf of the Government for what has happened and I acknowledge her remarks that there was a 12 hour debate on Second Stage but these amendments were submitted by the Minister after the Second Stage debate had concluded.We are talking about planning legislation, which is complex at the best of times.  The problems have been compounded in that not only do we have a long list of amendments, the debate is being guillotined so they will not be reached and discussed.  On top of that, there are no explanatory memoranda to explain what these changes to the planning law amount to.  We are changing planning law without being given time to debate it and without the courtesy of explanatory memoranda being circulated so individual Members on all sides know what the changes in the planning law will be.  There are 100 pages of these amendments.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Does the Government intend to introduce legislation to deal with the position of the taxpayer continuing to guarantee Anglo Irish Bank?  As the leader of the Labour Party pointed out, the Government surely must have some sense of what it has got the country into, in view of the fact that Anglo Irish Bank has had losses twice as big as the US Citigroup bank, despite the fact that the Irish economy is 100 times smaller than that of the US.  Is it intended to save the Irish taxpayer money by introducing legislation to make those who invested and speculated in Anglo Irish Bank share some of the pain?With regard to NAMA, is it intended that the Dáil will have an opportunity next week to discuss the quarterly report submitted to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the changes to the NAMA business plan that have been introduced?  We now know that developers have been looking for €1.5 billion in working capital from NAMA, loan covenants have been waived by NAMA and developers have sought to transfer assets outside the jurisdiction.  We need to discuss these and many other issues of critical importance so the people know exactly what is going on.  Will we have an opportunity next week to hear what are the changes in the revised NAMA business plan and to have a discussion on the quarterly report that was submitted?I understand the Dáil may not meet again until mid-September.  That seems to be the proposed resumption time.  This means it is most likely that legislation yet to be published on the Dublin mayoral election will not be passed in 2010, despite the fact that only last week a spokesman for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated the election would take place in October.  What is the position on this?  Is the legislation to be published during the summer recess?  Is it to be debated and passed prior to October?  Are we to have mayoral elections this year?With regard to the mission statement of the Health Service Executive, it has now transpired, as a result of forensic analysis by Deputy Shatter, that the HSE never intended to publish the reports into the deaths of David Foley and Tracey Fay, go ndéana Dia trócaire orthu.  It did launch an urgent investigation into how the report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, including an analysis of computers held by the HSE.  What is the position of the Government in view of the fact that there was a deliberate intent never to publish those two reports, which in the public interest Deputy Shatter dealt with?  Recently, the CEO of the HSE stated it would be better off and much more efficient had it not to deal with the issue of children in the first place.  What is the Government's response to this?Will the Tánaiste respond to the question on the position on cystic fibrosis, which she stated would be responded to today?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The revised bank guarantee scheme to implement the new expiry date will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval prior to the end of September.  It is secondary legislation but will be brought to both Houses for discussion.  I am not sure we will have time available next week to discuss the NAMA business plan on the basis that a number of pieces of legislation must go through the House.  It is hoped the legislation on the Dublin mayor will be printed during the summer.With regard to the HSE report, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has dealt with this.  The matter is in hand and will be public knowledge.  I beg the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle to allow the Deputy who raised the matter of cystic fibrosis, Deputy Finian McGrath, to raise it now and I will respond to him.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	49	On a point of order, I raised the issues of the importance of the crisis regarding cystic fibrosis patients at St. Vincent's hospital, in particular the fact that they do not have en-suite rooms.  There has been a delay and a cock up recently in regard to this project.  I have asked the Tánaiste and Government if they would seriously consider having a debate on the provision of services for patients with cystic fibrosis.  We have had late sittings this week and debates on stag hunting.  It is important that we have a debate on cystic fibrosis services.  What are the plans for such a debate?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I reiterate that the provision of a new ward unit at St. Vincent's hospital for the support of those who suffer from cystic fibrosis is absolutely fundamental to this Government.  We will proceed with it.  I have agreed with the Whip and I understand it was discussed with the Opposition Whips that we would provide time next week for a discussion on this matter.

She will recall that when we had a discussion on this yesterday the Labour Party Whip requested that there would be such a discussion.  I understand it was discussed by the Whips and I am glad that time is being provided for it.I am sure the Tánaiste will have seen the report on the decision made yesterday by the Taxing Master to reduce by 82% what he regarded as a grossly excessive legal bill from lawyers in a particular case and expressed his "disgust and bewilderment" at the level of costs claimed.

The legal costs Bill is promised to provide for the regulation and assessment of legal costs and publication is expected in 2011.  Given that an OECD report on legal costs which recommended reform of the legal profession was published in 2001 and, subsequently, a Competition Authority report was published on the same area, I ask the Tánaiste and Government to consider bringing forward the publication of the legal costs Bill——

This is a very alarming further exposure of the HSE's disposition to the issue of State care provision for children.  It again lays emphasis on the need for specific steps to be taken in regard to the referendum on children's rights, which we hope to have in 2010, that was addressed substantively with the Taoiseach yesterday and for which we remain absolutely uncertain as to the Government's position.  There is no clarity on other critical areas of legislation.The first report of the all-party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which was unanimous, commended to Government the introduction of what it has now termed the national vetting bureau Bill, the publication of which is expected in 2010.  Again, there is no sight of this Bill.  We have to address all these issues with urgency——

I ask the Tánaiste, on the national vetting bureau Bill, if the Government will ensure that it is published immediately or upon the resumption of the new term following the summerrecess.Yesterday, I received a reply from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, to a parliamentary question asking for a list of State properties on which ground rent is still being paid.

If the unchallenged costs are allowed to remain what are the likely implications?  As Deputy Gilmore said, would it not be advisable to bring the Bill before the House as a matter as urgency?  Otherwise, there is a danger that we will be regarded as only being here for cosmetic purposes.  Is there any possibility that the Government might focus on that?  It has huge financial implications for the State in the event of it not coming before the House as the Deputy suggested.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Is there legislation?

It has been dragged on.  The people outside this House know it will be dragged on indefinitely.  Unless something of a serious nature is done, this issue will continue.  Somebody will stand up in this House in two, three, four or five years' time and ask why this Bill was not brought forward in time.  Does the Tánaiste recognise the possible implications of that?

I want to know whether she is aware of the financial implications for this State of the failure to introduce the legislation.  I have made my point.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The Deputy's point is well made.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I ask the Tánaiste about the judicial misconduct Bill. A report in The Irish Times earlier this week set out the implications of not having this Bill.  When allegations made against a member of the Judiciary had to be processed under a constitutional arrangement by an Oireachtas committee, we received a bill of €1.9 million from lawyers for the judge concerned.  A personal injury case involving a modest award was processed through the courts and thereby accrued lawyers’ fees of €2.1 million.  The Taxing Master thought it necessary to reduce these fees by 82%.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The Deputy needs to find another way to pursue the matter.

A certain sheltered professional class which apparently has no regard for the environment in which we live is extorting extraordinary and unjustifiable fees.  The Government needs to address the issue.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The judicial council Bill will provide effective remedies for complaints about judicial misbehaviour, including lay participation in the investigation of complaints.

This is not good enough.  Some 63 families in my constituency have no respite care for their adult family members with intellectual disabilities.  One mother who needs to go into hospital can find nowhere to put her 41 year old son and must bring him with her.  I will not leave the House next week until I get an answer.

I telephoned the Ceann Comhairle's office five or six times and was told to raise it in a general rather than a specific manner.  When I raised it on the Adjournment I received a general and waffling answer which ignored the issue of respite care.  The majority of the parents of the 63 adults concerned are elderly and many of them are living alone.  The sum required is €150,000 and it is not good enough to be given the run around by the Minister and the Government.  We are now unable to ask a question in this House on respite services for 63 families.

By closing respite care facilities, we are now taking away the bit of help we can offer.  It is penny wise but pound foolish and it must be addressed before the Houses rises for the summer or else these people will be left without respite for the rest of the year.  There will be detrimental effects on the health of carers and many of their wards will end up in full-time care as a result.

I am not aware of whether there has been any change from his response.  I am aware, however, this is an issue of grave concern.  When the Taoiseach spoke about it during Leaders' Questions on Tuesday, he indicated that substantial resources were being made available.  However, in trying to work within available resources the HSE and voluntary sector were working to ensure frontline services would be paramount.  This work is ongoing.  When I see the Minister, who I believe is attending an event, I will inform her that this matter was raised by the Deputy and a number of other Deputies from Limerick and ask her office to revert to them.

I believe work on this matter has commenced with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  An expert report commissioned by the Minister at the time recommended an electoral commission.  The Minister's intention in this matter — I recall the issue coming before the Government — was noted during a Cabinet meeting in May.  Electoral reform is being considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which is holding public hearings on the matter and is due to report in the coming weeks.  This process is proceeding in tandem with the preparation of legislation.  I will obtain a further update for the Deputy.

If not, will they be completed before the recess?  I raise this matter owing to my concern about an announcement last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Alexandra White, who, in disapproving of a pamphlet issued by the Migrant Rights Centre, stated: "My office, as the responsible authority for the European Integration Fund, could not be associated with any publication criticising Ministers and their policies, still less with criticism which amounted to accusations of bad faith, nor could it support attacks on other politicians."

For example, in the case of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, 6,000 people, including 2,012 children, in direct provision cannot be handled by the Minister of State, Deputy White, because she will have integration until the individuals concerned have secured citizenship or residency.  In the meantime, she is cutting by half the grant to a publication that would have advocated their rights.  This is an outrageous precedent in censorship for any Government, Minister or Department in the history of the State.

Where is the drugs reference pricing Bill, which could save hundreds of million euro but would hurt the drugs industry?  When will it come before the House?The 4,867 people who are unemployed in Balbriggan have had a very small facility available to them since the original facility was shut in December 2008.

In page 10, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"4.—The Governor of the Central Bank and the Head of Financial Regulation shall present to the Houses of the Oireachtas an appraisal of the Recommendations of the Statutory Commission of Investigation on the Banking system within 3 months of such Commission completing its work.".The Government is in the process of commissioning an investigation into the banking system.  The amendment proposes that the Governor of the Central Bank and head of financial regulation present to the Houses of the Oireachtas the commission's report within three months of it completing its work.  The Fine Gael Party tabled a reasoned amendment on Committee Stage as we opposed the legislation in a number of areas.  One of my party's problems with the Bill was that a proper investigation was not being carried out into the root causes of the banking failure to make key people accountable for errors made.We need to know the appropriate response to dealing with the banking crisis we had.  We had two excellent reports, the Regling and Watson report and the Honohan report, which are leading on to a commission of inquiry.  We feel this legislation should have been done on foot of the commission of investigation into banking being concluded.  There should be an appraisal of that investigation by the Governor of the Central Bank and the head of financial regulation.  Furthermore the ECB issued an opinion on the heads of this legislation on 7 April, calling for the independence of the governor and the commission to be sacrosanct in terms of the Bill.  That was subsequently followed up by a further ECB opinion dated 17 June, stating that these issues, the independence of the Governor of the Central Bank and the commission regarding European System of Central Banks-related tasks had not been catered for in the legislation.This legislation is being rushed through.  It is poor legislation.  We asked for additional time.  This amendment would allow for a proper commission of inquiry following the great work done by Professor Honohan, Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson.  We would then be able to introduce legislation taking into account the ECB opinion of 17 June and the commission of investigation into the banking sector.  That legislation would then address the issues and have relevance.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I support the Fine Gael amendment.  The Minister for Finance promised the Dáil that he would consult the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the commission of inquiry.  We have had a number of meetings with the Minister which have proved fruitless so far because the Minister basically wants to exclude all forms of inquiry into political performance and into the performance of the Department of Finance from the provisions of the inquiry.  Professor Honohan offered an alternative, which I supported and I believe other parties were considering favourably, which was that the Honohan process would recommence as a series of inquiries into each bank and failed institution.We need to bear in mind that in the world records of banking, Anglo Irish Bank's loss of €18.5 billion has emerged as the biggest banking loss in the world last year.  The guarantee was supposed to be the tidiest little guarantee that would cost us nothing and we would have the fastest turnaround.  We were supposed to be the first into recession and the first out.  It was all a load of poppycock.  Professor Honohan sensibly argued for a second stage of his inquiry into each of the banks analysing the role of the Department of Finance and the other agencies in leading the banks to their doom.  If we had that, and as the Fine Gael amendment suggests, a timely report published, we would be in a position to have closure by reporting to this House, being accountable and moving on.  In that context I support the Fine Gael amendment.

In the neighbouring island, the Turner review was completed and presented in March 2009.  We have just had the two reports in recent weeks.  It is critical to have ongoing direct oversight and knowledge of the implementation of recommendations contained in any and all of these reviews.  Deputy O'Donnell's amendment makes eminent sense and clearly indicates to those who have been tasked with these undertakings and those who are responsible for their implementation that the Houses of the Oireachtas intend to continue to maintain a direct interest in and awareness of what is happening.  We need to do that.  It is the critical final guarantor for people to have democratically accountable voices which clearly have been missing from the entire process of regulation and oversight of the financial institutions going back over decades.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The two reports into the banking crisis present an expert analysis and assessment of the issues and findings.  The conclusions of the reports provide the basis for the preparation of the terms of reference for a statutory commission of investigation.  As the Minister for Finance outlined in his recent letter to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, he has invited the views of the committee on the terms of reference of the commission of investigation.  He has asked the committee to respond by 15 September.  I know Deputy Burton made a point about consultation with the Minister.  It is important to note that he has given until that date for that to be concluded.  He has also stated clearly that he is happy to make himself available to the committee to answer any questions it might have and that documents prepared in the crisis management period will be made available to the committee.Given that the terms of reference have not yet been agreed it obviously would be premature to accept the amendment.  However, when the second piece of legislation is introduced in the autumn it would be timely to consider the points made by Deputy O'Donnell and to look further into the issue then.  However, I am not in a position to accept the amendment now.

In page 10, line 43, after "Bank" to insert the following:"save as is deemed necessary to secure the more effective oversight of the financial sector".This amendment relates to staff moving.  The integrity of the effective oversight of the financial sector is paramount.  Section 10(5) states:Other than the holder of a statutory office that ceases to exist because of amendments to the Act of 1942 by this Act, nothing in this Act affects the terms and conditions of the employment of any officer or employee of the Bank.We agree with that provision.  However, the amendment seeks to add the term "save as is deemed necessary to secure the more effective oversight of the financial sector".  It is critical that we strike a balance.  While absolutely respecting the terms and conditions of employment of any employee, it is critical that we have proper and effective oversight of the financial sector.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Notwithstanding Deputy O'Donnell's views, as a former Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, I would be very concerned at the impact of the amendment were it to be accepted.  As Deputies will be aware, section 5 is a standard saver provision to safeguard the terms and conditions of employees under the new unified structure.  To be fair, Deputy O'Donnell has indicated he supports that.  However, the amendment seems to propose a sweeping power to dis-apply the employee protections in section 5 on grounds that are anything but clear to me and which would be open to wide-ranging interpretation were the amendment to come into force.  At a minimum, accepting the amendment would place a doubt over the security of employment, and terms and conditions of those currently working for the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank without consultation with staff interests and without regard to broader considerations of fairness.  In those circumstances I simply could not accept the amendment.

In page 12, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:"(9) Within one year of the enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter, the Agency shall publish an assessment of the performance of the Commission in protecting consumer interests through its regulations, orders, codes of practice and other activities.".With regard to the allocation of functions between the commission and the National Consumer Agency, we think it is extremely important that within one year of this Bill's enactment, and each year thereafter, the agency should "publish an assessment of the performance of the commission in protecting consumer interests through its regulations, orders, codes of practice and other activities".There are two agencies in effect, the commission and the National Consumer Agency, and from an oversight perspective it is critical that we are absolutely certain consumer interests are protected within the commission and the Central Bank.  It is a reasonable amendment seeking to protect the interests of consumers, and any assessment of the performance of the commission by an agency with expertise in the area of consumer interests is to be welcomed.  I look forward to the Minister supporting the amendment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I will speak to the amendment on behalf of the Labour Party.  One of the risks with any change in the Central Bank structure is that while we get over the mistakes made and which led to the crash, on the other side we could create corresponding mistakes because of a lack of balance in the legislation.  The critical change element in the legislation is that the focus has moved almost entirely and understandably to the prudential regulation of banks as institutions.  That means policy in the Central Bank and the new regulator will be geared towards trying to make banks profitable again, which will inevitably come at a cost to the consumer.As I have stated in previous discussions on the Bill, the Department of Finance does not appear to understand that consumers of banking services are not just people like me, individual consumers and families, because in this country they also include small and medium businesses, which are the backbone of employment around the country.  Consumer interests will not be protected and there will be no barrier between companies and the banks with rip-off fees or charges for financial products.  The previous banking model heavily incentivised bank managers and staff to turn into selling agents of bank products on commissions and bonus payments.  There is nothing in this legislation that will in any way temper the banks in future from continuing with this.The Minister is suggesting that legislation in the autumn may change this but the banks will have a field day in upping their charges to whatever level they feel is sustainable in order to get their profits back.  That is the approach of the Department of Finance.  We should remember that we want banks to work but we do not want banks making excessive profits and ripping off consumers, which is why it is very important for serious attention to be paid in the legislation to consumers who are individual customers and small and medium enterprises.This is not a worry for the multinationals in Ireland because, by and large, they are not dependent on local Irish banks in Ireland for their main financing structure.  They may use local bank services or the Irish Financial Services Centre for treasury operations but in the main they are not stuck in the Irish market as are Irish small and medium companies and indigenous companies.  In the Minister's eagerness to correct the mistakes of the past he is sleepwalking into allowing consumers, including businesses, to be completely ripped off without any protection against excessive bank charges.

We prepared and published a report on this and Deputies Bruton, Burton, others and I were very much involved in the exercise.  I can consider the position all these years later as a former employee of one of these banking institutions of 12 years duration.  As a customer today, knowledgeable of the experiences of my community and the wider business environment in particular, I can see the position is worse than it was when we set about the preparation of that report.Despite all the bailout efforts for banking institutions, practices are mushrooming within the banking sector in particular that are geared towards ripping off the Seán and Mary citizen customer.  It is an outrage that they are continuing to get away with it and there is no serious check on these practices that every day further burden already hard-pressed ordinary and decent citizens across the State.It is long past time that a serious engagement should take place and the banking institutions brought to heel.  Such an effort is not contained in this Bill in the way that it should be, although I will not object to its final passage.  There is significant need for a wake-up call on the Government's part as to what is actually happening on the high street with regard to the conduct of the banking institutions vis-à-vis their respective customers.  People have been left in an invidious position as we move more to a cashless society, and people are absolutely trapped in the diktat of these profit-driven entities and those who lie faceless behind them.There is a serious confidence deficit now in the ordinary consumer vis-à-vis the banking institutions.  This proposal, in a small but welcome way, would help to assuage some of those fears as there would at least be an annual review of the extent of the consumer protection model at the heart of the regulatory system now being developed.  Without consumer protection at the core and a central pillar of the approach to new regulation within financial institutions, the current serious lack of confidence on the part of ordinary people will deepen in the time ahead.  I commend the amendment from Deputies O’Donnell and Burton and I hope the Minister might have a more positive response than those given heretofore.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	237	It seems there is a considerable level of agreement in focusing on prudential regulation.  Across all sides of the House there is concern about the protection of consumers.  What is at issue is the best means by which one ought to bring this about in the context of this legislation.It is important to remember that under the Bill responsibility for providing consumers with financial information and education is being transferred to the National Consumer Agency, along with associated staff.  The Government has decided the National Consumer Agency is best fitted to support consumers of financial services and products by providing information and education in line with the agency's overall responsibilities to consumers.  The supervision and regulation of products, markets and institutions from a consumer perspective remains with the bank, and it is common sense and logical for it to operate as such.It would appear to me to be inappropriate to assign to the National Consumer Agency, which is the agency responsible for information and education, the role of reporting on the Central Bank's performance of its statutory functions, functions which are clearly outside the remit of the NCA.The Bill makes separate provision for a consumer advisory group.  Amendments made to the Bill on Committee Stage will further develop the role of this group.  It must be acknowledged that Opposition spokespersons and others had an input in this regard.  Provision is also made for the Central Bank to provide to the Oireachtas an annual statement of its regulatory performance and to discuss that statement before an Oireachtas committee, if requested to do so.  In my view this is the ideal location in which all of this ought to be dealt with in an open and transparent manner.  We are all committed to addressing it in such a way.  In the circumstances, this amendment would be entirely counterproductive and I do not propose to accept it.

In page 13, after line 43, to insert the following:"14.—(1) The Bank shall establish and maintain a consultative panel to be called the Credit Unions Consultative Panel (in this section referred to as "the Panel").(2) As soon as practicable after establishing the Panel, the Bank shall publish in Iris Oifigiúil a notice to the effect that the Panel has been established and the date on which the establishment took effect.(3) The Panel is to consist of not fewer than 5, and not more than 20, members.(4) The members of the Panel are to be appointed by the Minister for Finance after consulting those organisations that, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, represent the interests of—(a) credit unions, and(b) credit union members.(5) In appointing persons as members to the Panel, the Minister shall ensure as far as possible that those persons have knowledge or experience of or as consumers of services provided by credit unions.(6) A person is not eligible to be appointed as a member of the Panel if the person—(a) is a member of either House of the Oireachtas or is, with the person’s consent, nominated as a candidate for election as such a member, or(b) is a member of the European Parliament or is, with the person’s consent, nominated as a candidate for election as such a member or to fill a vacancy in the membership of that Parliament, or(c) is a member of a local authority or is, with the person’s consent, nominated as a candidate for election as such a member.(7) A member of the Panel holds office for such period, not exceeding 5 years, as is specified in the member's document of appointment, unless the member ceases to hold office.(8) A member is eligible for reappointment at the end of a period of office.(9) The Minister shall appoint one of the members of the Panel to be chairperson of the Panel.(10) The functions of the Panel are as follows:(a) to monitor the performance by the Bank of its functions and responsibilities in relation to credit unions;(b) to provide the Bank with comments with respect to the performance of its functions and responsibilities in relation to credit unions;(c) to provide the Bank with comments and suggestions with respect to the performance of credit unions;(d) to provide the Bank with suggestions for initiatives that, in the Panel’s opinion, the Bank should take with respect to the performance of its functions and responsibilities in relation to credit unions;(e) to provide the Bank with comments on the impact that the conditions and restrictions imposed by the Bank on credit unions have on the competitiveness of credit unions;(f) to provide the Bank with comments with respect to changing trends within credit unions that have implications for the functions and responsibilities of the Bank;(g) when the Bank so requests, to comment on a policy document or regulatory document, or a proposed policy document or proposed regulatory document, prepared by the Bank in relation to credit unions.(11) The Bank shall provide the Panel with such administrative services (including technical and legal advice), and such funds, as the Bank believes are necessary to enable the Panel to perform its functions.(12) The Bank shall arrange for an officer or employee of the Bank nominated by it to attend a meeting of the Panel whenever the chairperson of the Panel asks the Bank to do so.(13) Within 3 months after the end of each financial year, or within such extended period as the Bank allows, the Panel shall prepare an annual report that provides details of its activities during that year.(14) The Bank shall arrange for publication of the annual report of the Panel.(15) The Bank shall also arrange for publication of—(a) comments made by the Panel to the Bank in accordance with this section, and(b) any statement of reasons given by the Bank in response to any such comments, and(c) reports of meetings of the Panel, and(d) any other report produced or commissioned by the Panel, and(e) the rules of procedure of the Panel.(16) Before making or issuing a policy document or a regulatory document in relation to or affecting credit unions, the Bank shall consult the Panel, unless the Bank believes that the document must be made or issued without delay. In that case, the Bank shall consult the Panel as soon as possible after the document is made or issued.(17) In making or issuing a policy document or regulatory document in relation to or affecting credit unions, the Bank shall take into account the advice (if any) provided by the Panel on any aspect of the document. If the Bank declines to give effect to any particular advice provided by the Panel, it shall provide the Panel with a written statement setting out its reasons for declining to give effect to the advice and shall, if the Panel so requires, publish the statement.(18) If the Bank makes or issues a policy document or regulatory document, a failure to comply with subsection (15) or (16) in relation to the document does not of itself invalidate the document.(19) The chairperson of the Panel shall attend a meeting of the relevant Joint Committee of the Oireachtas whenever that Committee requires the chairperson to do so.(20) When attending a meeting of the relevant Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, the chairperson of the Panel shall provide that Committee with such information as  it reasonably requires about matters with which the Panel is or has been concerned.(21) In this section, "relevant Joint Committee of the Oireachtas" means a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas to which the Oireachtas has assigned the role of examining matters relating to the operation of the Bank.".These amendments deal directly with credit unions in Ireland and, in an important and significant way, with the future of the credit union movement in this country in terms of how it is to be regulated, assisted and enhanced in its important role in Irish society in respect of industrial credit unions for people at work in various occupations and, in particular, local credit unions which provide a service not alone to people who consciously choose to bank with credit unions but, more important, people and communities that no longer have access to banking services because they do not offer enough profit to the commercial banks.The purpose of amendment No. 10, which I urge the Government to accept, is to put on a statutory footing in this important legislation, which seeks to regulate the financial services sector and to avoid the mistakes made in the past, the credit union movement, not as an add-on in the Schedules to the Bill to be regulated at the behest of the Central Bank, but by way of recognised position within the legal framework of the legislation.  This would allow for the establishment of a credit union panel.  Amendment No. 10 is detailed and sets out what the Labour Party has in mind.The panel will have the power to consult organisations which in the view of the Minister for Finance represent credit unions and, more important, credit union members who at this time have between €11 billion and €13 billion in savings.  People are currently saving more because they are terrified to spend.  The credit union movement is strong in terms of savings.  The Labour Party supports strong regulation of the credit union movement, as does the movement.  It is important that people's savings are fully protected.  We want to see introduced a code of regulation which includes the credit union movement.On the night of the guarantee scheme the bankers were called in.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Mr. Seán FitzPatrick was called up to Farmleigh.  It was not necessary to call in to Farmleigh or the Department of Finance the directors of credit unions because they were not indulging in massive speculation and the ruination of their financial institutions.  Why will Fianna Fáil not in this legislation give due recognition in an orderly and structured way to the credit union movement?  Other countries do this.A consumer panel is a panel made up of people with an interest and expertise in finance, credit unions and credit union members.  This will ensure continuous dialogue between the Central Bank, the Regulator, the credit unions and those who represent and are members of them in terms of obtaining the best possible outcome and regulation of the credit union movement in Ireland, thus allowing it to respond to the challenging conditions of the times and putting it in a position to upgrade, improve and change structures to respond to changing times.  This is what we want.  We also want consultation built in and for the people at the top of the Central Bank and Financial Regulatory Authority to give due recognition to issues other than profit in banking, which as I stated earlier is well considered in this Bill.Part of the function of this Bill is to try to make the banks profitable.  The function of the guarantee scheme was to plug the hole in the banks' balance sheets.  Anglo Irish Bank has so far cost us €22 billion.  What is wrong with Fianna Fáil Members that they cannot get into their head that the interests of the credit union movement should be fully recognised in this legislation?  Amendment No. 10 is a modest, careful and cautious proposal which would allow credit unions to have a statutory function in this Bill.  During discussion on Committee Stage the Minister said that the proposal I put forward on behalf of the Labour Party was a good one.  I note that he has responded by way of amendment No. 34 which seeks to give the bank the power to, if it so wishes, establish an advisory group in respect of credit unions.  It is at the disposal of the Governor of the Central Bank to establish such an advisory group which will have no statutory function.  We are proposing that we, once and for all, in reshaping financial review and regulation structures in Ireland, recognise the credit union movement.We are all aware of the reports made to committees in regard to the bad debts or bad debt potential of approximately five credit unions, which we understand to be for the most part small local area credit unions.  Amendment No. 55, a Labour Party amendment, provides specifically that the Central Bank will be in a position to facilitate the voluntary merger of credit unions in the State in the interests of improve financial stability and management of the credit union sector.   The amendment provides for a resolution mechanism which would assist the Financial Regulator in dealing with, as stated by him in committee, the one or two credit unions about which he is concerned.  Our amendment is a sensible response to the concerns that were expressed.  The State should facilitate small area credit unions that may wish to merge.  This legislation should allow that to happen.  If the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator deem it appropriate, it should be facilitated in a positive way.  Deputies from all parties, including Fianna Fáil, are familiar with the problems encountered by people in many communities, including my constituency, in the run up to Christmas.  They have to go to credit unions, to registered money lenders, who charge huge rates of interest, or to informal money lenders, who charge mega interest rates.  The Central Bank is not above considering the need for social banking.  As this form of business is worth between €11 billion and €13 billion, it should not be dismissed out of hand.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Killeen, can respond positively on behalf of Fianna Fáil to the Labour Party's moderate and modest amendments, which would uphold and strengthen this country's credit union movement and enable it to grow.  We should not allow the credit union sector to be wiped out, which is the aspiration of certain commercial banks.  They would like an additional €11 billion or €13 billion to be lodged into their accounts, and let the credit unions go on the hunt.

It is very worthwhile.  In the short time available to me, I would like to refer specifically to amendment No. 53.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Killeen, for allowing some additional amendments to be discussed as part of this group.  The amendments before the House go to the heart of the issue with the credit union movement.  The Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service have had lengthy debates with the various bodies in the credit union sector.  I understand the credit union movement, having met the Minister on a number of occasions, has reached a general consensus on the amendment to be made to section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  However, we are going into the unknown with the introduction of the new section 35A, which will give the regulator wide-ranging powers with regard to credit unions, ineffect.A number of factors need to be emphasised in this regard.  We all want sound and strong regulation of the credit union movement.  That is also the aim of the movement itself.  We want to protect the interests of deposit holders.  We need to ensure we do not throw out the baby with the bath water, however.  The taxpayer has bailed out the large banks.  The €22 billion that has been put into Anglo Irish Bank has gone down the toilet.  Money has been also put into the other banks.  I do not know of a red cent that has been put into the credit union movement.  There is a concern that the credit unions' deposit base will be ravaged by the banks. The credit union movement is based on lending the money the credit unions have on deposit.  They do not go to the wholesale markets to borrow the money they lend.  The banks that have taken such risks have wasted the hard-earned money of taxpayers.The community-based credit union movement works by taking deposits as part of a saving culture, lending that money back into the community and making interest from the money it lends in order to pay a dividend.  If credit unions cannot pay a dividend, they will not attract deposits.  In such circumstances, the deposits will go instead to the banks, which are keen to raid the credit unions in any event, and the credit union movement will not be able to provide vital services to small people throughout this country.  As a chartered accountant who worked as a sole practitioner for many years, I assure the House that many of my clients would have gone out of business in the 1990s if it had not been for the credit union movement.  They could not get overdraft facilities from the banks.  On Monday mornings, they used to go to their local credit union to get a bank draft before continuing to their local bank to lodge the draft and thereby stay in business.  We owe the credit union movement something, but we owe the banks nothing.Last night, I asked the Minister, Deputy Killeen, whether the Minister for Finance met the credit union movement before amendment No. 53 was tabled on Report Stage.  I have not yet received an answer.  I want to hear an answer.  The credit union movement has worked with the Minister.  We have had various meetings with the Minister.  I have drawn up an amendment on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, but it does not appear to be on the list of Report Stage amendments.  I will ensure it is tabled in the Seanad.  The amendment will provide that the new section proposed in amendment No. 53, which combines sections 35 and 35A, "shall not come into effect" until an order for its commencement is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and an assessment of its impact on the credit union movement is undertaken and published.

That is why we have proposed that an impact assessment should be carried out.  We wanted a review to take place as part of the Government commission of inquiry before this legislation was introduced.  As late as a week ago, the European Central Bank expressed its opinion that the independence of the Governor of the Central Bank and the commission is not being taken care of in this Bill.  This legislation is being rushed.  The credit union movement is entitled to a fair hearing, but it has not got it.  The Minister for Finance has given it the run-around.  That is not good enough.There are credit unions in every parish, village, city and community in the country.  Along with the GAA and the rugby and soccer organisations, the credit union movement represents the heart and soul of Ireland.  The credit union is the small person's bank.  The Government is about to guillotine the legislation it is foisting on the credit union movement.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Killeen, is allowing us to discuss amendment No. 53 with this group of amendments.  I thank him for that.  This measure will put the cart before the horse.  There needs to be a proper impact study on the effect this regulation will have on the credit union sector, which we want to be sound.  The great majority of credit unions are in a sound financial position.  The many credit unions in the Minister of State's constituency of Clare are doing phenomenal work.  I am familiar with the work that credit unions do for people in Limerick city and the surrounding rural areas.  I hope the Minister for Finance will give us some comfort by accepting the amendment we will propose in the Seanad and thereby ensure the credit union movement is viable, strong and regulated in a way that does not choke it to death.  If it is not able to survive, the banks we are currently bailing out will benefit.  That would not be good enough.

As providers of financial services to communities, they are distinct and, in particular, socially focused.  I hate to think what situation countless thousands of citizens and businesses would be in if they were unable to avail of the credit union network and disposition we currently enjoy.  While the current situation is bad, it would be infinitely worse without the credit unions.  I do not doubt that in such circumstances, the dole queues, the number of people on the emigrant boats and the extent of the poverty that is evident up and down the length and breadth of this State would be multiplied. Their role has been phenomenal and deserves to be acknowledged and given full credit.It is important that the measures being introduced to — fix is hardly the right word — address and substantially improve the regulation of the banking sector do not adversely impact on the operations and success of the credit union movement.  That would be an unacceptable outworking or by-product of what is contained in this legislation.Sinn Féin agree wholeheartedly with amendment No. 10, as presented by Deputy Burton, which provides for the establishment of a credit unions consultative panel to represent and safeguard the interests of credit unions and, very importantly, the interests of the members of credit unions, because credit unions are all about their memberships.One of the concerns validly expressed by the credit union movement is that the current consultative process in the sector is not adequate.  It has been said to me and, I am sure, to other Deputies, that the advisory panels should be confined to the specific areas of review and not broadened out across the industry as a whole, as has so often happened.  For example, the current practice of representatives of banks commenting, at panel level, on regulatory issues relating to credit unions is wholly inappropriate and should be brought to a stop.  It is not the banks' business.  If they minded their own business it would suit them better.  That is one of the critical areas that needs to be kept in the back of our minds as we consider this matter.The credit unions have played a phenomenal and unsung role, particularly in the past two or three years but also for decades before.  In the past number of years they have helped families and small businesses to survive through this outrageously difficult financial situation, which was not brought about by any of those people or contributed to by the credit union movement throughout the country.  It is a national movement.I strongly support amendment No. 10 and I join with the earlier voices in urging the Minister and the Government to accept it in its entirety.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I support the amendments.  The record of credit unions is superb.  The situation in the movement is so different from what happened in other areas.  Banks failed, the regulators failed but credit unions have not failed.  We know there have been problems in some credit unions.  In my own local credit union in Monaghan town there was a problem but the credit union officers dealt with it.  When they found there was a difficulty they got in and, thankfully, have restored confidence in the credit union.  I remember the day I left this House in a panic and hurried to Monaghan to check out the situation but I found that everything was covered and above board.  No one lost a cent.The record of the credit union structure and how it works is extraordinary.  If the Minister proceeds with some of the proposed regulations he will make it impossible for those structures to continue to work.  Many people would be out of business were it not for the credit unions.  Many small companies had to go to credit unions, not only this year but in many previous years, to ensure they could continue in business.  Banks simply refused them.  These are the banks that this House supported.  We gave €22.5 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and that money has, without question, gone down the tube.The Bill contains credit union regulations that are totally unjustifiable and unworkable.  For example, if two members of a family have jobs but one of them loses his or her job, it might make sense for them to extend the term of their loan.  Even if they never missed a payment in their lives, that loan will be classified, under this legislation, as being impaired.  They will be unable to get further credit for any other reason and they may be forced to resort to money lenders.  What does this House allow money lenders to do?  We allow them to charge up to 188% interest.  What does that do for any individual who is in some slight trouble?It is important to have regulation.  I am not against it.  However, it must be sensible and realistic.  I hope the Minister will reconsider these amendments.  As far back as December 2009, the Minister for Finance agreed to review credit unions and promised that nothing would be done until the review was completed.  What has happened to that commitment?  We want to make sure that credit unions are sustainable, and not money lenders.  The availability of credit is vital.I know from my clinics, as I am sure the Minister also knows, that little or no money is being given out by the main banks.  If it is it is under terms that people cannot accept because to do so would put their families at risk.  Credit unions allow companies to survive.  I beg the Minister to ensure that sensible regulations are introduced and those that are nonsensical are withdrawn for the time being.  Let us allow time for proper structures to be put in place.

Does the Minister for Defence fully endorse, in his heart, the recommendations made in the Bill?I come from a rural county in the west where the credit union network is the most extensive of all and where the banks now have very little interest in helping small business and ordinary people who work hard.  This effort to strangle the credit unions and to deny them the freedom they have had is most unfortunate.  An initiative was recently created by the credit unions and advertised in the public press.  They proposed, in the absence of the banks, to help small businesses and give them access to funding.   The funding was restricted yet it was not made available by the banks.  The banks, through the regulator and the registrar of the credit union movement, told credit unions, individually, they could not embark on that type of lending because the banks claimed they were making credit available.  They are not.  Instead, they make proposals and give approvals but these approvals fall far short of the requirements of small businesses.The Minister of State is propping up the banks and giving them greater leverage to kill off credit unions.  Essentially, the Minister of State is driving people who urgently need small loans into the hands of moneylenders.  That is the reality.  Do we want that situation to develop once again?  We thought we had eradicated it.  Through the credit union network in the country many people have structured their financial requirements in times of need but now there is a return to a situation where moneylenders will be knocking on doors once more.  I did not believe the Minister of State would take up the initiative to lead us in that direction.

The credit union movement is an integral part of community life in Ireland, particularly in my constituency, County Clare.  I am sure my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has met deputations from County Clare credit unions in his constituency office.  Since Friday, when this latest bombshell was dropped, they have been in touch with me.The credit union movement has been conned on this matter by Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Finance.  They were duped and told, "We're going to sort this out.  Don't kick up a racket — we'll look after the credit union movement".  They have not done so and this Bill is where it counts.  I appeal to the Minister of State to look favourably on the credit union movement, the wonderful work it does and the flexibility it can offer its members.  When people encounter difficulties loans can be rescheduled.  The country is now in a very difficult situation.  People are under huge financial stress and the flexibility the credit union movement can offer its members was never more needed.The new proposals would bring about considerable oversight of credit unions in terms of regulation.  The credit union movement is not broken so there is no need to fix it or tamper with it.   I strongly support this amendment.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I will not go over old ground but it is important to put on the record that this amendment makes sense.  As a rural Deputy and as a Member of the Cabinet, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has an obligation to take this issue seriously at a time when there is international as well as national debate about how the banking sector should go forward.  Obviously, the unregulated international banking sector is not the way forward and as we cannot go back to the socialist-type models we must look at something in between.  We have an in-between, a fundamentally democratic institution in the shape of the credit union, made up of local people in their local parishes, holding regular annual general meetings — factors fundamental to creating a  mix between capitalism and socialism.The Minister may smile.  There are experts in studios, whether at the BBC, CNN, UTV or RTE, sitting around tables saying we need a mix between socialism and capitalism.  The mix is there, right in front of the Minister's nose — the credit union model.  I cite my local parish which has had a turnover of €30 million since 1992, with 3,000 members.  This is staring at us straight in the face.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments because it makes sense to do so.  I ask him not to make an umbrella regulation for all these individual, independent and different local institutions.  A credit union institution in one part of County Donegal is different from one in another part of the county, never mind from others in County Cork or in the Minister's constituency of County Clare.  They are unique and fundamentally democratic and they are the solution for forward looking banking sector reform.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I support these amendments, particularly Nos. 10 and 55, which are in the name of my colleague, Deputy Burton.  The danger is that because of the catastrophe which has befallen us due to blind-eye regulation we will now swing 180 degrees the other way.  The amendments introduced by the Minister, Nos. 35a and b, were an afterthought.  Somebody said, “We are restructuring regulation dealing with reform in the Central Bank and the regulator — my God, this is our chance to include the credit unions”.  Notwithstanding that a strategic review of credit unions is under way the opportunity was taken to include the credit unions in this fashion. The danger is that unless this is very carefully calibrated it could undermine the very ethos of the credit union movement.  If one takes for example the matter of the provisions that might be imposed in respect of additional provisioning, that could obviate the payment of dividends at the year end, an essential part of what the credit union movement is about.  One might consider the terms used in the Bill about a "class" of credit unions and the capacity of the regulator to intervene in terms of a class of credit unions.  As I understand it, a class of credit unions refers to any common characteristic that might exist.  For example, a particular job-based credit union might have got into difficulty because it was over-generous in lending to people who otherwise might have been caught up in property speculation or something of the kind.  Instead they went to their credit unions to raise moneys, not overtly for property and, as a result, the union ran into difficulty.  The entire class of credit union, as I understand it, would be affected by the intervention of the regulator.  These issues were not discussed with the people who know most about them.  There is a real danger that the very ethos of the credit union movement will be undermined.Deputy Burton's amendment No. 10 has, at least, the great merit of providing expertise from the people who know most to advise the bank about how it should proceed.  It is a reasoned amendment that sets out in considerable detail what might be done.  Regarding amendment No. 55, it was said to me that the Credit Union Act I introduced in 1997 makes provision for mergers and so on.  Again, that can be an immensely sensitive issue.  One might consider small — in the geographic sense — credit unions where in modern conditions some mergers or synergies may be apparent.  Deputy Burton's amendment proposes an improvement in terms of how it would facilitate the voluntary merger of credit unions.We are constrained for time and that is a shame, given the significance of this Bill and given the disaster that has befallen the country.  This is worse than the Famine in some ways, yet the Government is rushing the Bill through the House and is giving entirely inadequate time to deal with it.  I ask the Minister to take on board the amendments being proffered here, because the credit union movement is something precious and we need to calibrate carefully any changes to the regulatory environment.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	258	It is clear from the contact that all of us have had from people representing credit unions over the past few weeks that they are not happy with the amendment proposed by the Minister.  It will impose a whole new system of control on credit unions in what they feel is a completely unreasonable way.  It will prevent credit unions allowing members to restructure their loans in a reasonable way.  They are concerned that because of this imposition, they will not be able to operate on an individual basis to resolve individual problems.  This is the kernel of the problem.  The representatives of the credit unions feel that the long-term micromanagement of credit unions by the regulator or the registrar for credit unions under section 35A and section 35B, which are now present under the new section 2C , will certainly change the way credit unions are operating in this country.Of the 2.5 million credit union members in this country, the average loan is less than €9,000, so we are looking at institutions that are very different from banks here.  I appeal to the Minister, as a pragmatist, to accept the Labour Party and Fine Gael amendments in order to resolve the problem for credit unions and to allay their concerns about this Bill.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	259	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I want to thank you for allowing the inclusion of all seven amendments that relate to the credit unions and I acknowledge the agreement of my colleagues on that.  I am glad that everybody who wanted to make a contribution on this particular matter has had the opportunity to do so.It is important to respond to one of the questions raised by Deputy O'Donnell about the meetings between the Minister for Finance with the credit union representative bodies.  I understand that he engaged in detailed discussions with them on section 35 at two separate meetings in May and June.  The Minister also met members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs.  Having reflected on the views expressed, the Minister is introducing eight measures that will significantly amend the section 35 proposals.The measures include the obligation on the Central Bank to establish an advisory group on credit unions, which is the subject of amendment No. 34, and there are seven other measures.  The proposed sections 35A and 35B in the Bill are deleted.  The easing of section 35 lending limits is now directly linked with the necessary balancing provisions in a cohesive framework within section 35.  A specific statement is introduced in section 35(2)(c), meaning that the Central Bank may give notice to credit unions about lending requirements only where it considers it necessary for the adequate protection of members’ savings.  A further new provision means that in applying requirements in respect of lending by credit unions, the Central Bank must have regard to the lending framework provided for in section 35.Wider powers, originally intended for the Central Bank, in respect of loans and classes of loans under section 35A(1) have been dropped.  Wider powers to enable the Central Bank to impose requirements other than by making rules under section 35A(3) have also been dropped.  The systems controls and reporting requirements, originally provided for in section 35A(1)(f) are now specifically tied into the lending requirements in the section.Taken together, the measures represent a significant package of changes that will establish a lending framework through which the registrar of credit unions can give notice of requirements arising under the relaxation of lending limits provided for in section 35 in a prudent, balanced and proportionate manner, but no more than that.  Reasonable conditions and generous transitional arrangements will also apply.Amendments Nos. 53 and 54 go a considerable way towards meeting the reasonable concerns of credit unions.  At the same time, there is an irreducible minimum level of protection which depositors, credit union members and the general public are entitled to expect.  Overall, the measures being brought here provide for this level of protection.In regard to amendment No. 55, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, Part 9 of the Credit Union Act 1997 deals with the amalgamations and transfers of engagements.  Deputy Rabbitte made a fair point about the manner in which that ought to be considered.  It is adequately dealt with in the legislation of that time, even if he is inclined to feel that it might be usefully amended at this stage.  Section 128 also provides that any two or more credit unions may amalgamate by forming a credit union as their successor.  Each is required to agree with the rules of the new credit union and approval is necessary from the Central Bank.There is agreement on all sides of the House that the credit union movement plays a very important——

I did not interrupt any of the speakers from the other side and everybody who wished to make a contribution was able to do so, which is the way we ought to do business.It seems that Deputy Burton's amendment seeks to provide for the establishment of a credit union consultative panel and she sets out in considerable detail the structure, form and arrangements involved.  Even though I disagree quite strongly with elements of it, I commend her for the amount of work that went into it.  On issues such as this, people in this House often make off the cuff remarks that are entirely ill-considered and do not address the specific element of the Bill under consideration.  I want to acknowledge that Deputy Burton's amendment does that, notwithstanding the fact that I disagree with elements of it.The Deputy's amendment seeks to impose on the bank a legal obligation to consult the proposed panel before making or issuing a policy document or a regulatory document, except in urgent circumstances.My concern is that the amendment seeks to reverse the clear intention in the legislation to dissolve the two existing consultative panels.  That is key to the difficulty I have with amendment No. 10.  It is important to bear in mind that dissolving the panels will establish unequivocally the separation of the bank's governance and accountability structures and the organisation and operational independence of the bank from the regulated providers of financial services.While I agree with the points made by many Members on, as Deputy Ó Caoláin said, the social aspect of the services provided by the credit union movement, in circumstances where this legislation seeks to address the enormous difficulties outlined by several speakers last night, today and on Second and Committee Stages, it would be folly to undermine the central tenet of what it is setting about, which is to dismantle the existing panels and their effect.Deputy Burton's amendment would seem to compromise the bank's integrity by making the regulatory functions of the bank in respect of credit unions subservient and accountable to a panel representing the interests of the regulated entities.  In many respects, the Regling and Watson report and Professor Honohan's report point to the difficulties that arose in the banking sector when this exact provision was in place.  The Deputy's amendment flies in the face of the conclusions of those reports.  I know that Deputy Burton would draw a very clear distinction between the role, size and make-up of the credit unions and the other elements of the banking sector but in this legislation it is important we address the entirety of what has caused the difficulty.

In amendment No. 120 in page 30 of the list, in the fifth line from the bottom, it should read “Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963”.  The word “Act” is currently missing.  In the same amendment on page 38, in the seventh line from the bottom, the first few words should read “quarry under Part 3 of this Act”.  The word “this” currently appears in the wrong place.  The typographical errors will be corrected in the next print of the Bill.

In page 6, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:"3.—The Minister shall, within 3 months of this Act being passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, report to the Dáil on the outcome of any cases involving Ireland in the European Court of Justice rulings, any EU Directives or any other matter which affects Irish planning law.".Following recent decisions of the European court, which struck down various matters related to compliance with European law, this amendment would ensure that we are alerted to these matters at an earlier stage of proceedings so that when action is to be taken, we do not delay as long as we have on this occasion.  Within three months of the Act being passed, there should be a report to a committee of the House or to the Dáil on the outcome of European Court of Justice rules, the implications for the implementation of EU directives, and the implications for Irish law.  I hope it is not controversial to suggest we should have information sent to the Houses of the Oireachtas in line with the Lisbon treaty and provisions for the role of national parliaments in the implementation of EU directives and European Court of Justice rulings, and that we have a timescale of three months for that.

Such an amendment, however, is not suitable for primary legislation.  Deputies interested in the outcome of such cases, or any EU directives affecting Irish planning legislation, may use the parliamentary privilege or may correspond directly with the Minister through the representation system, which was a device I certainly used when sitting on the other side of the House.  The proposed amendment is not acceptable.

People in the Houses of the Oireachtas are often very busy and certain matters may not come to their attention.  When they are brought to their attention they can have them investigated through parliamentary questions or through a mechanism such as the Minister of State suggested.I seek to give certainty to the information flow, so that the Minister shall within three months of the Act being passed report to the Dáil.  I am putting the onus on the State and the responsible Minister to tell the House, rather than the House having to find out in another way.  The House may never find out information that may be important to deliberations or on a subject matter in which it has an interest.  The amendment seeks to give certainty to the fact that the Minister is ultimately responsible for reporting to the House in an accountable parliamentary way.

In page 6, line 8, to delete "or where appropriate" and substitute "or, where appropriate,".These are technical drafting amendments.  Amendment No. 2 is a technical amendment, amendment No. 25 is consequential and proposes to substitute "the case of a plan" for "the case of a development plan or variation of a development plan" in order to be consistent with the same reference in section 31.

In page 8, to delete lines 38 to 40.I will ask the Minister of State to comment on this as perhaps he will agree to it.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Amendment No. 3 proposes the deletion of the definition of the "core strategy" and all references thereafter.  However, the evidence-based core strategy is a cornerstone of the Bill as it ensures a sound development plan, which is the key to ensuring good planning at local level, and it is a central plank to zoning reform.  Decisions taken at the development plan stage affect all other planning decisions.  Therefore, the further amendment is not accepted.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I am disappointed the Minister of State has found it difficult to understand my difficulties with the core strategy that will compel plans for every region.  That is at the heart of the Bill.  Every region, county, city, town and village will be compelled to demonstrate it conforms with targets set by the national spatial strategy.  We know the national spatial strategy process is flawed.  It has no democratic legitimacy as it was never discussed in the House.  The Minister of State speaks about refreshing the national spatial strategy when in fact it is being reviewed.What the Minister of State is doing is illegal; a strategic assessment of this legislation, which is required under European law, was not carried out.  The targets the Minister of State is seeking to implement, from the top down through the core strategy to all local area plans and development plans, are being set by unelected unaccountable people without reference to the economic, environmental or demographic reality.  This is a lot of power to give a Minister of a Department.  It removes the local say and the accountable and democratic opportunity people have had at local level.  Notwithstanding that guidelines must be adhered to I believe the national spatial strategy in its current format has failed.  I do not see any conformity in Government policy to the national spatial strategy introduced in 2002; we know this from decentralisation and other policies implemented at the time.The environmental reality of the effects of the implementation of a national spatial strategy are unknown.  Therefore, we need to have an assessment carried out.  After eight years of the implementation of the flawed national spatial strategy, what is its outcome?  What implications has it had?  What has it done for the country?  What are the implications for the regional planning guidelines?  Basing our entire planning system on a national spatial strategy based on environmental imponderables is not just illegal but wrong.I have a fundamental issue about the definition of "core strategy" as outlined in the Bill and I will oppose it for that reason.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I have a similar problem to Deputy Hogan.  In amendment No. 12, I propose that section 8 be deleted.  I have a particular problem with the subsection which states that submissions to a council shall not refer to a submission relating to requests or proposals for the zoning of particular land for any purpose.  The section also states that a manager is restricted to providing a report on submissions providing they do not relate to the issue of zoning and the development plan.  The Minister has justified this provision by arguing that at this stage submissions should be of a strategic nature and should relate to overall strategy.I have a problem with this because I do not see a straightforward separation between strategy and proposals on rezonings.  A member of the public might want to make a submission that no land should be rezoned in a development plan.  He or she might argue that enough land is zoned under a development plan to last a number of years.  Such a submission might relate to zoning.  Someone might propose that a particular area of land should be a green belt because there should be a particular number of green belts in a county.  Another person might suggest an area should be classed as high amenity or residential in keeping with the consolidation of residential development.From what I can see the Minister of State is ruling out such submissions.  He is making a judgment on what type of submissions members of the public might make if they were to make submissions regarding zonings and he is wrong to do so.  Either one believes in public participation and consultation or one does not.  The Minister of State should open submissions to allow for whatever the public wants to say about a review of a development plan.  I do not agree with the separation between the strategy and zoning.The fundamental part of a development plan, in terms of democratic input, concerns whether one keeps, changes or subtlety adjusts zoning.  By excluding submissions on zonings at this stage lobbying for zonings could be put into a less transparent and publicly accountable channel.  We all know that developers speak to planners, council officials, councillors and so on.  It is the nature of the process.  If that type of thing goes on it should be open and transparent.  These people should put their views on the table.Similarly, members of the public have a view on zoning.  They might have no ownership of or vested interest in the land throughout a county but they may have a view on whether land should be zoned for industrial use to provide jobs in an area and to attract employment.  That is an issue which is strategic in nature and does not just concern zoning.  LAMA has objected to this provision.  It believes that no restrictions should be placed on members of the public in making submissions in the preparation of the draft development plan.  It said it believes the proposals contained in the Bill are undemocratic in seeking to restrict the type of submissions which can be made regarding the development plan.The most important thing for the public is zoning.  That is what development plans are all about, not vague aspirations and what we would like the county to be.  The fundamental element of the development plan is zoning decisions.  The public should be allowed at all stages to say what they think.  Managers should have to read it and provide a report on all the submissions they receive.  A manager can, behind closed doors, make judgments on submissions and decide to exclude some and not others.  There could be a thin line on why he or she made a particular decisions or he or she could be prejudiced.  He or she will not even have to provide a report as to why he or she excluded particular submissions.It is not open and transparent.  It is an undermining of democracy because councillors will never get to see some the submissions people made.  The public will not get to have their say in the way it normally does.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the wording of this section and that it why I propose it be deleted.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	292	On what Deputy Hogan said on the national spatial strategy, while I do not agree with the amendment the Minister should take on board the issue of whether it needs to be reviewed.  It has been in place for a considerable length of time.  The anecdotal evidence suggests that the problem was not with the strategy but that it was not being implemented properly because of inappropriate decisions made at local authority level over the years.  If the strategy was adhered to properly then we might not have the problems we have today.  I agree with the call for a review, but not in the amended way Deputy Hogan suggested.I am sympathetic towards the views expressed by Deputy Tuffy and acknowledge the point she is making in terms of the public being able to have an input.  Local experience of the consultation processes which have taken place with councils so far, be they development plans, draft development plans, part 8 plans or strategic development zones shows that there tends to be a great arrogance in the way the system — I do not refer to individuals because they are all hardworking people — allows officials to disregard that which they do not see as in line with their way of thinking.The Bill will not make that any worse because directly elected councillors can be, have been and always will be contacted directly by members of the public.  We need to inform members of the public of their rights regarding legislation on the zoning of land, which is what is at stake.  A member of the public is not prescribed from making a submission under the terms of this Bill.  He or she can call for something not to be zoned or to be zoned in a perfect way.  It may be disregarded by the officials.  In many cases it is already disregarded by them and will not make much of a difference.The elected members of local authorities are the ones that have the power to change the zoning if they so wish.  We have seen many situations where land has, at the last minute, been turned into residential land.  Deputy Tuffy shares a constituency with me.  The Adamstown site was rezoned as residential within a very short period of time by the then councillors without any consultation with members of the public.  The danger is not in the prescription of the legislation but, rather, the manner in which the officials and elected representatives used the powers given to them.In terms of the new directly elected Dublin mayor, it is also the case that the unelected officials in Dublin will now be overseen, from a strategic viewpoint, by someone who will be directly answerable.  It is the intention of this Government and the Green Party that other directly elected mayors and regional assemblies would be appointed in due course, all of which will be available to Opposition Deputies and members of the public when the draft White Paper on local government is produced.  I urge the Minister of State not to go too far in changing what is in place because it is more about the functions of the officials and councillors rather than what is written down on paper.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The Green Party is not the first to do this.  The previous Government, to be fair, passed the Planning and Development Act 2000 which introduced important initiatives, such as that on strategic development zones.  Fianna Fáil has the second highest number of councillors in local democracy, yet it seems to be sleepwalking into an undermining of it because it seems to be cowed by the Green Party.  Its tail is down between its legs and the Green Party tail is wagging the dog regarding planning and wildlife legislation.This Bill, for all its good elements, contains provisions which are subtlety undermining democracy.  The Green Party says it wants more public participation and is in favour of the Aarhus convention but in this Bill it does not trust the public and is trying to restrict what it can do regarding making submissions.  It wants to stop what it sees as the bad public from making submissions and keep what it considers is good from the public.  It is making a judgment about the type of submissions people might make.  It is also in favour of local democracy and has a local government White Paper.Yet, in this Bill the Green Party is subtlety undermining democracy.  Deputy Gogarty gave an example where something was introduced in a development plan.  When the public kicks up about zonings very often they are dropped.  If one allows the public to take an interest in zonings it can in turn influence their elected representatives on the council.  Many bad zoning decisions have been dropped.  We have to allow democracy to work.If bad decisions are made there are other ways of dealing with it, rather than undermining local democracy.  In this Bill the Government is handing over the power to a county manager.  It is presuming the county manager will always be right and that councillors and the public cannot be trusted.

I am concerned about such a charge being made in the House and do not know whether I am protected under Standing Orders.This Bill is about reform and greater regulatory oversight of the planning system.  Everyone in this Chamber would agree that the planning system failed us dramatically in regard to oversight and over development.  This is the reason for NAMA and ghost estates.  We need to ask what went wrong and how we can avoid such dramatically bad planning in the future.  That is one of the fundamental reasons for this Bill.All future zoning decisions will be required to be plan led and evidence based and should assist in working towards the national interest and efficient use of taxpayer investment in infrastructure.  It is a simple choice between a developer-led planning system or a plan-based one.  Either we take a laissez faire approach in which developers call the shots, which happened on far too many occasions in the past, or we co-ordinate our policies and ensure the views of the public matter.  This Bill takes the latter approach.

We are providing that the strategic issues shall be addressed at an early stage of the development process.  It is not about Mary Mac's 1.5 acres on the edge of the town.  It is about the future of the town.  I do not want planners to face piles of papers dealing with rezoning decisions in the early stages when they should be deciding where the jobs, sewers, roads, schools and health clinics should go.  I want these strategic issues to be addressed at an early stage of the planning process rather than having the local authority be swamped with detailed submissions on rezoning from the get-go.

His Department is seeking to take unto itself the power to approve all local area development plans, regional authority guidelines and national policy.  The Department does not issue many circulars on job creation or rural enterprise but we hear a lot about settlement targets.  The Minister of State now intends to prescribe how many people will live in our towns of village.

This is grossly illegal.The Bill seeks to enforce settlement targets under this core strategy.  It treats personal decisions about where people want to live, work and rear their families as if they are boxes on a shelf that can be rearranged at the whim of the Department.  I think that is wrong because we live in a democracy.  It flies in the face of the devolution of powers to local government and everything the Green Party and Fianna Fáil have argued in terms of giving more power to locally elected representatives to order their areas' affairs, subject to the NSS.  The provisions of the Bill requires this core strategy to demonstrate compliance with a national spatial strategy that has been democratically unaccountable, demonstrably wrong and, in my view, totally illegal.  For this reason, I will be pressing the amendment.

We cannot allow little cabals to make their own rules in their respective areas.  This is why we have basic laws for human, civil and animal rights.  Planning is no different.  We must have a basic level of good planning and we cannot allow a mullah mentality to interfere just because a couple of people are in cahoots with a landowner or developer.  This is why I believe it is essential that the Minister gets these powers.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Unfortunately, I have forgotten what I want to say.  I was waiting too long.  In regard to the Minister of State's comment that one cannot make a submission about zoning when the strategy is being considered, I do not accept that zoning and strategic considerations are separate in the way he claims.  He referred to jobs as a strategic issue but the question of zoning land for industrial use is relevant in this regard.  Similarly, schools are built to cater for residential communities, which need to be zoned.  Green belts form part of both the strategy and the zoning aspects of a plan.  He is wrong, therefore, to assert that zoning should not be included in submissions made under section 8.

Consequently, the NSS does not fall within the time remit of the directive.  The Deputy is, therefore, incorrect to state that what I am doing is illegal.  Our proposals in the Bill are, in fact, entirely legal and progressive.He used the word "dictation" but the Bill does the opposite by allowing local people to make local decisions.  I believe it will result in less intervention from central government because it will allow more robust and sustainable decisions to be made at a local level.  To give an example, I had a meeting earlier with a group concerned about the western rail link.  In light of the reinstatement of the rail link between Limerick and Galway, it is seeking a further extension of the western rail corridor, on which there has been a fantastic grassroots campaign for many years.  We discussed the connection between land use and transportation as well as the need for local authorities to prioritise where they want development to take place to maximise the significant Government investment in the railways in the coming years.  It is not of any use if there is no connection between decisions on transport, education, health and where people are and will be in future.  For this reason, it is important to refresh the national spatial strategy and establish a connection between regional planning guidelines drawn up by democratically elected councillors and local authorities.  Coherence is needed from the national stage all the way down to the community hall and this is what the Bill achieves.  It will also save money for the taxpayer and result in better decision making.

It is something that has happened for many years in rural areas.  Since time began people were allowed to cut their own turf for domestic use.  It is part of our heritage and culture.  It is a shame that the Minister would see fit to remove this right from people in rural areas.  I understand approximately 34 bogs were closed down after the Minister introduced a directive earlier this year.  I understand a further 130 bogs will come under the directive next year.  This is grossly wrong and I would like the Minister of State to comment on it.  There is also his proposal on once-off housing.

I know people in rural areas who cannot access their land and property.  Many farmers went into afforestation over the past number of years but now cannot get into those routes to thin plantations.  There is an urgent need to consider the area and provide sufficient funding for those involved in afforestation.  I hope the Minister will take note of this when going to Cabinet in order to fight for those people and additional funding to repair and carry out the necessary maintenance on those routes.

I spoke on this on Committee Stage and mentioned that Ms Karin Dubsky of Coastwatch Ireland raised the issue with us.  I may have asked if the Government was in discussion with Coastwatch Ireland to deal with the issues she raised and which we raised through our amendment.  Will the Minister of State clarify the matter as the Government's amendment seems to address the concerns in my amendment?  Is Coastwatch Ireland happy with that?

We have considered the matter again and spoken to colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 11, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:"7.—Section 9 of the Principal Act is amended—(a) in subsection (4) by the deletion of “have regard to” and the substitution therefor of “take into account”, and(b) in subsection (5) by the deletion of “substantial” and the substitution therefor of “material”.”.We are dealing with section 9 of the principal Act and how it refers to "have regard to" in one subsection and in another section it has the term "substantial".  With "have regard to" we propose to substitute "take into account" and with "substantial" we propose to substitute "material".  I am moving the amendment on foot of representations made by one of the Minister of State's former colleagues, the former Deputy Roger Garland.  He brought to my attention a court case, McEvoy v. Meath County Council, where the wording “shall have regard to” was considered.He advises me that the High Court spent approximately two weeks deciding what the phrase meant and in finding for the defendant it stated the council, having considered the guidelines, was entitled to ignore most suggestions.  Effectively, the phrase as it stands has very little meaning.I am not hung up on our amendment but it does raise the issue.  The original section 9 in the principal Act uses different phrases in different subsections.  In section 9 of the 2000 principal Act phrases used include "shall have regard to" in subsection (4), "shall take into account" in subsection (5) and "shall, in so far as is practicable, be consistent with" in subsection (6).  It is a valid issue as to how much weight "shall have regard to" carries.  We cannot stop people from voting the way they want and we cannot legislate for people making their own mind up in a democracy, yet bad decisions have been made and we should address the issue.The Labour Party agrees in principle that the issue should be considered but we want to protect local democracy.  Any action should not interfere with local democracy and there may be other ways to proceed.  We have had a construction bubble, bad planning decisions, excessive zonings, etc., so there should have been a Green Paper and White Paper in the planning area.  We must ensure local democracy brings about the best planning.The Government and the Green Party in particular is trying to fix these problems but their actions may not work and may interfere with local democracy.  If the Labour Party was in Government, we would consider the possibility of appeal for rezoning decisions to An Bord Pleanála.  That may be a solution to bad planning decisions.  For example, a strategic development zone planning scheme could be appealed, with either developers or the public making the appeal.There is a need to address the problem of councils making the wrong decisions but, at the same time, we either have democracy or we do not.  We must allow the people to make up their own minds.  There is an idea that a magic phrase can be used to make councillors think in a particular way but that is a nonsense.  Democracy means a person can think one way or another and make a choice of "Yes" or "No".  We cannot get into people's brains and make them decide in a particular way.I am raising the point but I do not necessarily think there is a set of words that will do the trick.  On planning in general we should consider the issues more deeply than is evident in this Bill.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I can empathise with the concerns of Deputy Tuffy.  With regard to the Smith v. Meath County Council, the issue was the regional planning guidelines and the county development plan.  To my recollection it did not involve the co-ordination between adjoining development plans.  I made a similar mistake this morning in discussion with officials on the use of these words and phrases.  This amendment concerns itself with how two adjoining development plans take each other into account.  The phrase we are using is “take into account” instead of “have regard to”.  There has been consultation with the Attorney General on the best form of words in this case.The Deputy alluded to the second issue.  What if the wrong decision is made by a local authority?  The last position a Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wants to be in is to say a local authority's decision is wrong.  I like the suggestion of the issue going to a higher authority that is not the Minister but there is a problem.  If, for example, An Bord Pleanála were to be given a responsibility of oversight of development plans, as the board would have to adjudicate on individual planning decisions there would always be a conflict in such cases.  It would not be as easy as giving the board oversight in this regard.The Bill in broad terms will ensure there is much less toing and froing between the Minister and relevant local authorities.  That is good because the last thing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wants is to consider individual development plans from the 88 planning authorities around the country.  Amendment No. 7 proposes the substitution of "have regard to" with "take into account".  The provision whereby planning authorities must have regard to the development plans of adjoining planning authorities is appropriate.  I hope I did not muddy the waters earlier.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I would like to respond to a number of the points made by the Minister of State.  My proposal in respect of An Bord Pleanála is not a fixed idea.  I am merely suggesting that is possible.  I believe there is a need to look more fundamentally at planning issues.  As I understand it, some countries do not allow the type of zoning we allow.  One can have too much or too little zoning.  As I have stated previously, zoning allowed land to become valuable and not zoning resulted in other land becoming valuable.  There is a need to look at planning in a more fundamental way and this could perhaps be done from now on.  NAMA has been established and there is much happening in respect of construction.  Many councils are currently not zoning, which is something I would have pushed for on my local council.  Managers believe enough land has been zoned to keep us going for some years.There is a crisis in the planning area to which councils are responding.  I believe this legislation is doing likewise.  I agree with the legislation in principle and accept that the Green Party's intentions are good in terms of trying to address problems in current planning legislation.  However, the Bill only tinkers with the issue and could cause problems.  I also believe some of its provisions are undemocratic, which is the reason for my tabling certain amendments.There is a need for legislation in this area to be consolidated, which is, perhaps, a matter for another day.  In terms of the issue dealt with in the amendment, there is a need to examine the phrasing used in planning legislation to ensure it is consistent throughout.  We should pick one phrase and then stick with it, which I again accept is another day's work.

In page 11, to delete lines 4 to 29.The most disserving aspect of this Bill is the undermining of local democracy.  Too many powers are being transferred to regional authorities.  The Bill transfers powers from locally elected representatives who are the people at the coalface.  We are all aware of the functions of local government in any democratic state.  It is the machinery by which important services are delivered.

I reiterate my belief that local democracy is enshrined in law and that only the big picture, strategic issues, is addressed in national and regional policy.  Local decisions will continue to be made by local people.  The Bill strikes a better balance between national, regional and local interests.  There is greater emphasis within the Bill on energy security, climate change and flood risk management.  One needs only to recall the pictures on our television screens within the last year of flooding of developments built only a couple of years ago to realise we need a more robust planning system, one that takes into account the wider national strategies, that examines river basin management, climate change and the connection between transportation and zonings.  I believe this to be democracy.  Involving regional authorities in their oversight makes sense.  The last thing we want is for the Minister to have to intervene in this area, which is the purpose of this Bill.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	359	The Minister is through this Bill proposing to transfer powers from locally elected representatives to regional authorities.  We all know the reason regional authorities were set up by the former Progressive Democrats when in government with Fianna Fáil was to draw down funding from Europe.  One cannot be directly elected to a regional authority but must be appointed by one's respective local authority.  I served on a regional authority for a number of years.  They are only talking shops.  Real power lies with the local authorities.  I believe we should be enhancing local authorities' powers.  I have never heard of representations being made to a regional authority member.  People make their representations to their locally elected representatives.  We have many plans, including local area plans, county development plans, regional plans and so on, but no action by Government.We are all aware of the flooding that occurred throughout the country last year.  In this regard reference was made to Cork, the midlands, including Longford-Westmeath and Roscommon.  Following the flooding, the Government promised the construction of flood defences but no action has been taken.

However, he promised support would be provided for the unfortunate individuals concerned but has not to date delivered.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, would take my plea on behalf of those people to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to ensure the promises and commitments made are delivered on.

I want this Bill to make sure the planner and the county manager know there is always flooding under the railway bridge on the Strokestown Road.  We should not give planning permission for houses under the railway bridge on the Strokestown Road, even if there is pressure from councillors to rezone land there.

I am making it clear that regional authorities should participate in the public consultation process and in the development of planning, given that they adopt the regional planning guidelines.

I know people who have prime sites in rural and urban Ireland.  They are not allowed to construct a house if the site is on a hill, or any sort of a rise in the ground.  In recent times, people have been forced to locate their houses in a hollow, or at the bottom of a hill.  They are told to move from scenic areas down into the valleys.  I live in a house that was built on a prime site almost 300 years ago, in 1728.  It is not a blight on the countryside.  I am proud of my home, as are many other people whose homes were built at that time.  This is a serious problem throughout the length and breadth of this country.  Planners are forcing people to construct their homes in hollows.  I would like this matter to be addressed in the guidelines the Minister issues to planners.  People are being forced to build their houses in valleys, hollows and flood plains.  This is a serious situation.  A neighbour of mine who applied for planning permission was told last week to locate his new home down from the hill and into the hollow.  This does not make sense.  The decisions of planners will create problems in the not too distant future and in years to come.

In page 11, line 11, after "guidelines" to insert the following:"and have due regard to development plan guidelines".The purpose of this amendment is to ensure development plan guidelines are of almost equal importance to the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines.  It has been proposed on foot of a suggestion made by a former Member of this House, Mr. Roger Garland.  If the Minister of State can make a quick comment on it, I would appreciate it.

He suggested that planners do not want people to build on the tops of mountains and that they are forcing everyone to live in the lowlands.  I suggest that proper planning would pay greater attention to building halfway up the hill — not at the top of the hill where one's roof would be blown off and——
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Not in the valleys

If one takes all the relevant factors into account, one can find the perfect combination.  In fairness, Deputy Bannon should withdraw his insult to the planning profession.Amendment No. 9 proposes that the phrase "and have due regard to development plan guidelines" be included in the core strategy provision that will be set out in the new section 10(1A) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The core strategy has a specific function within the development plan, namely, to provide relevant information on how the plan and the housing strategy are consistent with the regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  The development plan guidelines are published under section 28 of the 2000 Act, which is also being amended by this Bill.  Therefore, planning authorities are required to have regard to them when they are preparing and implementing their development plans.  The amendment is not necessary for that reason and I do not propose to accept it.

As Deputies are aware, the function of the planning system is to support the sustainable development of land in the interests of the common good.  Development plans are intended to provide the strategic framework and policy contexts for all local planning decisions.  They are frameworks for initiating and influencing the process of change in our surroundings, in order to support the wider economic, social and environmental objectives of the community.

During a flooding incident a couple of year ago, the Minister made a big announcement that was publicised by a newspaper.  He said he intended to introduce the national adaptation strategy earlier than intended, but it is late at this stage, in fact.  When will we see the strategy?  If the Minister wants county councils to produce local adaptation strategies, the national strategy needs to be available.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	388	This specific and technical amendment proposes the inclusion of three additional points in an existing section of the Bill.  It is part of a section that deals with new ways of looking at things, and not before time.  Better construction standards have been voluntarily adopted by local authorities in places like Dún Laoghaire.  Contrary to what Deputy Bannon has suggested, we are statutorily requiring local authorities to ensure that when planning permission is awarded for houses, that will not lead to increased guzzling of gas and oil.  As we do not have such resources, we have to import them.  The price of oil will increase as we approach peak oil.  One of the elements of the Government strategy is an attempt to create more self-sufficient forms of energy.  That will involve reducing our energy usage, where possible.  If local authorities do not take on board the need to reduce energy demand in response to the likely increases in energy costs, a further unwarranted expense will be placed on people as they move into new homes.  BER standards are significantly higher in areas with newer buildings than they are in more settled areas.  Therefore, the energy costs of residents in such areas are lower.  As we move down the line, there will be two types of residents.  There will be those who are being crucified by high energy costs and those who have managed, through the insulation schemes or proper planning, to reduce their bills.I particularly welcome the second and third additions relating to greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to climate change.  They are directly in line with what Deputy Bannon said, and I praise him for bringing this up.  Floods have always happened and, as the Minister of State has said, certain areas are prone to flooding.  Met Éireann has predicted that because of climate change we will have more rainfall in Ireland and, therefore, more floods.  Local authorities must consider the effect of climate change over a period of time.  Climate does not refer to the weather this year or next year but to conditions over a period of time.  In my constituency, for example, Lucan village was flooded in 1993 and 2000.  The local authority said this was a one in 100 year flood.  If this sort of legislation is enacted the council might say it was more like a one in 30 or 40 year flood.  Therefore, we must strengthen river defences.  We must also make sure that planning permission is not granted to build on flood plains.This measure copperfastens the protection of both rural and urban communities by making sure planners take local issues and topography on board, as well as the changing national climate.  This will ensure that we properly plan and develop low cost energy efficient homes that will not need expensive flood insurance.  This is very welcome.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	389	One of my best friends has a house on top of a hill beside her former home.  It fits in quite well.  Her son wanted to build half way down the hill but was not allowed.  Planners insisted that he build right at the bottom of the hill.  His builder checked the foundations and found that piling would be necessary to build there.  Planners do not get everything right.  That was an example of absolute stupidity.I completely support efforts to minimise the use of oil and other non-renewable forms of energy.  Everything that can be done should be done to build and insulate our houses in a way that minimises energy use.  I did that as far back as 1971.  I put in double glazing, insulation and a wood burning stove.  There was no word then of green issues but that is how our house was built in 1971.  I am totally in favour of making sure that houses are built to the highest possible standard.  This is much more important than building massive houses that people do not want and on which they must paying high mortgages.  In that context, I support this type of measure.However, we must have some local democracy.  In County Monaghan, we have suffered as a result of ultimatums to stop people building homes on their own farms.  That is not good enough.

Where there are existing buildings is often a good place to consider construction.  Those who built 50, 100 or 200 years ago had to think long, hard and carefully about where to build because they did not have JCBs or oil.  Deferring to our ancestors makes a lot of sense.Deputy Tuffy spoke about the adaptation strategy.  I want to see that strategy published as soon as possible.  We have already published the guidelines for planning authorities on the planning system and flood risk management.  These are a key step towards adaptation to climate change, certainly in the area of flooding.  We must respond to many other aspects of climate change.  The question of cheap and abundant oil feeds into that.  Reducing energy demand has an influence over the type of settlement pattern we choose.  I am glad we have published guidelines on flood risk management.  They are a key step towards not repeating the mistakes of the past.

Funding for the greener home scheme is not sufficient to encourage people to insulate their homes.  This needs to be looked at seriously.  When Deputy John Gormley became Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government he introduced two grant schemes.  I understand one of those schemes has been discontinued in recent months.  The Minister's spin on this was to say the schemes were being amalgamated.  This matter needs to be addressed.With regard to serious flooding of homes, I ask the Minister of State to carry out a national survey of the number of people who have requested local authorities to provide channels in front of their homes to prevent water from public roadways entering their properties.  I know of huge numbers of people in counties Longford and Westmeath who have asked that channels be provided in front of their homes to prevent flooding.  This problem was created by planners' decisions to locate properties in low-lying areas.  The result of such a survey would be very interesting and I am sure the Minister of State will embark on such a survey.

I understand the Minister of State has had conversations with Roger Garland about this provision.  He raised concerns on behalf of the hill walking group with which he is associated.

Can the Minister of State comment on this matter?

I am conscious of the debate between land owners and worthy NGOs, such as that with which Mr. Garland is associated.  In fairness, I must speak to the amendments in front of me, which deal with sustainable development.  They are important and are a step in the right direction.I would be willing to look at the flooding issue and the relevant planners' reports to see how many of them were granted on the recommendation of the county manager and how many came through the Section 4 process or, more recently the section 140 process, which I think has given cause for concern.Flooding is a real issue.  I recently had a communication from a colleague saying his annual insurance premium went up by €150 this year.  When he queried it he was told the increase was because of flooding.  Proper planning will lead to benefits in the longer term and to increases in insurance premiums becoming less likely.  We must have this joined-up thinking.  We cannot act in isolation from river basin strategies, strategic planning and local planning.  We must join the dots between local, regional, national planning and other strategies on energy use and flood risk management.

I have held the view for a long time that because those aged under 18 do not have the franchise we often tend to overlook their needs which are often different from those of older people.  In the kinds of discussions one has in council chambers, as I did in the 12 years I was a councillor, we tended to see young adults or older children as a problem to get rid off rather than as a social challenge for whom to provide.  Whether in the type of parks we create or in the provision of safe routes to school, we need to look long and hard within the development plan process at how we can best incorporate the needs of children.I mentioned this matter shortly after my appointment and I am glad to incorporate this in the Bill.

In page 30, to delete lines 10 to 50 and in page 31, to delete lines 1 to 10.This amendment relates to the national spatial strategy and I strongly believe it should be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The national spatial strategy was never voted upon but was brought about by Government.  Bad decisions were made, especially in the midlands.  There was a great deal of ministerial influence at the time and city status was given to three towns in the region, Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  Towns such as Portlaoise and Longford were ignored and were not given even hub status.  At the time, I was of the view that one town, probably Athlone or Mullingar, should have been given gateway status and all the other towns in the region should have been given hub status.  This should be reviewed again.The national spatial strategy was intended to cover the development of Ireland over a 20 year period but a bad decision was made regarding the midlands.  There was too much political influence and although the document should have been voted upon, this did not happen.  Any proposal that is as important as the national spatial strategy should be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas and decided upon there.  I was not a Member of either House at the time but I understand there was very little debate on the national spatial strategy document.  In other words, a dog's dinner was made of it in regard to the midlands.We now see the situation of our hospitals and other infrastructure where there is one bit here and another bit there, taken from another place.  Communities have been divided and everybody is fighting for their own powers and dominance.  This does not benefit the midlands.  There is a considerable absence of infrastructure in the region with the continuing downgrading of the Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar which is in a prime location on the M4 motorway, the only large hospital on the route between Dublin and Sligo.There is no rail link between any of the towns in the midlands.  When the country was under British rule there was a link between Athlone and Mullingar.  Deputy O' Rourke, who is still a Member of this House, proposed to renew that link when she held the portfolio of Minister for Transport.  For a long time I have advocated the opening of a rail link——

In addition, we need upgrading of the M4 motorway to continue it from Mullingar to Longford, linking up with the route from Sligo which has come back as far as Rooskey.  That area of the midlands has been neglected as has the tourism potential of the region.  There should be a greater focus on the development of the midlands in the national spatial strategy but this is not taking place at present.

It is crucial that we get the big picture material right because from that will flow the right kind of decisions that will impact on even the smallest communities.We spoke about the national spatial strategy several times at earlier stages.  The national spatial strategy is Government planning policy and it has the democratic mandate of the Oireachtas.  There was extensive consultation and research undertaken prior to the publication of the strategy in 2002.  There were over 60 consultation sessions with all kinds of stakeholders throughout the country.  The key implementation elements of the strategy, such as the regional planning guidelines, the city and county development plans and the local area plans were all devised and approved by elected members in the regions and in the counties.  It is within these planning documents that effect is given to translating the strategy into real actions and policies.  Therefore, I would argue that there already is strong democratic accountability on the shaping of planning policy at a regional and local level, within the broad parameters set down in the strategy.We are not trying to re-invent the wheel here.  We have a 20 year timeline for a strategy and we want to make sure it is delivered.  The first indications are that a lack of co-ordination is diminishing the impact, the importance and the efficacy of the national spatial strategy.

There was very little debate in this House on the strategy.  There is a view among the public that we got it wrong on the strategy.  For example, I served on the Midland Health Board and there was never a whimper of a new hospital for Tullamore at the time.  An upgrading of the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar was agreed as the hub for the midlands when the hospital in Longford was closed.  When he was Minister for Health and Children and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen waved the magic wand and decided that he wanted that facility in Tullamore.  The north midland area has suffered since then because services are constantly being withdrawn from the hospital in Mullingar.Last year in this Chamber I highlighted the fact that there was a phantom consultant dermatologist in place, and people were being conned——

Only for the planning that was given in Monaghan to small industries on people's own farms, we would have very little industry today.  There has been much talk about the hub towns and other things, but no industry has ever been provided in them to facilitate the houses that have been built on them.  We need to be much more positive in how we deal with things as they happen.One example of this is Moffatt engineering at Clontibret, which is a firm known worldwide and was set up in a farmer's back yard.  The company is still there today and there is another company outside Monaghan as well.  A bit of common sense allowed that to develop and if we went by today's plans, that would not happen.  We need to be very careful that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.

Deputy Crawford mentioned the issue of job creation in Monaghan.  The idea of having a strategy is to make sure that the jobs are located where the people live.  In the past, the houses have too often been zoned in the wrong areas and people now have to commute many miles to work.  The whole idea of having a strategy is to ensure that planners and the elected local authority members have recourse to take these things into consideration.  Anything that attempts to delete that overarching guidelines is quite dangerous.

We have been let down far too often, because there has been political interference and nod and wink politics.  The Green Party is aware of that and was critical of Fianna Fáil behaviour when it was in Opposition for many of the decisions the Government took when the national spatial strategy document was approved.  It would make sound common sense to have a vote and have the national spatial strategy document approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There should not be interference from outside bodies and the Minister of State got a little hot under the collar when I mentioned the Galway tent.  He was fairly critical of the cronies of Fianna Fáil who were in the Galway tent over the years.  I know that the Taoiseach abolished the idea of the Galway tent, but it would not be in existence anyway in today's climate.  It went because there was no money in the country and there was nobody there to support it any longer.There was no vote on the national spatial strategy and I would like to see that happen in these Houses.  After all, people expect us to take real decisions and this is a 20 year plan for the development of our country.

It seems that one half of the Opposition is trying to water down the proposals and the other half is trying to strengthen the requirements.  It is a challenge for the Opposition to speak with one voice when it comes to their thoughts and concerns on this Bill.The strengthening of the Bill is important, as planning authorities will now have to demonstrate, by way of statement, when preparing and making a draft development plan how it has implemented the policies and objectives of the Minister contained in ministerial guidelines.The Labour Party's amendment proposes the substitution of the words "take into account" for the word "consider" in regard to policies.  We believe that the word "consider" is wholly appropriate as this consideration is in the context of the statement that the planning authority has been obliged to append to the draft development plan or the development plan as the case may be, which must demonstrate how the planning authority has implemented the policies and objectives of the Minister contained in ministerial guidelines issued under section 28.The amendment is not being accepted.  The substantial point to be made is that there is disagreement, if not disarray, on the Opposition benches as to whether we need to tighten up or loosen the planning process.

We do not want the powers of those people who were elected to local authorities to be undermined.  I do not want any increased powers given to regional authorities above those held by local authorities.  The Minister of State should understand that.

If the Labour Party were to go into government with the Green Party, we would have many more similarities than with Fine Gael but, as I have said in previous statements, it is all about numbers.I am intrigued that Deputy Bannon is holding the fort for the Fine Gael Bench on environmental issues.  That is quite apt because the proposal to delete this section — it was not tabled by Deputy Bannon but by Deputy Hogan — is absolutely bonkers.  There would be sense in deleting this section if the Fine Gael Deputies had succeeded in having their previous amendments passed, but given that they were not accepted, the proposal to delete this section is illogical.  I refer in particular to section 20(1B)(b), which states: "if applicable, that the planning authority has formed the opinion that it is not possible, because of the nature and characteristics of the area or part of the area of the development plan, to implement certain policies and objectives of the Minister contained in the guidelines when considering the application of those policies in the area or part of the area of the draft development plan or the development plan and shall give reasons for the forming of the opinion and why the policies and objectives of the Minister have not been so implemented."Deleting the section would go against everything Deputy Crawford has been saying in terms of specific local instances where exceptions may need to be made and where people on the ground may have that specialist knowledge.  Retaining this section means that the local authority members and the planners can plead a special case to the Minister.  I have made previous arguments as to why the Minister should have those overarching powers.  Pleading a special cases means that in some circumstances there may be some wiggle room for manoeuvre to meet those local circumstances.Deputy Bannon on the other hand suggests that the deletion of this section would strengthen local democracy.  If anything, it would lead to more conflict between the Minister of the day and the local authorities.  Given that the guidelines are in place to strengthen local democracy and for local authority members to have recourse to them, deleting this section would make the link between the developer and business donations to politicians a live issue at least until the point at which we would get rid of this in the programme for Government.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	441	We will all be looking forward to the Minister, Deputy Gormley's Green Paper on local government.  He said prior to being appointed Minister — I have followed the statements he has made — that he does not believe in all the various bodies, namely, local authorities and regional authorities; he believes there is too much representation at regional level.  I await with interest to see if he will contradict himself when he publishes the Green paper on local government.It is wrong to remove powers from local public representatives who are elected by the people in their different wards and areas.  The regional authorities, as we all know, are a talking shop.  I served on the Midland Regional Authority and it was nothing but a talking shop.  It had no real powers and it delivered nothing.  It was a facility for some members to attend and to be a member of another committee but they had no powers or clout.  The public look to the locally elected members to deliver on services.  I do not want there to be any increase in powers given to regional authorities in this regard or any powers taken from locally elected representatives.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I support Deputy Bannon on this point.  I raised this issue on Committee Stage.  I refer to the idea that councils must have regard to regional planning guidelines, the new provisions in this Bill in that regard and the drawing up of regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  I am referring to the essential point made by Deputy Bannon.  Regional authorities are not directly accountable to the electorate.  I also served on a regional authority and it was a talking shop; we had very little input into the matters dealt with.  I was on the subcommittee that drew up the regional planning guidelines for greater Dublin area and I had very little say.  The way I was slotted into the procedure was very much to rubber stamp the guidelines while the officials had the edge.Decisions about planning should rest with elected representatives because they are accountable to the electorate.  If they make bad decisions, then the electorate can do something about it.  The Green Party may find it a problem that people are sometimes elected again and again and it might not agree with their particular policies.  However, that is democracy.  That is politics and that is what it is about.  The Green Party has a philosophical problem with democracy and that is not a good thing.

These provisions mean that the Minister of the day, who is elected by the people and by Dáil Éireann, can make a strategic decision in the best interests of all the people and not just a select few in a particular area.  Councillors in different areas will generally make the correct decisions, but  it does not make sense strategically, for example, to build a large number of houses in Leitrim.  Deputy Bannon referred to ghost towns in Longford.  There is no point in councillors being allowed carte blanche to rezone land in Leitrim and Longford when there is neither the population nor the employment opportunities to support that.If a poor decision is made by a local authority — often in the past such decisions were influenced by developers with, in some cases, legitimate donations being given — the Minister must have the power to call a halt and to amend the development plan.  That is what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has done on several occasions in recent years in respect of decisions by some Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors in particular.  This provision strengthens that capability of the Minister but also affords local authorities the facility to appeal such decisions and to plead special circumstances.  That will protect local input and address specific local issues of concern.

The Deputy's amendment proposes to extend the period for which a draft direction is available for inspection by the public from two to four weeks.  As regards the timeframe available to the public to make submissions on draft ministerial directions to amend a development plan or local area plan, it must be borne in mind that such directions are specific in terms of which aspect of the plan is proposed to be amended.  There is no question of members of the public having to familiarise themselves with the details of the total plan.  Rather, they need only deal with the specific issue or issues set out in the draft direction.  The two-week period is sufficient to allow the public to consider the Minister's specific concerns on particular issues and to make any submissions accordingly.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I move amendment No. 27:
In page 36, to delete lines 35 to 38.This amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (17) of the new section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as inserted by section 21 of the Bill.  The original section 31 allowed the Minister to intervene where he or she has concerns about a particular development plan, allowing him or her to direct the planning authority to amend the plan in order to comply with requirements under the section.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has used this provision, and there was a similar provision in older planning legislation which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would have used when he was Minister in order to ensure development took place in accordance with proper planning standards.  I have no difficulty with the original section of the principal Act, which functioned as a safety net, or with how the Minister has used it.However, I have a fundamental difficulty with the new section 31 to be inserted in the Act by way of section 21 of this Bill.  In particular, I have a difficulty with the new subsection (17) which I am proposing should be deleted.  The Minister should not have interfered with the original section 31, which has worked effectively for him.  An issue emerged recently arising from an intervention by the Minister in regard to the Mayo County Council development plan.  This issue was examined by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which issued a recommendation that there should be a facility for the Minister to consult with councillors and officials regarding his or her directions.  Subsection (17) is in contravention of that.Fianna Fáil in government seems to have been absolutely blinded by one particular provision.  Deputy Fleming welcomed some of the new measures the other day, but he seems to be unaware of what the rest of the section does which is greatly to complicate the original section 31 by introducing an extremely elaborate process that will be time consuming for both the Department and the planning authority.  Planning authority officials are reduced to passive participants in regard to the Minister's intervention.  Subsection (17) states:  "The direction issued by the Minister under subsection (16) is deemed to have immediate effect and its terms are considered to be incorporated into the plan, or, if appropriate, to constitute the plan".  In other words, by means of the direction he or she can issue under the new section 31, the Minister can effectively make the development plan while the planning authority is left powerless other than making submissions in regard to the Minister's direction.  That is fundamentally undemocratic.Is the Minister's partner in government, the Fianna Fáil Party, asleep?  Although it suffered substantial losses in the last local elections, that party still has hundreds of councillors, while the Green Party has only three.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The Green Party no longer has any interest in democracy.  That is the bottom line; the Green Party does not care about local democracy.  I do not know why the Minister is bothering to introduce a White Paper when, if this is a sign of what is to come, it looks like he plans to erode local democracy gradually.  It is essentially a matter of centralising power in the hands of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Green Party has developed a narrative where it places all the blame for past planning mistakes on the councillors from the various parties including my own party, even though it was our representatives — people such as Eithne FitzGerald and Frank Buckley — who were fighting poor rezoning decisions and taking brave stands long before the Green Party had any local authority members.I was on the council with Deputy Gogarty and we had a lot in common.  I accept he made good decisions on planning and we were often on the same side.  No matter what I think about other people's decisions, however, it is a fundamental tenet of democracy that I allow people to make a decision.  They are elected by the public and they make decisions, ideally under a framework that allows for the best decisions, but if they make bad decisions, that is democracy and that electorate can deal with that at election time.I was directly elected to this House, as was every other Deputy and it is democratic that we make our own decisions.  We are then held accountable and we can explain the decisions we made.  The Bill allows a Minister to make a development plan when that is a fundamental aspect of the role of councillors.The story that all bad planning decisions were thanks to councillors exercising their democratic mandate is not true, often the decisions that were questionable were thanks to ministerial guidelines.  The ministerial guidelines for higher residential density led to apartment complexes being built in small villages in Leitrim.  The then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, introduced those guidelines, leaving councils with no choice but to implement them.  The idea the Minister will be always pure, protecting people from the councillors they elected, is rubbish and I have a fundamental problem with that.  I cannot see how any elected representative can stand over it.  The Minister is not elected by the people, he is part of the Cabinet and there is too much power resting with the executive as it is.  It is a common agreement that power is now vested in the Cabinet and it now rides roughshod over Government backbenchers like Deputy Mattie McGrath.On Committee Stage, the amendments formed a bigger document than the Bill and there are even more amendments today.  That has muddied the waters, allowing elements to go through that will erode democracy.  The principle is fine that planning must be reformed, and safety nets must be provided to ensure councillors and planning officials take into account the right things, but this removes the power of local authorities to make their own development plans and that is wrong.

It provides much enhanced provision for public participation at each stage of the development plan process.  Instead of last minute rezonings, it will provide for better participation and access to justice.  It will greatly reduce the need for ministerial intervention.  This amendment would apply to a section that deals with comprehensive consultation arrangements before a ministerial direction is finalised; I would have thought that would be welcome.  This is about joining up transport and land use, exactly what we need.Midleton in Cork is a good example.  Before the brand new commuter train service was put in place there was a discussion and improvements in land use provisions to make sure——
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13721	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Is the Minister of State aware of the situation with the Midleton train at present?  If he wants to speak authoritatively, he should check his facts.

In my county an €80 million sewage plant is under discussion.  That must have an impact on the land use and transport decisions that are made, such as if a Luas line should cross a particular piece of land.  We cannot put blinkers on and divorce land use, transportation, sewerage and water infrastructure issues.  When it comes to big picture planning, not only do we need consistency, we also need co-ordination, which is what this is all about.

In some ways, this increases democracy because often it is the unelected manager who rules the roost.  Now, the Minister will be able to set out guidelines and intervene.  The Minister will have the power to look at special cases and ensure local issues are taken on board.There is a fundamental disagreement in this debate about what constitutes democracy and what constitutes the lowest effective level.  As a member of the Green Party, I have always pushed for decision making at the lowest effective level but, unfortunately, decision making at that level in the past did not prove to be that effective.This planning Bill must be taken in the context of the White Paper on local government and the plans for the Dublin mayor, where new regional assemblies are being planned with much more influence and clout that will in most cases take over from the Minister so he has less direct influence, with the guidelines ensuring it is barely necessary to contact him.  As long as elected members stick within the framework, there will not be a problem.  It is fundamentally undemocratic to allow a small number of elected representatives to make decisions that have far reaching implications beyond their local area without a framework.

The rezoning of Adamstown has had major influence on people in Kildare and Lucan.  I was involved in the Deliver It Right campaign and Deputy Tuffy made many submissions to An Bord Pleanála on this issue.  Local authorities cover specific local areas and the impact of these decisions goes far beyond them, affecting water supply in neighbouring counties, water quality, traffic issues, public transport and the sharing of scarce resources.Sometimes the power of a Minister appointed by a democratically elected Dáil is necessary to ensure the framework is adhered to.  The Minister of the day may have different views from a Green Party Minister, and may not make decisions the Green Party would like but, fundamentally, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and in that context there must be an over-arching framework.  That is what it is doing.  It is not taking away micro-management or the democratic input of elected local authority members, it is making sure they stick to the framework.  It is like a GAA match, players can score as many points as they want within the confines of the pitch but if they stray off it, they are playing illegally.  This is what the Minister is trying to do here.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13721	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The guidelines that are published are only guidelines.  When Deputy Batt O'Keeffe was Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he published guidelines on the relaxation of rules for one-off houses in rural areas.  The guidelines that were issued stated councillors must have regard to development plans as they existed in local authority areas.However, the local development plan itself had very stringent rules and regulations on green belt areas, and certain types of designations for particular areas which superseded the guidelines themselves.  It did not make any change whatsoever to the number of one-off houses built as a result of the publication of those guidelines.Similarly, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, published guidelines last week — or gave notice of his intention to publish guidelines — on houses on national secondary routes.  I am aware of three cases of people who have a genuine housing need who wish to build on family owned land on a national secondary route.  I have regard to the guidelines published by the Minister but I am told by the local authority that the development plan, which was adopted by the members elected by the people will supersede those guidelines.  There is a precedent whereby a local authority granted planning on a national secondary route and it was appealed by the NRA to An Bord Pleanála in any case.The issuance of guidelines is a bit of a sham to be honest.  Sometimes, they are deliberately put out there by Ministers to give voice to the idea that they are somehow dealing with an issue.  In reality, I have never seen them have an effect in how they are transposed.  The local development plan as passed under a reserve function always seems to take precedent.In essence, the point I am trying to make is that if we further diminish the power of local public representatives to intervene in planning cases or in the planning laws, too much power will be ceded to the Minister who may not have regard to local factors and the grey area that exists which might push a case one way or the other.  If too much power is prescribed in a centralised way it will have a negative impact on the ability of a local authority to function as it relates to planning, and good planning at that.I fail to understand the Green Party's position on this.  I state respectfully and without any malice that what Deputy Gogarty is saying in effect is that the gentlemen and ladies on local authorities have received their democratic mandates from the people but the Green Party does not trust them to exercise that mandate as it relates to the planning process and therefore it will instigate a set of rules and regulations that will supersede their powers.  By implication, what is stated is that the people are wrong.  The people put in the councillors and therefore there is an implication in the legislation that the councillors made mistakes and the Green Party will come along and rectify those mistakes in a condescending and patronising fashion.

However, with privilege I stand before the people here as a Member for Cork East and I will not allow other Members to debase the House's legislative programme by imposing legislation that is undemocratic and will have serious permutations for how local authorities will be able to operate because it gives too much power to the Minister.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Is the Minister of State aware of the contents of the statement made last week by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on the circular he sent to selected local authorities throughout the country?  The statement implies that there is a suspicion in his mind and that he queries the planning practices of those local authorities and their transparency.  Is the Minister aware of how those local authorities were selected?  If so, will he tell the House?  From what I tried to extract from the Department and other sources, it was on a numerical basis.  Is the Minister familiar with Galway County Council and the volume of applications received and referred to An Bord Pleanála?  He selectively and pointedly used the figures for how many applications were reversed and refused by An Bord Pleanála.  He based a judgment on this that was totally unfair.  He never gave a comparable figure for those that were refused by Galway County Council, appealed to An Bord Pleanála and subsequently granted.The circular states that the planning system provides that all planning files must be available for public inspection.  Every member of the public is invited by the public notice accompanying an application to pay a minimal fee for a duplicate of that application.  The Minister is trying to bring all the planning decisions to himself.  Is the Minister familiar at all with the processes?  Is this a stalling tactic?  This is an attempted indictment of something wrong in those areas based solely on numerical information that is totally wrong.

He is not familiar with the fact that birds directives, habitats directives, special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas cover approximately 60% of County Galway.  The local authorities in Galway have gone through them meticulously as the record will show.  As a former member of Galway County Council for 20 years I cannot but state today that the authorities, management and planners and everybody associated with it are people of the highest calibre and made decisions under all the criteria which had to be adhered to, which has always been the case.  The Minister made a spurious decision and selectively said a certain number of applications were submitted from Galway County Council and because of the volume and size of county they were refused.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, or the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who is responsible for this Bill, would come in and explain why that happened.

We want proper planning, but not at the expense of democracy which is a fundamental thing.  It is what we fought for in 1916 and 1922.  One does not erode democracy.  We, as politicians, should not be taking away local democracy and the mandate that councillor have.  Reforms have been made over the years to try to address the issue to which Deputy Gogarty referred and improvements can always be made.  One has to disclose donations and the amount spent on local elections.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government introduced limits on how much could be spent on local elections last year, which the Labour Party supported.Many different things have been done.  The vast majority of politicians operate in what they consider to be the best interests of the public but very often ideology comes in.  Housing was left to the free market and allowed to run rampant.  A huge part of the problem was ideology and Deputy Gogarty is in government with the very people who had such an ideology.Under the old section 31 provisions the Minister could intervene, make directions and tell the local authorities to amend or vary their county development plans.  At the end of the day the decision on the county development plan rested with the local councillors elected by the people.  It was quite a strict provision which the Minister used as a last resort.  It allowed an intervention by the Minister but the fundamentals of local democracy remained.  What is proposed is very much a dictatorship on the part of the Minister.  He can make the plan.The idea that the Minister will always make a pure decision is not correct.  I refer to South Dublin County Council.  The Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Bertie Ahern, wanted to build a stadium in his constituency.  It was a huge project which the Tánaiste at the time, Michael McDowell, said was a Ceaucescu project.  It never went ahead; God knows what it would have been like if it had.  Our council wanted an alternative proposal, the Eircom stadium.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	514	No, we wanted the Eircom stadium which the Football Association of Ireland wanted.  Everything was done at Government level to try to stop us making a democratic decision about the stadium because it wanted to promote Deputy Ahern's great big project, a huge potential white elephant.  The Government had the wrong point of view and the local councillors had the right idea and wanted to do something in the interests of the local community.Local councillors often have a good relationship with the local county manager and can sometimes do more than the average back bencher and the Government in terms of making decisions which are good for the local community.  I accept that bad decisions are sometimes taken but that is democracy and people are accountable through the electoral system and the many different reforms and legislation that makes them accountable, such as the Ethics in Public Office Act and so on.Deputy Gogarty betrayed something because the gist of what he said was that the lower levels, meaning councillors, cannot be trusted.  He also said something which indicated that he did not think the manager could be trusted, therefore the power should be given to the Minister.  I have set out an example which shows that Ministers do not always do the right thing.  What about the separation of national and local democracy?  By allowing Ministers to make local development plans, the Bill erodes local democracy.  The terrible thing is that Fianna Fáil Members are letting this happen because they are cowed by their party's own planning record.

The people who elect councillors have a fundamental say in local democracy and it would be a terrible irony if the outcome of the economic downturn and the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank is the loss of the people's right to give a  mandate to their local representatives.I will be pressing the amendment as I fear the Minister will do a Colm McCarthy and abolish councils because local democracies does not matter when it is all about money at the end of the day.

In page 41, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:"23.—Section 33(2) of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following new paragraph after paragraph (a):"(aa) a standard process to be drawn up for pre-application discussions on planning permission to facilitate a more efficient planning process and to promote planning transparency.”.”.The amendment is to provide a standardised process for drawing up whatever regulations are required in respect of pre-planning applications and pre-application discussions.  When this matter was raised on Committee Stage the Minister of State indicated he would express a view on Report Stage.  There is an inconsistency in the interpretation by county and city managers of what constitutes pre-application discussions.  If planning and development is to mean anything, we should ensure discussions take place on what constitutes proper planning and development.  Equally, when someone is prepared to invest a substantial amount of money, he or she should be able to have discussions before the formal process commences.  This can be done in a transparent manner, as the Minister of State indicated on Committee Stage.I move the amendment to provide for a more standardised system for pre-application discussions and ensure there is no equivocation or misunderstanding on the part of county and city managers about what is the appropriate way to deal with applications, investors and public representatives.

I await the Minister of State's comments in that regard.  For too long, the process of discussions between prospective applicants and unelected officials behind closed doors has cast an unwanted veil of suspicion.  Despite the heated debates and discussions we have, I acknowledge that the vast majority of local councillors from all parties try to represent their communities as best they can and seek to promote their view of what constitutes good planning.  Guidelines are required to ensure the impact of a local planning decision does not extend to a regional or national level.Having said that, if it is possible for a standard process to be drawn up, it would get rid of the suspicion of smoke-filled rooms, discussions behind the scenes and developers having the ear of the manager but the ordinary person not being able to come in.  While I will be guided by the Minister of State, if it is possible to insert this into the legislation it would be a very good idea.  If not, it is still a good idea to have some mechanism to allow a standard process to be drawn up.

In this regard, section 33 of the Act already provides that the Minster may "by regulations provide for such matters of procedure and administration as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient in respect of applications for permission for the development of land."  Accordingly, I do not consider that the proposed amendment is necessary.Under section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a person who has an interest in land and who intends to make a planning application to the planning authority may, with the agreement of the planning authority concerned, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, enter into pre-application consultations on the proposed development.  Section 247 also provides that a planning authority is required to keep a written record of such pre-consultation meetings.My Department's development management guidelines for planning authorities, issued in June 2007, are a step by step guide to all stages of the planning application process, beginning with pre-application consultations.  They give extensive recommendations to planning authorities on the matter of pre-application consultations and state that requests for consultations should be facilitated speedily — ideally within two to three weeks.  I do not see any difficulty in today's climate of that not happening.  These are statutory guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and planning authorities are obliged to have regard to them in carrying out their planning functions.  I will consider whether it is necessary to issue further recommendations to planning authorities on this matter.  In doing so I believe that takes into account the spirit if not the letter of the Deputy's intention.

Every public representative, whether local authority members of Oireachtas Members, will be very glad if there are clear guidelines giving consistency of treatment in the role of the public representative in accompanying applicants, if necessary, in pre-planning discussion, or the investor, whether small or large.  Everybody should understand how the system works and the Department should set down a model with which every local authority should comply.  I would welcome that correspondence would be sent to local authorities in that regard.  It is essential and urgent.  The anecdotal evidence the Minister of State will pick up from his colleagues around the House will suggest it is urgent.

whether through notification by the applicant or otherwise, that it has so failed, the authority shall proceed to make the decision notwithstanding that the first period has expired.(ii) Where a planning authority fails to make a decision within the first period, it shall pay the appropriate sum to the applicant.(iii) Where a planning authority fails to make a decision within a period of 12 weeks after the expiry of the first period a decision (referred to in this paragraph as the ‘deemed decision') of the planning authority to grant the permission shall be regarded as having been given on the last day of that period of 12 weeks.(iv) Any person, who has made submissions or observations in writing in relation to the planning application to the planning authority, may at any time within the period of 4 weeks after the expiry of the period of 12 weeks referred to in subparagraph (iii), appeal the deemed decision.(v) Subparagraphs (i) to (iv) shall not apply where there is a requirement under Part X or Part XAB to carry out an environmental impact assessment, a determination whether an environmental impact assessment is required, or an appropriate assessment, in respect of the development relating to which the authority has failed to make a decision.(vi) Where the planning authority has failed to make a decision in relation to development where an environmental impact assessment, a determination whether an environmental impact assessment is required, or an appropriate assessment is required within the first period and becomes aware, whether through notification by the applicant or otherwise, that it has so failed—(I) the authority shall proceed to make the decision notwithstanding that the first period has expired,(II) where a planning authority fails to make a decision within the first period, it shall pay the appropriate sum to the applicant,(III) provided that no notice under paragraph (b) or (c) was served on the applicant prior to the expiry of the first period, where a planning authority proceeds to make a decision under clause (I) in relation to an application, it may serve notice on the applicant, requiring the applicant to give to the authority further information or to produce evidence in respect of the application under paragraph (b) or (c), and paragraph (b) or (c) shall apply to such notice subject to any necessary modifications,(IV) subject to service of a notice under paragraph (b) or (c) in accordance with clause (III), where a planning authority fails to make a decision before the expiry of the period of 12 weeks beginning on the day immediately after the day on which the first period expires, the authority shall, subject to clause (V), pay the appropriate sum to the applicant, and shall pay a further such sum to the applicant where it fails to make a decision before the expiry of each subsequent period of 12 weeks beginning immediately after the preceding 12 week period,(V) not more than 5 payments of the appropriate sum shall be made by a planning authority to an applicant in respect of the failure by the authority to make a decision in relation to an application,(VI) where a planning authority makes a decision in relation to an application more than one year after the expiration of the first period the authority, before making the decision—(A) notwithstanding that notice has been previously published in relation to the application, shall require the applicant to publish additional such notice concerning the planning application in accordance with the permission regulations (and the planning authority shall refund the costs of so publishing to the applicant),(B) notwithstanding that notice of the application has previously been given to prescribed bodies, shall give additional such notice in accordance with the permission regulations, and(C) notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph (b) or (c), or that the authority has previously been given further information or evidence under those paragraphs may require the applicant to give to the authority further information or to produce evidence in respect of the application as the authority requires and paragraph (b) or (c), as appropriate, shall apply to such additional request subject to any necessary modifications, and the planning authority shall consider any submissions made in accordance with the Regulations following on such additional notices, or additional further information or evidence produced under this clause.(vii) Any payment or refund due to be paid under this paragraph shall be paid as soon as may be and in any event not later than 4 weeks after it becomes due.(viii) In this paragraph, ‘appropriate sum' means a sum which is equal to the lesser amount of 3 times the prescribed fee paid by the applicant to the planning authority in respect of his or her application for permission or €10,000.".".Currently, section 34(8)(f) provides that where a planning authority fails to make a decision on a planning application within the prescribed period, normally eight weeks from the date of lodgment, a decision to grant permission shall be regarded as having been given on the last day of the period, in other words a default permission.  This provision is now considered undesirable and has been criticised by the High Court and by the Supreme Court.  It means that if through administrative error a decision is not made on time, a wholly unsuitable form of development could be permitted, or even where the proposed development is acceptable in principle, no planning conditions may be attached.Under the amended provision a default decision to grant permission will only be deemed to be given 12 weeks after the expiration of the time for deciding the application.  It is considered most unlikely that a planning authority could continue to overlook an application for a further 12 weeks, as inquiries would be made by people who had made submissions, so in practice it is not expected that there will be default decisions to grant permission.  In addition if it fails to decide the planning application within the statutory period, the planning authority must pay to the applicant a sum of three times the application fee, subject to a maximum of €10,000.It is being provided that the default decision to grant permission will not apply to applications for development which require environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment under the habitats directive.  In such cases the following provisions will apply.  Where the planning authority fails to meet its statutory deadline, it must still proceed to decide the application and, as well as the initial fine, the planning authority will be required to pay a further fine of three times the application fee, subject to a maximum of €10,000, for each further 12-week period in which the planning authority fails to decide the application, subject to an overall maximum of €50,000.In the highly unlikely event of a year having passed without the planning authority making a decision on the planning application, the application will require to be advertised again at the expense of the planning authority and submissions invited from the public and prescribed bodies.  The planning authority will also be permitted to seek further information in such a case.It is self evident that this will concentrate the mind of the planning authority in question to decide on the application.  The very few examples we have seen over the years of a decision failing to be made in time will disappear.  This will ensure that decent decisions are made in proper time.

It just arrived in front of me.  It was the first time I saw it.  It was not even pointed out to me.  It was on my desk.The manner in which this legislation is being dealt with is inappropriate.  Planning is a fundamental issue that relates to the issue of local democracy.  I have a fundamental problem with the issue I already raised in amendments Nos. 27 to 29.  I had other issues I wanted to raise.  I have concerns about proposals on strategic developments, which I raised on Committee Stage.  I still do not understand what the Minister of State is doing with that amendment and I am concerned that it might water down the provisions.  I could be wrong, but I wanted to find out.  I would have asked questions if we had reached that amendment.The Labour Party cannot support this.  I support in principle what the Minister of State is trying to do on planning, but I fundamentally oppose the principle of undermining local democracy and the way in which this Bill is being dealt with.  The Bill could have been taken next week.  We did not need to guillotine this discussion.  We will fail to discuss more than 90 amendments today and that is wrong.

In page 13, line 13, after "Partnership" to insert "and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants".On Committee Stage I accepted in principle a suggestion made by Deputy Flanagan in regard to the two distinct issues dealt with in this Bill.  Amendment No. 1 will avoid creating the impression that the Bill encapsulates all law which applies to cohabitants.  There has been an increasing recognition of cohabitation in legislation in recent years and different levels of recognition are afforded in different situations.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to establish the cohabitants redress scheme in Part 15 and not to incorporate all existing legislation on cohabiting couples.  Amendment No. 1 is framed to match the Short Title to those rights and obligations flowing from Part 15 and to make clear that the Bill does not provide the full body of law applicable to cohabitants.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	543	On the basis of what the Minister has said, I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 2.  This is an important issue.  It has been noticeable that much of the public and media debate on this issue has surrounded the civil partnership aspects of the legislation with particular reference to the new and welcome arrangements in respect of the registration of same sex couples and their partnership.The debate on the matter of cohabitants has not been as widespread, a matter that has been mentioned previously in the House.  It is essential that the element of the Bill dealing with the far-reaching reforming arrangements for cohabitants be given the status of mention in the Title of the Bill.  I am pleased the Minister has taken on board the suggestion.  From that point of view, amendment No. 2 is redundant and I will not be moving it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I agree with the change to the Title of the Bill.  We will have an opportunity later in the debate to revisit our discussions on cohabitation.  We are now discussing altering the Title of the Bill to broaden it to include the sections overtly on cohabitation, in regard to which I would like to say a few words.The Bill which I produced on same sex recognition, namely, the civil unions Bill, which was twice debated in this House, dealt only with the matter of same sex couples.  I am aware the terms of reference of the Law Reform Commission and Colley report were broader and came up with recommendations in respect of cohabitation.  As I said on Committee Stage, the focus we have had on the issue of same-sex unions has been so intense that we have probably not had the same level of scrutiny of the elements of the Bill that deal with cohabitation.  In general terms, I am sorry we are not dealing with two separate Bills.  Since the Committee Stage debate, I have read a critique of the Bill's cohabitation provisions by Professor John Mee of the UCC law faculty.  I will not take up too much of the time of the House rehearsing the arguments made by Professor Mee in the critique, which was published in the Irish Journal of Family Law.  He states:The second aim is to set up a scheme to create certain rights for cohabitants, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, upon the termination of a relationship outside of marriage or civil partnership.  It is unfortunate that the two separate issues are dealt with in the same Bill.  The argument in favour of introducing a civil partnership scheme for same-sex couples, or permitting such couples to marry, seems unanswerable.  [I think that is the view of everyone in this House].  However, the case for the introduction of legislation at this time in relation to informal cohabitation is actually much less strong than that in relation to civil partnership/same-sex marriage.While I agree with Professor Mee's point, we are where we are.  We need to spend some time during this evening's debate considering whether the cohabitation provisions we are enshrining in law are right.  Regardless of the publicity we give it, many cohabiting couples will remain unaware of this debate.  When this enactment becomes law, they will wake up to find that responsibilities they might not have envisaged have fallen upon them.  I do not want to overstate the case because I am conscious that all the Bill seeks to do is to give people who are financially dependent on others the right to access the courts.  It does not confer any automatic rights on them.  We need to speak clearly on this matter.  In hindsight, it probably would have been better to have dealt with these two separate issues — the same-sex unions issue and the cohabitation issue — in two separate Bills.  I do not object to the change in the Title of the Bill to reflect the actual contents of the enactment before us.

I want to take this opportunity to welcome the final stages of the passage of this legislation, which represents an important milestone on the road towards full equality.  I may differ from the Minister when it comes to the final destination on that road.  My view and that of my party is that there should be no distinction between genders with regard to marriage.  The final destination for me and for my party involves consenting adults having full and equal marriage rights, regardless of sexual orientation.I know that many people, particularly in the two larger parties in this Chamber, do not wish to see that.  The Bill before the House is an important milestone.  I say to those who are concerned about it, some of whom have expressed their concerns to me, that this is a question of civil rights.  It will give recognition to people who have been denied recognition for many years.  It is about more than civil partnership — it is also about giving rights to very vulnerable people in cohabiting relationships.  The CSO acknowledges that there are thousands of gay and lesbian couples in Ireland.  They deserve recognition by the State.  In addition, there are over 100,000 cohabiting couples of opposite genders.  I understand that there are approximately 75,000 children of such relationships in Ireland.This legislation gives recognition to such families and relationships as well.  Although this Bill does not go as far as I or my party would like, it represents very important progress on a journey that will probably take many years to reach its final destination.  Deputies around the Chamber may disagree about what that final destination should be, but almost everyone will agree that this measure marks progress as we move along the road towards recognising, cherishing and protecting the vulnerable in Irish society.

We do not have to refer to issues that are not dealt with in this legislation.  I would like to seek clarification from the Minister on foot of my concerns about what I perceive to be anomalies in the Bill before the House.  It seems to me, contrary to what media commentators and others have said, that there is some discrimination in the Bill.  I would like clarification on my interpretation of the rights that will be conferred on cohabiting couples by Part 15 of the Bill.  Perhaps amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which have been accepted by the Minister, will alleviate my concerns.  It seems from the definition of "cohabitant" that such couples may be treated differently from married couples.  The section I would like the Minister to clarify states:For the purposes of this Part, a qualified cohabitant means an adult who was in a relationship of cohabitation with another adult and who, immediately before the time that that relationship ended, whether through death or otherwise, was living with the other adult as a couple for a period—(a) of 2 years or more, in the case where they are the parents of one or more dependent children, and(b) of 3 years or more, in any other case.

He or she can seek a property adjustment order, a compensatory maintenance order or, under section 185, a pension adjustment order.  Married couples need to have been living apart for four or five years before they can seek such orders.  I ask the Minister to address that clear anomaly.  Why is there a difference between the treatment of cohabiting couples and married couples who have been living separately?  In the first case, redress can be sought after two years if there are children involved, whereas a married couple who have been living separately cannot get redress for four or five years.  I would like some clarification on that clear anomaly.

Given that I was following the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, I thought I was justified in making an argument on my interpretation of the Bill.

I want to comment on the issue of cohabitation, which has already been mentioned.  I welcome the rights that people will now enjoy in that regard.  A change was needed in that respect.  Individual Deputies are familiar with the cases of couples who lived together for years and had children.  When one of them died in an accident, for example, the other one did not have any rights.  We have all encountered live issues of that kind.  I was contacted by an unmarried lady who had been with her partner for more than 40 years, and whose children were reared.  When her partner died, she found that she had no rights, to all intents and purposes.  Before the Bill proceeds any further, will the Minister agree to include a conscience clause to allow people freedom, without having to go to court?  An officer of the court is permitted to withdraw from a case if he or she has a personal interest in the case.  With regard to civil partnership, however, there is no room for conscience.  No one has the right to refuse to take part in a civil partnership ceremony.  That is totally wrong.

I do not have a major problem with that.  My only reservation is that we are dealing with a civil partnership Bill and that we have not gone as far as we should have with regard to marriage equality.The amendments give a proper account of what is contained within the Bill, flawed as it is.  The fact that the Minister mentions certain rights indicates that not all rights are transferred to those who, after the passage of this Bill, will enjoy civil partnership. The next step mentioned by a previous speaker needs to be taken to address the rights which are not enjoyed by people who will take part in civil partnership but who might want to enjoy all the rights that would accrue to them if they were allowed, in this State, to enjoy the rights and privileges of a civil marriage rather than the religious marriage, on which some of the characters at the gate would confuse the issue.I particularly support the Minister's amendment No. 1 because it mentions certain rights.

Both amendments seek to include the word "cohabitants" after the word "partnership".  The Minister's amendment proposes including the words "certain rights and obligations of cohabitants" and the other simply proposes the addition of the word "cohabitants".I favour the Minister's wording but with a small caveat.  In Part 15, which deals with cohabitants, I cannot find any obligations for cohabitees listed.  There is a facility to seek redress from the courts, which could make orders.  If a court makes an order, there is an obligation on the person against whom the order is made to comply with it.  If that is the obligation referred to, I fully support it.  I understand that there are rights and that the principal right of a cohabitee under Parts 15 and 16 is the right to seek redress.  I understand that is the only principal right given in Parts 15 and 16.  However, I am not quite sure about the obligations.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on that.

I would say it is fortunate that we are dealing with the two issues in the one Bill.  Part 15 refers to the possible provision of a safety net for cohabiting same sex and opposite sex couples.  For too long, the Oireachtas has not provided rights, obligations, duties and statutory cover for cohabiting couples, particularly as a substantial and increasing number of people are living as man and wife but are not married.  When one consider the number of children born out of wedlock to people who are living together but not married, it is incumbent on the Oireachtas, sooner rather than later, to make this provision.  That is why I say it is fortunate that we are now dealing with this issue.Deputy McCormack referred to the safety net redress scheme provided for in Part 15.  This gives couples a right of access to court.  It does not give any statutory rights in relation to estates.  That will be for the court to decide.  The provision is framed in such a way as to apply to couples, both heterosexual and same sex, who have split up to go into court and, if one of them can show extreme financial difficulty, to ask that the court make financial provision for him or her.  Some critics of this provision have misread its purpose, which is to protect a financially dependent person who may be left high and dry if a couple split up.  There is good and valid reason for making a distinction between a couple who have children and a couple who do not.  Hence the two year and five year limits.

The Bill is a fine balance, as is required by the Constitution, between the constitutional provisions that people be equal in the eyes of the law and that marriage be protected.  Without a referendum, we must frame our law to meet the fine balance between those two, supposedly, contrasting provisions.  This is a fine balance.We have taken detailed legal advice from the Attorney General on every provision in the Bill in order to ensure that it will pass constitutional muster.  There may be people who will say it does not go far enough and others who will say it goes too far.  A commitment was made by my party in our manifesto before the last general election, confirmed in the programme for Government with the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats and further confirmed in the review of the programme for Government a year ago.Deputy Crawford referred to freedom of conscience.  There seems to be confusion on his side of the House.  His spokesperson did not put down an amendment asking for freedom of conscience to be included in the Bill.  I have already made the position clear on behalf of the Government.   It is not possible from a policy point of view nor, it must be said, from a practical point of view to allow a situation whereby a civil servant mandated by the Oireachtas to implement law can adopt an à la carte approach, depending on his or her view of this legislation, or the religious view he or she might have in regard to a situation.  This is especially the case in the State we now have, which is multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious.

I return to the statement my party issued in our manifesto when we proposed what we would do, based on our republican ethos and building on the agenda of equality to which we are committed.  We said we would address these issues and that is what we did.I say, resolutely, to people who suggest there should be a freedom of conscience clause, that if we pass laws in this House we expect them to be implemented.  If we allow a situation where people can adopt an à la carte approach to implementing the law on behalf of the Legislature we will leave ourselves, the taxpayer and the State wide open to a claim by those who will say they have been discriminated against because an official — in this case a registrar — may, for religious reasons, have refused them service.There has been no representation or indication of any kind regarding the freedom of conscience issue; rather there has been a positive view from people of what we are doing in this regard.  This comes from the Ard Cláiritheor's office and from registrars in general, who say they are more than happy with this provision.I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for his support.  I make the general point that it is not our fault this has not been widely publicised.  There was a consultation process and there was a law reform report in this area.  There was a Colley report which allowed for public consultation in all these areas, concerning both cohabitants and the issue of civil partnership. That process has been going on for some considerable time.  More or less, although not completely, this Bill embodies what was suggested in that regard by those two reports.That is what we are doing.  We should get on with it and not decry the fact we are dealing with two issues in one piece of legislation.  There is a clear overlap in that the redress scheme for cohabitants refers not only to opposite sex couples but to same sex couples.

There has been a major lobby by all the churches, from bishops to ordinary members and many others, who asked that this exemption be considered.  I may be the only Deputy who got this material but I assure the House I got it from Catholic bishops, Church of Ireland, Baptist and Presbyterian ministers, and many individuals throughout the country.  I make no apology of any kind for raising the matter on their behalf.  It is not only the registrar issue that worries them but other situations about which many people have been very vocal.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	579	Were they made by registrars?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	580	There has been substantial lobbying although not by registrars.  As they are State officials, it would be highly unusual if registrars were to make representations, as alleged.  However, to say there has not been lobbying or that representations were not made would be doing the people concerned a disservice.  Many of them are genuine in their belief that an appropriate amendment to protect freedom of conscience and religion might be incorporated in the legislation.The Minister is right.  I did not table such an amendment, nor did anybody on any side of the House.  However, I hope the Minister does not insinuate that because the Opposition did not table an amendment the matter was not worthy of consideration or that it did not form the basis of strong representations from various groups and individuals from different backgrounds and religious persuasions, as testified by Deputy Crawford.At this late stage in the debate, I ask the Minister to reaffirm his view and that of the Attorney General, the Government and the majority parties in this House that there is no scope for the type of amendment sought, notwithstanding a genuine belief on the part of individuals that complying with this legislation will present them with a conflict.  I do not refer specifically to registrars but also, for example, to the use of institutional property.  That is not the issue raised by Deputy Howlin on Committee Stage when he referred to florists and the provision of goods and services, which clearly cannot be accommodated.  However, there may be an issue where sacred church property is concerned, the use of which is confined to the furtherance of religion.  This is property that has not benefited in any way from any form of State funding and has no public State functions other than the narrow confines of furtherance of a certain religious view.If the Minister can tell me he is satisfied that the use of such property may be preserved or that there are circumstances where the use of such property might be preserved, then I will be happy.  However, to suggest that because I did not table an amendment that this was not an issue does this debate a disservice.  I did not do so because I believed the two elements to the amendment sought, in respect of issues for individuals and those for institutions, were such that we would, in effect, unravel a very important corpus of legislation which, over many years, we have put through the House as an anti-discrimination code.  I believed that was not compatible with the type of amendments sought or the lobbying, with which Deputy O'Rourke does not appear to have had any engagement.

Many of my party's backbenchers contacted me about this issue, many of whom hold very genuine views on it.

It is important that no doubt be left on this issue.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I certainly will, but I am afraid a Pandora's box has been opened that we had already dealt with in great detail on Second and Committee Stages.  It cannot rest with people ambling in now who clearly do not understand exactly what is in the Bill.The Bill that I brought twice before this House, namely, the civil unions Bill 2006, did create a marriage-like institution.  In that Bill, I allowed for an opt-out clause to provide for the right of religious people to opt out from it.  However, this is quite different.  The Minister's proposal is for a civil partnership, which can only be presided over by registrars of the State.  It is quite wrong to allow anybody who is a functionary of the State to opt out from carrying out a duty that is determined by this House.  Where does that end?  Deputy Crawford in particular should know.  If somebody decided that he or she would not deal with people of a certain religion, how would we react in this House?  How would we react in this House if registrars decided that they would not allow people who are divorced to remarry, even though that is the law of the land?  Let us not make a narrow set of rules for one class of people in this House.  That is the consensus we had.Deputy Flanagan presented a very narrow construction on this.  The lobbying was not about a narrow construction because those involved wanted blanket exemptions.  They mentioned service providers such as florists and others in the representations we received.  I absolutely reject that.  Since the Equal Status Act 2000, it is unlawful to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation in the provision of services.  The Minister's provisions do nothing to upset that, nor should they.  I do not know of too many florists or providers of services of any description who would not be very happy with the business right now.

I do not think that gay couples would want to do that.  I do not think they want to go to places where there is antipathy towards them, if that is public and manifest.  It is unfortunate that such antipathy would exist, but I think people want to have these civil ceremonies in a place full of joy that is appropriate to the ceremony they are celebrating.People who are fundamentally opposed to the principles of civil partnerships of same sex couples have thrown red herrings into this argument, and we have dealt with those.  However, I fully accept Deputy Crawford's bona fides on this.  There are people, many of them lobbyists and many of them outside the House over the last few days, whose views are fundamentalist but to which they are entitled.  I do not believe their views reflect the overwhelming view of modern Ireland and the people of this State right now.

That is my duty as a public representative.I understand what is in the Bill.  I am still concerned about the two years versus the four years and I am not happy with the Minister's reply that one can seek court redress after two years.  If the two years and four to five years clauses remain in the Bill, then in my opinion that would be an incentive to people getting married.  In the circumstances where a couple have cohabited for the qualifying period, the financially dependent party may, with the prospect of marriage, be left in an economically less advantageous position.  How is that not discrimination against married couples if unmarried couples cohabiting together with children can have redress after two years while married couples who have been living apart cannot have redress for four to five years?  If the Minister can satisfy me on that, I might not have any more to contribute to this debate.

Perhaps it is no harm that we get all these things out of the way, because we have a relatively small amount of time.  It reminds me a bit of the Bill on stag hunting, when there was much debate about things that were not in the Bill.  Exactly the same happened during the debate on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009, which we enacted this time last year.  Many people, including some learned senior counsel, went on the radio who clearly had not read the Bill and spoke about things that were not even in it.  We have had an element of that during the lobbying for this Bill.Deputy O'Rourke made a point about freedom of conscience.  People were making representations.  The registrars have not said anything to us.  In fact, if there was anything said, it was positive as they did not ask for any exemption themselves.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	592	Their union supported it.

I listed out a number of possibilities.When we pass laws in the State, we expect our public servants to implement those laws to the letter without fear or favour under the Constitution.  If there were people who decided that they were going to opt out of this and not enforce what we pass in the Oireachtas, it would leave the taxpayer open to a huge claim for non-implementation of the law that applied to them and to which they were entitled.  We live in a society composed of people of all different faiths and ethnicities.  When I was Minister for Foreign Affairs, I was intrigued to see that there are 177 nations in the UN, and we have people from 169 nations resident in this State.  Virtually every nation is represented in this State.Up until now, a registrar could refuse on religious grounds to process divorce proceedings.  Divorce is not recognised by at least one church, yet no registrar has not performed his or her duty, even though I assume some registrars are of that religion.  A court clerk might refuse to issue divorce orders because of a religious belief.  A fundamentalist Christian Garda might refuse to arrest a person who is breaching a safety order on the basis that the husband is entitled to chastise his wife.  A judge might refuse to register a power of attorney in favour of a person's civil partner.  A Muslim or a Mormon accident and emergency doctor might refuse to treat someone with alcohol poisoning.  A social welfare official might refuse to pay a carer's allowance to a person's civil partner.  A probate officer might refuse to issue a grant of administration to a deceased person's civil partner.  Where are we going to end with all of this?From a policy point of view, there was no way in which we could allow freedom of conscience in this regard.With regard to what is in the Bill and what is not in it in terms of the use of church property, photographers, florists and so on, that is all dictated by the Equal Status Act 2000 and the Equal Status Act 2004 and, therefore, already provided for.  This Bill will not do any more or any less.  It will not destroy anyone's rights.  It will give those people who have been deprived of those rights, civil rights and legal protection into the future.Deputy Howlin referred to the issue of exemption.  Section 5(2)(e) of the Equal Status Act 2000, as amended, exempts from its scope differences in the treatment of persons on the religion ground in relation to goods and services provided for a religious purpose.  I refer Deputy Flanagan to section 59E, on page 23 of this Bill, which states, “A civil partnership may be registered only at a place and time chosen by the parties to the civil partnership with the agreement of the registrar and, if the place chosen is not the office of a registrar, the approval of the place by the Executive, [that is the HSE] and the question whether to give or withhold the approval, shall be determined by the Executive by reference to the matters that the Minister may specify”.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	595	In effect, that means that no church can be forced to have a ceremony on its sacred ground, its church property, which is used for religious purposes.  The only way a church could be used is if the church applied to be registered and applied for approval by the HSE under the legislation.  Anybody who suggests that gay couples will now take churches to court for the use of the church is a complete nonsense.  That is not included in the legislation.  It is stated in black and white in the legislation that that can be done only at the instigation of the church if a place is to be used for a civil ceremony by a gay couple.If there is other property owned by the church and it rents it out for commercial purposes, it could be forced to allow that property to be used.  That is not provided for under this legislation but in legislation passed ten years ago, the Equal Status Act 2000.  If a church rents out its property, it is not entitled to discriminate.  That are nine protected statuses in earlier legislation, one of which is sex, religion etc.We need to deal with what is in the legislation and not with what is not in it.  To return to the central point of the amendments, I accept the point made by Deputy Flanagan now and by Deputy Howlin on Committee Stage that the Title of the Bill does not reflect the fact that there are two distinct issues involved, and we have amended that accordingly.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I thank the Minister for the clarification.  Notwithstanding the genuine point made by Deputy Howlin that debate has been somewhat more rambling than the point to which the amendment refers, it was important.  We debated this matter on Committee Stage, but I thought there were still doubts as to the position, and I pleased the Minister has done no more than put on record his agreement with a point that I felt was important in the context of the current position.  That is the reason there was not an amendment on my part.The registrars already have statutory functions, which require them to solemnise and register the marriages of previously divorced people and there does not appear to have been any problem with freedom of conscience or an opt-out clause.  I strongly believe it would be contrary to public policy to allow for a situation where any of the nine protected grounds in existing equality law could have a loophole or a softening of the situation such as to allow what would be nothing short of discrimination.  I am pleased the Minister has once again clarified the matter for the benefit of people who may not have been following the debate as closely as Deputy Howlin or other colleagues.One of the faults of the current legislative regimes is that, given the number of committees and Committee Stage debates of Bills dealt with in the bowels of the House, in the absence of the media or adequate reporting of the debates,  it often gives the impression that we are not engaged in the teasing out of the legislation or the debate.  I make no apologies for asking the Minister to give the type of clarification that I sought and expected, and I thank him for so doing.

Thirty speakers contributed to the debate on Second Stage in this Chamber.  There was a significant debate on this Bill in Committee, at which some members of the media were present, albeit from one or perhaps two newspapers, and RTE and others may have been following the debate.  Therefore, it is not our fault that this Bill was not widely discussed by the public.I advise Deputy McCormack that the cohabitation scheme is for non-marital, heterosexual and same sex couples.  It kicks in after a period of five years if there are no children and two years if there are children.

We tabled an amendment on Committee Stage raising the period from three years to five years.  In the case of a married couple, existing legislation provides that if the marriage breaks down immediately, there is an entitlement immediately for one partner to apply to the other for maintenance.  If the marriage breaks down immediately, there is no period before the scheme kicks in.  This is not discriminating against——

In page 13, to delete lines 14 to 22 and substitute the following:"(2) This Act shall come into operation on the day that is 3 months after the passing of this Act.".I will not labour this point as I made it on Committee Stage.  I reaffirm my view that having clarity regarding the commencement of the Act is important.  We have engaged in the passing of legislation in this House in the past which subsequently gave rise to some confusion.  If commencement orders in respect of certain Parts of the Bill are immediately triggered and others take one month or more to be triggered, I am not sure if it is in the best interests of legislation that certain Parts of a Bill come into force at different times.  It is preferable that we would have a commencement order to the effect that an Act would come into force on a particular day in its entirety.  The Family Law (Divorce) Act, for example, is similar to that which we are debating now.  If we had a lead-in time towards a specific date, it would give people an opportunity to become organised and familiar with the terms and conditions, particularly as we felt the need to change the Title of the Bill to include reference to cohabitants.There is a view that there has not been the type of national publicity campaign that is both appropriate and necessary to ensure citizens and others living in Ireland are familiar with the broad-ranging consequences of the Bill.  I am not fixed on a timeframe of three months; if the Minister were to specify that it will be done within four, five, six months or whatever, that would be fine.  What is important is that the implementation of this legislation is not done in a piecemeal way.  I ask the Minister to take on board my proposal that the Bill come into operation in its entirety on a specified date.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I said on Committee Stage that it is a normal feature of most legislation that there is flexibility for the Minister to commence all or part of the Bill as appropriate.  The Minister indicated during the committee deliberations that he had given a commitment both inside the House and elsewhere to commence this Bill as soon as possible.  Thousands of citizens are interested in its progress and wish to avail of its provisions as quickly as possible.  Some, as I have indicated, may not be in the best of health and wish to regularise their arrangements, which may have been in place for many years, while they are still able to do so.  There is an imperative on this House to conclude its deliberations on this matter, and on the Minister to make the appropriate commencement orders as soon as is practicable.The Minister indicated that two other Departments, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection, are working in tandem on drawing up taxation measures and social welfare provisions to mirror the new regime.  I understand from the Minister's Committee Stage contribution that they are doing so on the basis of the Bill as published.  Will the Minister indicate what progress those two Departments have made?  We must have an assurance that once the Oireachtas has completed its deliberation and the Bill is sent to the President for signature, there will be no further delays arising from the inaction of other Departments in bringing the relevant provisions into effect.

I am not sure whether three months allows for the full passage of the legislation, but perhaps the Minister will indicate what impediments may arise to prevent its implementation within that timeframe.  I assume the preparatory work has been done at this stage given that the passage of the Bill is well signalled and the relevant Departments are well aware of its provisions.  I hope no delay will arise because of a failure of another Departments to undertake the preparatory work necessary to give full effect to the Bill within the three-month timeframe proposed by Deputy Charles Flanagan in amendment No. 3 or, at the very latest, by the end of the year.  There is no reason that a delay beyond that should occur.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Neither I nor the Government wish to pass legislation that is subject to a time limit within which it may not be possible to deliver the benefits that flow from this Bill in regard to social welfare and taxation provision.  Both the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection have been working on the template for what is required.  I understand the work of the Department of Social Protection is well advanced and that it expects to bring forward legislation in the autumn to implement the Bill's provision.  The issue of taxation changes is a matter for the next Finance Bill.Imposing a specific time limit on the commencement of this legislation is impractical in that we may well end up commencing a Bill that is not implementable because the corresponding legislation is not in place.  There must be flexibility in regard to commencement.  There is no desire to delay this in any way; we are not putting the social welfare and taxation issues on the long finger.  There are two distinct issues involved here, namely, civil partnership and cohabitation.  In respect of both — civil partnership, in particular — I am advised that a significant publicity campaign is required to ensure the public is aware of all aspects including, for example, the cohabitant redress scheme.  Before the Bill is commenced we must ensure that existing and future couples know this legislation is on the Statute Book and what it contains.

In page 14, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:"3.—For the purposes of this Act, a reference to the presence of any person in the State or co-habitation in the State shall include presence or co-habitation while abroad in the service of the State.".I have had direct contact with officers of the State who are working on missions abroad, including members of the diplomatic corps and military personnel posted abroad, to whom these provisions should apply.  These are real people in real circumstances.  They have indicated to me their concern that they may not be able to meet the requirements of the legislation by virtue of their obligation as part of their duties to have a residence abroad.  We allow such personnel to participate fully in our democratic process because they are fully part of the State.  Their domicile, although physically in another jurisdiction, remains in this State.  Their allegiance is to the State, they are servants of the State and, as such, they should be entitled to avail of the provisions of this important enactment.  It may have been an oversight that we did not include this provision earlier.  I hope the Minister will respect those who serve the State on foreign missions by ensuring they are encompassed within and embraced by the provisions of this legislation.

Accordingly, the amendment simply has no effect.  Persons working abroad in the service of the State are likely to retain their domicile for the purposes of the Bill.  Anybody working for the State abroad does not normally change his or her domicile, which is very difficult to do in any case.  Staff on a foreign mission on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs, for example, would be regarded under this legislation as being domiciled in the State even though they are living and working abroad.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I do not understand the first point made by the Minister.  My amendment simply proposes to insert a new definition in the definitions section.The word "presence", which occurs throughout the Bill, is to be interpreted in the way I have indicated in this definition.  That is the purpose of the amendment, so I have no idea what the Minister means when he says it has no effect.  For the purpose of the Act, the reference to the presence of any person in the State, or cohabitation in the State, shall include a presence or cohabitation abroad in the service of the State.  It is amendment to the interpretation section, I want to reinterpret the world "presence" as it occurs in the Bill.We can have a further debate regarding "domicile", as we did on Committee Stage on a different point, where I was concerned about the requirement for a one year domicile in the State for certain provisions.  The Minister was strongly of the view that domicile is a hard thing to lose.  I have taken advice on this and I am not sure the Minister is correct.  There are people whose domicile might be outside the State who would be precluded from taking advantage of the provisions of this enactment.  I do not see how it does a disservice to the Minister — I welcome his commitment that officers of the State will be included in this while serving abroad and that their service abroad will not affect their entitlement to the provisions of this Act.  There are, however, people whose formal domicile is abroad, and they can be abroad for many years in the service of the State, on double tours for instance.  If the Minister agrees with me these people should be covered by the legislation, why do we not say so specifically?

The legislation states that the court can only make an order if one of the civil partners is domiciled in the State on the date of the application.  Someone who has just temporarily changed his residence on behalf of the State working in a mission abroad who wants to apply under this legislation would not be regarded as having been domiciled in that foreign territory because their domicile of origin would be in Ireland.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	618	That would be the norm but not necessarily universal.

I refer the Deputy to the Supreme Court judgment in 2003 of T v. L, relating to the foreign divorce of a married couple who had emigrated to the Netherlands in 1988.  The court concurred with the prior finding of the High Court that their Dutch divorce, obtained in 1994, was not recognised in Ireland on the basis that the husband’s domicile was still in Ireland.  In that judgment, Mr. Justice Keane remarked: “Evidence as to the form of residence in a foreign country so dependent on the particular personal circumstances of the person alleged to have been abandoned, a domicile of origin is very far removed from evidence of a fixed intention to make one’s permanent home in a foreign country, which the authorities stipulate as the essential precondition to finding that a domicile of origin has been abandoned and a domicile of choice acquired.”  Unless there is a purposeful act of change of domicile, this legislation will apply to existing representatives working for the State abroad.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The way we do business in the House is sometimes frustrating.  I accept the case the Minister is making will capture most cases.  There will, however, be an exception where someone will be excluded because the domicile is not clear.  It does no disservice to accept this amendment.  In most legislation, the starting premise of Departments is to find the argument against it, and there is an argument against everything, but if this does no harm and meets the requirements of the House to ensure this is done, I cannot see why the amendment cannot be accepted.  Clearly the Minister thinks it is redundant but that also means it is not of any injury while in my view it makes it clear that we are including foreign service officers or personnel serving abroad with the military or long-term servants of the State who are out of the jurisdiction and whose domicile may, for a prolonged period of time, not be of the State.The Minister, however, is not minded to be flexible on the matter and there are significant other issues to address.

There will be a case, however, where domicile will be an issue and this might help.  That is why I would have liked the Minister to accept the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 14, to delete lines 31 to 33 and substitute the following:"(ii) prior to the death had ever been ordinarily resident in the State for a period of one year.".This amendment gets to the meat of the Bill.  Section 4(2) of the Bill addresses the declaration of civil partnership status.  It reads:The court may only make an order under subsection (1) if one of the civil partners—(a) is domiciled in the State on the date of the application,(b) has been ordinarily resident in the State throughout the period of one year immediately preceding the date of the application, or(c) died before the date of the application and—(i) was at the time of death domiciled in the State, or 30(ii) had been ordinarily resident in the State throughout the period of one year immediately preceding the date of death.We debated this on Committee Stage because I felt that is a very narrow definition, that it had to be that calendar year, the calendar year immediately preceding the date of death, the person had to be resident in the State.  In my amendment, there is a better, more open and encompassing suggestion that "prior to the death had ever been ordinarily resident in the State for a period of one year".  The Minister thought that was too loose.  I agreed that it was somewhat loose but I tabled it again because the Minister's definition is too narrow and he indicated he would think about this again.His argument against my proposal was that it would create too loose or distant a connection to the State.  I was perplexed on Committee Stage why one calendar year, that preceding death, was not a bit loose but any other 12 month period was.  I did not get an explanation from the Minister about why it had to be that particular 12 months.  Perhaps the formulation I have used is not ideal but the Minister's formulation is not ideal either and I had hoped he would come back on Report Stage with a loosening of this requirement.  It might affect people who could not strictly comply with the requirements of section 4(2)(c) as indicated.  I would be interested to hear if the Minister has reflected on this and if he proposes to introduce any further amendments, perhaps in the other House.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	624	We had an intense discussion on this issue and we looked at it again.  I still feel that deleting this would negate the necessity of the person having some connection with the State.  This refers to declarations as to civil partnerships and we think it will be used only in very rare circumstances because if, after the passage of the Bill, a person enters into a civil partnership here then she or he will be always entitled to be treated as a civil partner unless and until that partnership is dissolved.  Likewise, if a person has entered into a civil partnership elsewhere and both of the couple are alive on the date the relevant order recognising that relationship comes into effect, he or she will be always entitled to be treated as a civil partner for the purposes of Irish law unless that civil partnership is dissolved.  This includes all of the relevant rights and obligations which accrue under civil partnership including succession, pensions and shared home protection.  The situations in which a declaration as to the status — this is to what the section refers — may be required are, for example, where a relationship entered into in another state was dissolved and there is a question about the validity of that dissolution and whether it took place in the same state or another, or perhaps where a civil partnership entered into in this jurisdiction was purported to be dissolved in another state after the couple concerned had moved their permanent domicile elsewhere.  This may have implications for whether the civil partner is free to enter a new civil relationship or whether the person has certain succession rights.In a case where the relevant person does not have a direct or continuing connection with the State it is simply not appropriate to confer jurisdiction on our courts to deal with such matters.  The jurisdiction we will confer on courts here in this respect is directly comparable with the jurisdiction on marital status already provided.  This is based on clear and well-understood principles of jurisdiction and international private law.  The reference to the year is to ensure there is a connection with the State before the declaration can be made.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I fully accept there should be such a connection.  The narrowness of the definition of the connection, that it must be the particular 12 months immediately preceding the date of death, is a trip-wire that will trip up some people.  The Minister is probably right that the number of cases will not be huge but it is a trip-wire that we need not include.  We need a looser definition.  All we are talking about is enabling the courts to make an order.  The courts will act in a just fashion but this will place a barrier to their ability to do so.  Section 4(2) states that the court may only make an order under section 4(1) if the conditions in section 4(2) apply.  Even if the court is convinced of the justice of the matter, feels there is a case to be met and that justice requires such an order, if the technical requirement that one of the parties had not been ordinarily resident in the State throughout the period of one year immediately preceding the date of death is not complied with, it is an impediment to the court acting.As the Minister rightly stated, it is simply a formulation to define connection.  If we loosen it somewhat all it will do is allow somebody to make a case in court and nothing more.  The courts will act in a just way as is their wont.  Perhaps the formula of words I used is too loose.  Perhaps I should have done my homework better during the gap between Committee Stage and now but I had hoped, with the commitment given by the Minister, that he might have come up with an amendment to broaden his formulation somewhat.

The legislation is being rushed through and it is a very complicated area to get right.  By rushing it through we could end up with lame duck legislation.  The provisions on financial dependency will not necessarily ensure that the vulnerable party is protected when and if the relationship breaks down.  I have issues with this.  It is being rushed, which I stated with regard to other legislation earlier in the week.

There was significant debate on Second and Committee Stages and we are now on Report Stage.To respond to Deputy Howlin on section 4 to which the amendment relates, under section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 the same provisions are in place on declarations with regard to married couples.  This is a standard mirror image of what is already in existing law with regard to marital status.  I do not feel we should depart from something that is already in law and probably has been tested in court.

In page 15, line 24, to delete "may" and substitute "shall, on the commencement of this Act".I was hoping the Minister would have examined since Committee Stage the matter of recognition of registered foreign relationships.  The Bill, as drafted, states the Minister may, by order, declare that a class of legal relationship entered into by two parties of the same sex is entitled to be recognised as a civil partnership under the law of the jurisdiction in which the legal relationship was entered into if various criteria included in the Bill are met.  If the Minister may do it, then the Minister may not do it and I have a problem with that.  If the Minister may not do it there is an element of uncertainty.  It is important that the Minister immediately declare the class of relationships currently entitled to recognition and, at the same time as we complete the Bill, lay an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Many gay couples have registered or married abroad and they need immediate clarity on the status of their relationships and their recognition in this jurisdiction.  It is incumbent on the Minister to declare the various classes to which recognition will be forthcoming rather than having a situation which, under the current reading, is less than certain.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	640	My amendments differ from those tabled by Deputy Flanagan.  Amendment No. 9 states, "including a relationship entered into prior to the commencement of this section".  Section 5 states, "The Minister may, by order, declare that a class of legal relationship entered into by two parties of the same sex is entitled to be recognised as a civil partnership if under the law of the jurisdiction in which the legal relationship was entered into" it fulfilled a number of criteria.  We should add to that the term, "a relationship entered into prior to the commencement of this section".  We are starting at ground zero on this.  There needs to be clarity in respect of relationships which have been solemnised and voluntarily entered into in other jurisdictions before the commencement of this section.Clearly, Irish gay couples could not enter into a civil partnership relationship in this jurisdiction up to now and will not until this provision is enacted.  We need to give clarity to such couples on the recognition of relationships that have been solemnised in other jurisdictions before the commencement of this section.  There should be no doubt or ambiguity in that regard and the insertion of my amendment would meet that need.  Amendment No. 10 states:In page 15, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:"(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), where—(a) one of the persons in the civil partnership dies before the commencement of this section and before a declaration that a civil partnership of that class is entitled to be recognised,(b) the foreign civil partnership was entered into after 1 January 2004,(c) the foreign civil partnership was between persons both or either of whom were or was citizens or a citizen of Ireland, or residents or a resident of Ireland, on the day of the registered foreign relationships,then the foreign relationships to which this section applies shall be and shall be deemed always to have been valid as to form if it would have been so valid had it been registered in the State.(4) An tArd-Chláraitheoir may, on production of such evidence as appears to him to be satisfactory, cause a registered foreign relationship to which this section applies to be registered in a register to be maintained in Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheoir.".We discussed this issue on Committee Stage.  This is important.  A number of couples have entered into foreign relationships, in particular since civil partnership became legal in Northern Ireland, and there should be clarity in regard to carrying that through into the Republic.The Minister, I recall, gave a commitment to reflect further on this.  He said he would revert to me on it but he believed the amendment was not necessary.  However, he said he would reflect further and take further legal advice, which I hope he has done.  I read again what the Minister said on Committee Stage regarding these matters.  We have no difficulty in terms of the objective of the amendment.  The Minister feels it is unnecessary and I would like to hear his comments on whether he has thought about it or has received further advice from the Attorney General on this matter since we last debated it.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	641	We are dealing with amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive.  For the purposes of clarity and record I will set out the rationale in order that our position on each of the amendments is understood.  Section 5, to which the amendment relates, provides that the Minister may make an order recognising certain categories of foreign legal relationships as entitled to the same treatment as a civil partnership under Irish law.Amendment No. 8 tabled by Deputy Flanagan would have the effect that such an order made under section 5 could be made only once on the commencement of the Act.  This would only allow us to recognise new categories of relationship as equivalent to civil partnerships which were established by other countries after the commencement of the Act.  I reiterate that given that the law internationally on the recognition of same sex relationships is evolving, it is essential that we have the flexibility to make orders on an ongoing basis to reflect these changes.  The manner in which the amendment is phrased would mean that the Minister shall, on the commencement of the Act, that is, once and only once, be able to make orders.  We would not be able to make any further orders to take into account the changing international legal environment.On the questions of "shall" versus "may", in some cases time may be required to examine the nature of the category of a relationship from another jurisdiction to determine whether it meets the criteria in subsection(1)(a) to (d), inclusive, for recognition here as a civil partnership.  A mandatory requirement that the Minister make an order may expose the State to damages purely for the reason that a given class of relationship is not immediately recognised because careful examination is required or simply because information is not readily available in one of the national languages.  I assure the Deputy that given the degree of cross-party support for this Bill and its benefits for same sex couples there is little likelihood of the scenario of a Minister not being prepared to make a relevant order at the appropriate time.On amendment No. 9, tabled by Deputy Howlin, as I indicated on Committee Stage a relationship entered into prior to the making of an order under section 5 is also recognised by that order.  The wording of section 5 makes this abundantly clear.  A relevant relationship is recognised from the later of the dates on which the order took effect or on the date on which the relationship was entered into.  If, for example, a couple entered a civil partnership in the United Kingdom in 2006, their relationship would be recognised as and from the date on which the relevant order takes effect.  If a couple entered a same sex marriage in Spain in 2012, a relevant order having been made in 2011, their relationship would be recognised as and from the date of their marriage.  My officials and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel considered this issue carefully before drafting the Bill.  Following the debate on Committee Stage we again received confirmation from the Office of the Attorney General that it believed our interpretation is correct and is the only one possible in this respect.Amendment No. 10, tabled by Deputy Howlin, would allow the recognition of a foreign civil partnership where one of the partners dies before the section is commenced and possibly before the commencement of the Bill.  The effect would be to give recognition of a foreign registered civil partnership entered into, for example, in 2006, where one of the partners died in, for example, 2008 when civil partnership was not recognised in this State.  This would introduce grave uncertainty for the tax code and succession law.  As I explained during our extensive discussion on this point on Committee Stage, it is not acceptable to provide for retrospective recognition of foreign civil partnerships where there is a potential detriment to third parties, for example, by improving the share of the surviving partner in the deceased partner's estate.The Deputy argued that the Marriage Act 1972 provides a direct precedence to allow for retrospective recognition.  I do not accept this.  There is a substantive difference between an opposite sex couple who marry in another jurisdiction with the belief that the marriage is internationally recognised and binding and that of a couple who entered a civil partnership elsewhere in the full knowledge that no provision is made in Irish law for the recognition of that relationship.  In the first case, the couple assume and have always assumed that they are married for the purpose of Irish law, with all its obligations and rights.  In the latter, the couple can have no assumptions in regard to the rights and benefits which accrue to them under Irish law.  The amendment would also have a discriminatory effect on the basis of nationality.  Some, out of a particular category of legal relationships where a partner has died, would be recognised as existing at a particular time whereas others would not, depending on whether one or both partners was Irish or resident in Ireland at the time the relationship was registered.  A further anomaly would arise simply if a couple registered their relationship before the arbitrary cut-off point of 1 January 2004.On Committee Stage we also discussed the proposed new subsection (4), which would create a new function for an tArd-Chláraitheoir by enabling him or her to register relationships entered into in another jurisdiction as civil partnerships.  I stated during that discussion that the making of a ministerial order under section 5(1) is in itself sufficient to entitle parties to foreign registered relationships to be treated as civil partners of each other under the law of this State.  There is no requirement for re-registration.  Opposite sex couples who marry in other jurisdictions are neither required nor permitted to re-register their marriages under Irish law and there is no reason couples who are entitled to be treated as civil partners should do so either.

In page 15, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:"(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), where -(a) one of the persons in the civil partnership dies before the commencement of this section and before a declaration that a civil partnership of that class is entitled to be recognised,(b) the foreign civil partnership was entered into after 1 January 2004,(c) the foreign civil partnership was between persons both or either of whom were or was citizens or a citizen of Ireland, or residents or a resident of Ireland, on the day of the registered foreign relationships, then the foreign relationships to which this section applies shall be and shall be deemed always to have been valid as to form if it would have been so valid had it been registered in the State.(4) An tArd-Chláraitheoir may, on production of such evidence as appears to him to be satisfactory, cause a registered foreign relationship to which this section applies to be registered in a register to be maintained in Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheoir.".I referred earlier to the Marriages Act 1972.  As legislators, we often shape the law to suit our needs.  Beginning in 1953, genuine couples went to Lourdes to attend religious ceremonies and receive a form of blessing.  As they presumed themselves to be married, the State decided in 1972 to retrospectively validate their relationships as if they had been genuine Irish marriages from the beginning.  Between 1953 and 1972, some of the individuals concerned died and the arrangement of their affairs on the basis of marriage was retrospectively validated.  It is amazing what can be done when there is a will.

I mention the Act as a legal precedent but I am not further minded to fight the Minister on the amendment.  I recognise that difficulties might arise in the formula I used but I am concerned about circumstances where one of the parties to a civil partnership dies before the commencement of this section.  I accept the Minister's word that the prospect of this has been properly addressed and that an tArd-Chláraitheoir is in a position to register relationships entered into abroad.  This would be more secure legally than the religious blessings validated by the 1972 Act.

In page 21, line 44, to delete "shall make" and substitute "shall orally make".On Committee Stage I signalled my intention to move these amendments.  Amendment No. 11 provides that intending civil partners must make their declarations orally.  An tArd-Chláraitheoir advises this is essential so that the registrar can be satisfied that the partners understand the nature of the civil partnership.A registrar must be also satisfied under section 59D(2) of the Civil Registration Act, as inserted by this Bill.  Amendment No. 12 is consequential to Amendment No. 11, which provides that it is mandatory to make declarations orally in the provision of civil partnership ceremonies under section 59D(5).  It is no longer necessary to specify that the declarations may be made orally and accordingly Amendment No. 12 deletes the word "orally".

In page 22, to delete lines 33 to 40 and substitute the following:"(6) (a) The witnesses shall sign the form after the parties to the civil partnership have done so, and the registrar shall countersign the form.(b) The parties’ civil partnership shall be taken to be registered upon the counter-signature of the registrar.(c) As soon as practicable after the signatures and counter-signature, the registrar shall give the parties a copy of the form referred to in paragraph (a), enter the particulars in relation to the civil partnership in the register and register the civil partnership in a manner that an tArd-Chláraitheoir may direct.”.This amendment redrafts section 59D(6).  New subsection (6)(a) replicates exactly part of the original provision.  New subsection (6)(b) ensures that a civil partnership is taken to be registered from the moment the registrar countersigns the couple’s witnessed civil partnership registration form.  The Bill refers extensively to civil partnership registration and the rights and duties that accrue therefrom but it is essential to be clear that such rights and duties take effect on the completion of formalities by the countersigning of the registration form by the registrar.  New subsection (6)(c) adds a requirement on the registrar to provide a copy of the signed civil partnership form to the parties.

In page 26, lines 48 to 50, to delete "consultant psychiatrist within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Mental Health Act 2001" and substitute "registered medical practitioner".The purpose of this amendment is to provide that an objection on the grounds of incapacity of one of the parties to consent to an intended civil partnership must be accompanied by a certificate made by a registered medical practitioner rather than a consultant psychiatrist.  I am proposing this change on the advice of an tArd-Chláraitheoir.This amendment mirrors the position in respect of marriage.  The certificate of a registered medical practitioner is sufficient to support an objection to a marriage on the grounds that one of the parties lacks the capacity to give full, free and informed consent.  An tArd-Chláraitheoir has pointed out that the three-month notice period prior to registration of a civil partnership may not allow sufficient time for a party whose capacities is in doubt to be examined by a consultant psychiatrist.  The opinion of a medical practitioner who knows the person concerned is considered to be sufficient to support an objection in the case of marriage.

Such claims could be aided and abetted by family doctors.  I acknowledge this may be just a conspiracy theory.Even in the case of marriage, having only one doctor provide a certificate supporting an objection is risky.  A second opinion, even one from a doctor known to the first doctor, would be desirable.In that context, has the Minister considered the ramifications of spurious objections being made?  Are there plans to revisit this issue, including from the perspective of marriage?  That a family doctor or a doctor who is friendly with a relative can sign off on a person's mental capacity or ability to give consent carries a certain risk both in the case of same sex and opposite sex civil unions and in the case of marriage.  Are there plans to ring-fence this issue in future by introducing a requirement that two doctors sign such a certificate?

While I understand the point Deputy Gogarty makes, his express wish is that civil partnership should be as close to marriage as possible.  The form of objections that may be made to the partnership and its registration is one of the areas in which the legislation's provisions equate to those in place for marriage.  The experience has been that such objections are rarely raised, at least in relation to marriages, and I hazard a guess they will also be rare in the case of civil partnerships.  If anyone has an objection, it must not be frivolous because it may not be included unless the person objecting obtains a certificate from a registered general practitioner who knows the person involved.

I do not know if the Minister has taken advice on this matter but the problem in such cases is that it is difficult to find out how such interventions can be undone.  Counsel for the couple whose marriage was stopped has applied to the Garda and registrar for clarity.  The former has indicated it no longer has an objection to the marriage taking place, while the latter will not proceed.  I wonder about the process involved and whether it is an issue, in general terms, that we may need to revisit.

In page 27, to delete lines 1 to 37, and substitute the following:"59G.—If a party or a witness to a civil partnership registration does not have sufficient knowledge of the language of the registration to understand the registration documents or the declarations, the parties shall have an interpreter present who shall—(a) before the parties make the declarations, sign, in the presence of the registrar, a statement to the effect that the interpreter understands and is able to converse in the language in respect of which he or she is to act as interpreter and give the statement to the registrar, and(b) immediately after those declarations are made, give the registrar a signed certificate written in the language of the registration, to the effect that the interpreter has faithfully acted as interpreter.59H.—The parties to a registered civil partnership shall be taken to be civil partners of each other as soon as the registrar has countersigned the civil partnership form as required by section 59D(6)(a), regardless of whether the registrar has performed the actions required of him or her under section 59D(6)(c), and all duties and benefits that accrue to civil partners under the Act of 2010 or any other law accrue to them.”.Amendment No. 14 substitutes sections 59G and 59H.  The substitution of section 59G is related to amendment No. 11, making it mandatory for declarations to be made orally.  Amendment No. 15 provides that interpretation is required if either of the parties or their witnesses do not understand the language in which the declarations are made.  It removes provision for the translation of documents which will no longer be required since interpretation will be an absolute requirement where any party does not understand the language of the declarations.The redraft of section 59H is related to the changes made in amendment No. 13.  It ensures the parties are taken to be registered civil partners and entitled to all its benefits and subject to all its obligations after they have made their oral declarations and the civil partnership registration form has been signed, witnessed and countersigned.  The section specifies that a couple are civil partners regardless of whether the registrar has entered their details into the civil partnership register.  The acquisition of rights and duties is not contingent on the formal entry into the civil partnership register to be maintained by the General Register Office.  It is important to clarify this matter as the entry into the registrar may take place some time after the declarations are made and the form signed.

It differs from Deputy Flanagan's amendment in one key respect, namely, it does not specify that such transactions shall be exempt from stamp duty.  This has attracted some commentary in recent weeks.  I make absolutely clear that the reason the section does not deal with stamp duty is that all tax consequences of civil partnership will be dealt with in the next finance Bill following the enactment of the Civil Partnership Bill.  Government policy is that civil partners will be treated in exactly the same way as spouses under the taxation and social welfare codes.  The matter will be addressed in the Finance Bill.

This issue arose on Committee Stage and I am pleased he has taken on board a suggestion made in that debate.  The only difference between the Minister's amendment and my amendment is in the matter of stamp duty.  I am disappointed that express mention of stamp duty is not made in the amendment.  My amendment makes clear that stamp duty would not be paid on the creation of a joint tenancy in the family home exemption.  This would conform precisely with section 14 of the Family Home Protection Act 1976.The Minister has indicated that while he does not propose to expressly include in the Bill the term "No stamp duty", which features in my amendment, stamp duty will not be paid, having regard to the taxation policy to which he adverted.  Assuming that is the case, I am prepared not to move amendment No. 17.

The matters were taxation, social welfare and health-children provisions.  I would have preferred if the issue of children had been addressed in this measure but this was not done and no such provisions are before us.I accepted from the beginning the Minister's explanation that the social welfare and taxation matters would be dealt with in the next social welfare Bill or the next finance Bill, which is how it will be.  However, it would be helpful if the Minister would indicate — as he has already done in Committee — the intention of the Government in regard to the social welfare and taxation provisions.  Obviously I do not expect the Minister to outline the specific sections of Acts that will be amended.  However, I would like him to indicate the Government's broad intention in those two matters.

It is just a matter of when it will take effect.  The Department of Finance is adamant that taxation law cannot be changed in any Act other than in a finance Act.  That is one of the reasons we did not accede to the request from, I believe, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to have the Bill enacted within three months.  If we were to do that, there would be no taxation provisions flowing from the intentions of the Bill in place within three months because obviously the next finance Bill will be after the budget.

We obviously need to wait for the taxation provisions to be changed which can happen only by way of a finance Act.  That has always been the position, which is why we need that flexibility.  In answer to Deputy Ó Snodaigh, it would not be possible to make it retrospective because some people would have already paid.  It is not possible to make changes to taxation and stamp duty on the basis that people would have already paid.  It could possibly be done, but there would be a loss to the Exchequer in that respect.  Our intention is to dovetail these pieces of legislation so they become applicable on the one day.

In page 42, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:"50.—(1) The court may, on making a maintenance order under section 44, order the maintenance debtor in addition, or instead of such an order, to make a lump sum payment or lump sum payments to the maintenance creditor of such amount or amounts and at such time or times as may be specified in the order.(2) The amount or aggregate amount of a lump sum payment or of lump sum payments to a maintenance creditor under an order under this section shall be—(a) if the order is instead of an order for the making of periodical payments to the maintenance creditor, such amount as the court considers appropriate having regard to the amount of the periodical payments that would have been made, and the periods during which and the times at which they would have been made, but for this section, and(b) if the first-mentioned order is in addition to an order for the making of periodical payments to the maintenance creditor, such amount as the court considers appropriate having regard to the amount of the periodical payments and the periods during which and the times at which they will be made.(3) The amount or aggregate amount of a lump sum payment or of lump sum payments provided for in an order of the District Court under this section shall not exceed €6,350.".Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 insert additional provisions relating to the maintenance of civil partners, which are relevant to existing provisions for spouses in the family law code.  A civil partner may apply under section 44 for maintenance from the other civil partner, while the couple are still legally civil partners of each other.  Where a maintenance order has been made under section 44, amendment No. 18 inserts a new section 15 to allow the court to make lump-sum maintenance orders.  Amendment No. 19 inserts a new section 51 to allow a court to make secured maintenance orders.  These amendments give the maintenance creditor greater assurance that the maintenance will be paid.

We signalled these because they mirror sections 41 and 42 of the Family Law Act 1995, which allows the making of lump-sum orders and secured periodical payment orders for spouses without the requirement for a judicial separation.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	684	I move amendment No. 20:
In page 48, line 28, to delete "subject to subsections (3) to (7),".We had some debate about this amendment on Committee Stage.  It arises from a submission we received from the Law Society, which claimed this amendment is required.  It seeks to avoid what the Law Society believes is guaranteed litigation and guaranteed uncertainty.  If the amendment is agreed the share of the surviving partner in a civil partnership is clear and certain and there will be less likelihood of visits to the courts.  The position would be on a par with the position that obtains under existing law in respect of surviving spouses, which is as it should be.  In the absence of the amendment, there would be uncertainty and more than that there would be a positive incentive for people to litigate.  As I believe I said on Committee Stage, it speaks volumes that people who make their living from litigation should say this is a bridge too far and request not to bring uncertainty and almost unavoidable visits to courts upon them.On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he did not particularly want to accept the amendment because of some constitutional fear that it was too close to marriage and that in terms of the Succession Acts he wanted some differentiation.  I am minded to take careful note of what the Law Society recommends in this matter.  Certainty should be one of the hallmarks of all legislation we pass.  If the professionals in this regard are indicating that we should make this amendment, we should pay careful attention to that.  The Minister will have had an opportunity to revisit the case I made at some length on Committee Stage, reading into the official record the stated case of the Law Society.  I do not propose to take up the time of the House in doing that yet again.  I would have hoped the Minister would have had a chance to reflect on it since Committee.  The general reason he gave for not accepting it was that we needed to somehow nod to the Constitution as this would be perceived as mirroring marriage that might undermine the enactment.  I do not believe a good case was made in that regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	685	The Attorney General has advised that it is essential to provide additional rights for the children of an intestate civil partner in order to vindicate the constitutional protection of the marital family.  Thus children of a deceased civil partner may apply to the court for provision out of the estate.  This applies regardless of whether the children are the children of a prior marriage, because I do not consider it acceptable to treat children differently under succession law on the basis of whether their parents were married.  The effect of subsection (3) in this case may be to reduce the share of the estate taken by the surviving civil partner.  This is mitigated by providing in subsection (3) that provision be made for a child only if the court is of the opinion that it would be unjust not to make the order after considering all the circumstances, including those set out in subsection (3)(a) to subsection (3)(d).  This is a balance struck on the provisions so that the constitutional position is respected, while ensuring the civil partner is not unjustly deprived of a share in the partner’s estate.Deputy Howlin highlighted that the effect of the provisions he seeks to delete is to remove certainty on succession on intestacy for a person whose civil partner has children.  He is correct in this.  Where a deceased civil partner dies intestate with no children, the provisions on intestacy are identical to those for a spouse with no children.  Where a deceased civil partner dies intestate and has children, subsections (3) to (7) allow the child of the civil partner to apply for a greater portion of the estate than the intestacy provisions set out, and this may cause greater uncertainty for the surviving civil partner in particular.  The share for which that child may apply is for a maximum of the portion of the estate to which he or she would have been entitled had the parent died with no spouse and no civil partner.These provisions have been carefully construed in close consultation with the Attorney General in order to protect the constitutional rights of the civil partner's child, who may be the child of a marital family.  I do not accept that there will be a flood of litigation and the numbers of affected surviving civil partners may very well be small.  An application to court may arise under the section only if there is no will and if the deceased civil partner has children, whether from a previous marriage or otherwise.

This section illustrates my argument as to why we should have gone for full civil marriage.  In that case there would be full rights across the board.  I will not take up time today on the issue but this is one instance where there is a failure to deliver full rights to civil partnership and an approach of civil marriage would have had a better effect in this case and been more equal for all involved.

I find it regrettable that the Minister is not for turning, notwithstanding what he said about the legal advice of the Attorney General.  In effect we are introducing an element of discrimination by treating the child of a civil partner differently.  Later in the legislation we can see that what we are doing does not have the same applicability in respect of cohabitees.I believed a fairly compelling case was made in the submission from the Law Society but if the Minister is not for turning on the issue, I am unsure as to whether further debate will be of any great benefit.  There is an issue which may have to be revisited at some future stage.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I also regret that the Minister has not moved his position since Committee Stage.  The Minister was part of the group which spent two years in a committee debating the constitutional amendment relating to children.  The objective we had in that committee was to craft an amendment to ensure all children were treated equally.  We hope to put that amendment to the people before the end of the year or as soon as is practicable.We rehearsed and examined the application of all the laws of the State as they affect children and we must correct many anomalies.  Two very eminent counsels assisted the committee in its deliberations and we considered the ways in which children were treated in a different fashion.There would be a case for the Minister to make if he was making improvements for children in general and if his suggestion was one of general application but creating a specific way of dealing with the children of civil partners is not acceptable.  I do not accept the logic that it is necessary to create a difference and show there is a constitutional difference between the consequences of determining the succession rights of different categories of children; that is, the children of the surviving partner in a civil partnership and the children of a surviving partner in marriage.I am tempted to read the submission from the Law Society which deals in some detail with section 117 of the Succession Act and the complications which have arisen but I will not do so.  As the society indicated in its submission, as there has been so much litigation relating to succession under that section, the case law is now understood well enough for lawyers to give decent advice to people.  The problem with this provision is there is no case law yet and it would be difficult for practitioners to give clear advice to people entering into civil partnerships in this regard.I am minded to agree with Deputy Flanagan in that there is no point in spending an inordinate amount of time going around the same roundabout if the Minister has not moved.  I expect a stronger justification for the Minister not moving in this regard.

It is balanced because it relates to only when the court is of the opinion that it would be unjust not to make the order.  The court may, on application of one of the children of an intestate who dies leaving a civil partner and children, order that the provision be made for that child out of the intestate's estate only if the court is of the opinion that it would be unjust not to make the order after considering all the circumstances.It is, in effect, to protect children in these circumstances that this action is being undertaken.  It goes back to the point I made at the start of this discussion, on Committee Stage and Second Stage in that we must strike a balance between the constitutional requirements relating to the protection of marriage.  It has been defined many times that marriage is between a man and a woman and this was confirmed in a recent Supreme Court case among other cases.  That is the reason we must have these distinctions.This is couched in such a way that the court must satisfy itself that it is making this order in circumstances only where it is just to make that order and not unjust.  I strongly suggest that the amendments from the Deputies are trying to replicate what is already there with regard to spouses.  With regard to the protection of children, which goes to the core of my proposed amendment, we must ensure children have additional rights in order to apply for provision that would not be made for them in an intestacy position.

In page 50, line 14, to delete "Subject to section 117(3A),".The Minister may have given this matter consideration since we debated it on Committee Stage.  The arguments and points in favour of the amendment remain the same.  I wonder if the Minister has given further consideration to the matter and if he is prepared to accept any of the points put forward on Committee Stage.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	699	Section 83 was examined in detail on Committee Stage.  I indicated at that time that the section as formulated is essential to provide additional rights for the children of a civil partner who dies leaving a will in order to ensure in all cases that the constitutional protection of the marital family is vindicated.  This provision is included following strong advice from the Attorney General.To achieve a balance between the constitutional imperative to protect the marital family and the succession rights of a civil partner on testacy, section 83 ensures that where a child of a civil partner applies under section 117 of the Succession Act for provision from the deceased parent's estate, an order shall not affect the share of the surviving civil partner unless the court considers it would be unjust not to make the order taking account of all of the circumstances, including the testator's financial circumstances and his or her surviving partner.  This is a high threshold for making an order which would reduce the surviving partner's share and provide significant protection to the surviving partner.Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 to delete section 83 of the Bill would be highly significant and would have the effect of leaving the surviving partner's share in the estate of the deceased partner wholly unprotected if a child or children of the deceased were to make an application under section 117 of the Succession Act for the provision from the estate of their parent.  The amendment does this by removing any restriction on the court's discretion to reallocate the share of the civil partner.The effect of amendments Nos. 25 and 27 would leave the surviving civil partner's share in the estate of their deceased partner as strongly protected as that of a spouse if a child or children of the deceased were to make an application under section 177 of the Succession Act for provision from the estate of their parent.  This would risk upsetting a fine constitutional balance.  The provision in the Bill is carefully constructed to ensure that the rights of children, who may be the children of a marital family, are fully vindicated while affording a high level of protection to civil partners.  Spouses are afforded a higher level of protection because of the constitutional protection for the institution of marriage.  Following enactment of the Civil Partnership Bill 2010 and, as succession law stands, section 117 applications may be made in any case.  Section 83 will not encourage or impede children in making section 117 applications but will allow the court to make an order in their favour to the surviving civil partner's detriment only if it is unjust not to make the order.  I believe this achieves a fair balance of the competing rights.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	700	In the provisions before us, the succession rights of a civil partner to another civil partner are less protected and vaguer than are those of a married couple in terms of testacy and intestacy.  That is the conclusion one reaches.  Obviously, this is by design.  I believe that is unfortunate and will lead to difficulty in terms of providing, with absolute certainty or clarity, legal advice to people entering into civil partnerships, which is to be regretted.

Section 97 of the Bill makes a number of changes to the equal treatment provisions of the Pension Act reflecting the introduction of civil partnership.  This amendment addresses an omission where the change from marital to civil status was not carried out.

In page 63, line 4, to delete "of section 127” and substitute “of section 128”.This amendment corrects a cross reference error in the Bill.  Section 115 sets out how property adjustment orders may be made.  Subsection (2) specifies that a property adjustment order may restrict or exclude the application of section 127 to such an order.

In page 70, line 40, to delete "of the net estate" and substitute "of the estate".Both amendments clarify section 124 which deals with the applications for provision from the estate of a deceased civil partner.  The reference to "net estate" is not necessary as any provision from the estate of the deceased civil partner is necessarily after the settlement of prior claims.  Accordingly, amendment No. 30 removes the term "net".Amendment No. 31 specifies that the section applies to a civil partner whose civil partnership has been dissolved.  Given that the section is in the part of the Bill governing dissolution and ancillary orders that may be made on dissolution this is already implicit.  However, it is not clearly stated and accordingly amendment No. 31 rectifies that omission.

In page 85, line 22, to delete "adults" and substitute "persons".Section 169(1) of the Bill as circulated states: "For the purposes of this Part, a cohabitant is one of 2 adults (whether of the same or the opposite sex) who live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship..."  It has been pointed out to me that an adult is a person aged 18 years or over.  Current law sets the age of consent at 17 years.  The Minister will know that during the deliberations of the all-party committee in regard to the children's amendment the majority of the committee, including members of the Minister's party, recommended that the age of consent be set at 16 years.  In any event, as the law now stands a 17 year old can engage in an intimate and committed relationship but would be excluded from being a cohabitant under the definition currently enshrined in section 169.  I do not want to speculate on the reasons people under the age of 18 years are excluded.  Perhaps this is because they are not permitted to marry under the age of 18 years unless they have special exemption.  In any event, there is an anomaly here that would be better met by the formulation I am suggesting.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The effect of this amendment by replacing "adults" with "persons" is to allow children to be designated as cohabitants for the purpose of the Bill.  There does not appear to be any sound reason for so doing.  There is an unintended effect on the Bill as initiated.  The domestic violence protections which currently apply to a couple living together as husband and wife would have been removed from persons under the age of 18 years.  This has been remedied by deleting on Committee Stage the domestic violence provisions from the Bill and inserting them in the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which is due to be published shortly.  I made this point on Committee Stage.  The miscellaneous provisions Bill will provide that it will continue to be possible for an application for a domestic violence order to be made by a person living in a couple, where one of them is over the age of consent but under the age of majority.I will mention the only remaining provisions in Part 15 which apply to cohabitants.  Section 199 extends to cohabitants a provision of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 so that a cohabitant may take over a lease of a residential property on the death of the other cohabitant.  As a child does not have the legal capacity to contract, this provision could not, in any case, apply to a cohabitant under the age of 18.  The other instance is under section 200, which extends to cohabitants a provision of the Civil Liability Act 1961 so that a cohabitant may seek damages in the event of the wrongful death of the other cohabitant.  This measure is subject to the couple having cohabited for at least three years.  Clearly, there are no circumstances in which a child should be encompassed by that provision if the relationship is "intimate and committed", as provided for in section 170(1).  In these circumstances, the amendment has no effect.The Deputy's objective in proposing this amendment may be to ensure that a couple living together since one of them was 17 will be covered by the redress provisions, if the relationship ends while that person is 22.  The potentially onerous obligations — or, indeed, potential benefits — under the redress scheme should apply only to cohabitants as adults.  This is because a key feature of section 198, in Part 15, is that cohabiting couples must also be able to contract out of the application to them of the redress scheme.  A child cannot enter into such a contract.  Therefore, cohabitation as a minor should not be included in the time period required to become a qualified cohabitant, as set out in section 169(5) of the Bill.  This means that a couple who commenced cohabiting when one of them was under the age of 18 cannot be subject to those obligations until they have been cohabiting for at least five years and each of them has reached the age of 23, or, if there is a child of the relationship, that they have been cohabiting for at least two years and each of them has reached the minimum age of 20.

When a Minister reads a prepared answer that was written before one made one's case, there is always a danger that it will address arguments one did not make, which can be very interesting.  I do not think the definition, as it stands, will create difficulties that cannot be overcome.  I will withdraw the amendment for that reason.

In page 85, line 23, to delete "and committed".This issue was the subject of considerable debate on Committee Stage.  I do not intend to revisit the arguments that were made, other than to suggest there may be a difficulty with the definitions of "cohabitant" and "qualified cohabitant" in the Bill.  Section 170(1) provides that "a cohabitant is one of 2 adults (whether of the same or the opposite sex) who live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship".  I suggest that "intimate" does not necessarily mean "sexual".  Section 170 creates an implication that the relationship must, at some stage, have been sexual.  I am concerned that the use of the word "committed" may cause difficulties and lead to protracted legal argument.  I do not have a difficulty with the reference to adults living together as a couple in an "intimate" relationship.  However, the requirement that the relationship must be both "intimate" and "committed" could be construed in a manner that is somewhat different from what is intended.  Since the Committee Stage debate, the Minister has had an opportunity to assess the points that were made about this provision, which could give rise to a lack of clarity, uncertainty and considerable legal argument.  While I will not press the matter, I suggest that this issue could well feature in protracted litigation and give rise to an element of uncertainty which is not intended in the legislation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	710	I submitted this amendment on foot of a submission I received from Women's Aid.  I am sure all the other members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights received the same document.  As I said on Committee Stage, Women's Aid has argued that a woman might have difficulty proving before a court that a relationship was "committed", if that fact is contested by her cohabitee.  The fear that has been raised is that the word "committed" might create a new barrier for a woman who seeks a protective order under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  It has been suggested that it may be used by an abuser to prevent such a woman's concerns from being addressed.  The Minister gave detailed responses when we raised these matters on Committee Stage.  There is a vagueness about the word "committed" that has the potential to cause problems.  This issue relates to what used to be called a "conjugal" relationship.Much of this debate has been muddied by people trying to equate all sorts of other relationships with what is being proposed here.  The provisions of both aspects of this Bill — that dealing with cohabitation and that dealing with civil partnerships — relate to two people, of the same sex or of opposite sex, who are in a committed sexual relationship with each other.  It is obvious that such people will not have to prove they are currently in a sexual relationship with each other, as long as they have had such a relationship with each other.  That is at the heart of this legislation.  We have listened to all sorts of extraneous references to various types of couplings or groupings.  People have sought to equate relationships with maiden aunts and others with what is at issue here.  That approach does an injustice to the objective set out by the Minister and by this House, which is at the heart of what this measure is intended to address.  While I fully appreciate the Minister's intent in using the word "committed", I am concerned about how it can be proved that the relationship is a committed one.  I do not suggest that it should not be a committed one.  I am also worried that the use of the word "committed" could be an impediment to the protection of an individual who is in such a relationship, if that fact is subsequently contested by his or her partner.

We are talking about the availability of the redress scheme to cohabitants.  Just in case anyone thinks we are talking about same-sex couples only, I assure the House that this relates not just to same-sex couples but also to heterosexual couples.  It is a question of providing a safety net for couples, in terms of financial dependency, in case they split up.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	712	It can be in terms of protection orders or anything else.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Absolutely.  The normal designation in any legislation of this nature is the use of the term "living as husband and wife".  That is the phrase we normally use.  We have had to come up with a similar phrase in this case, obviously, as we cannot use the phrase "husband and wife" in the context of a provision that will apply to same-sex partners.  We have come up with the term "intimate and committed" for these purposes.  Given that former cohabitants can potentially face onerous court obligations under this redress scheme, it is right and proper that the situation would have to be one of commitment.  The behaviour of either party at the time when the relationship was breaking up is not a factor for the court to consider in making its determination.  Section 169(2) clearly indicates:In determining whether or not 2 adults are cohabitants, the court shall take into account all the circumstances of the relationship and in particular shall have regard to the following:(a) the duration of the relationship;(b) the basis on which the couple live together;(c) the degree of financial dependence of either adult on the other and any agreements in respect of their finances;(d) the degree and nature of any financial arrangements between the adults including any joint purchase of an estate or interest in land or joint acquisition of personal property;(e) whether there are one or more dependent children;(f) whether one of the adults cares for and supports the children of the other; and(g) the degree to which the adults present themselves to others as a couple.The seven factors that are listed are not exclusive.In order to give certainty regarding who complies with this provision, I suggest that the terminology "intimate and committed" is preferable to the one suggested by the Deputies, which is simply "an intimate relationship".
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I move amendment No. 34:
In page 86, lines 7 to 12, to delete all words from and including "if — " in line 7 down to and including "Act." in line 12 and substitute the following:"if sexual activity between them would be an offence having regard to their age or the fact that they are relatives.".Subsection 169(4) states: "For the purposes of this section, 2 adults are within a prohibited degree of relationship if (a) they would be prohibited from marrying each other in the State.”  One of the impediments covered by this section is if couples are in a prohibited degree of relationship.  This section does not apply if a couple would be prohibited from marrying each other in the State.  Of course, every same-sex couple is prohibited from marrying in the State, under the Constitution.  Is it the Minister’s intention to exclude every same-sex couple from the provisions of this section?There is a drafting problem here that needs to be addressed.  Same-sex couples would be prohibited from marrying each other, as would anyone who was still married to a third party.  Such a person would be excluded from marrying and, therefore, excluded from the definition of cohabitant in the Bill.Is it the Minister's intention that opposite-sex couples would be covered by this section but that same-sex couples would not?  Would the definition I put forward not better meet the impediment intended, as I understand it, that is, "if sexual activity between them would be an offence having regard to the age or the fact that they are relatives"?  It is not that they are debarred from marrying but that they would be under age or there would be issues of consanguinity which would prevent their marriage in law.  If that is not specified, the section will not apply to same-sex couples, who obviously cannot marry.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	715	Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (4) are alternatives.  Subsection (4) clearly states that two adults are within a prohibited degree of relationship if (a) they would be prohibited from marrying each other in the State, or (b) they are in a relationship referred to in the 2004 Act.This subsection confines the scope of the Bill to a couple living in an intimate and committed relationship where the couple is not within the prohibited degrees of relationship.  The prohibited degrees of relationship as they apply in marriage are long established.  The prohibited degrees of relationship for the purpose of the Civil Partnership Bill are set out in section 26.  In each case the prohibited degrees of relationship are defined and specific so that persons within these degrees are excluded from cohabitants' provisions.Deputy Howlin's amendment seeks to replace these clearly defined relationships by a reference to sexual activity which would be an offence having regard to the age of the persons.  There is no question of a criminal offence arising out of sexual activity between two adults on the grounds of their age.  The reference is, therefore, redundant.Second, the amendment refers to sexual activity being an offence having regard to the fact that the couple are relatives.  This is seriously flawed since the criminal law on incest, the Punishment of Incest Act 1908, defines incest as the carnal knowledge of a male with a female who, to his knowledge, is his granddaughter, daughter, sister or mother or a female aged 17 or over who consensually permits her grandfather, father, brother or son to have carnal knowledge of her, knowing the male is such a relative.  This is far less extensive than the list of relatives prohibited from marrying each other on the grounds that they are consanguineous and, notably, does not include sexual relationships between those close relatives of the same sex.  This, potentially, allows a large number of other people living together to qualify as cohabitants.  This would not only erroneously increase the potential burden on the courts but would undermine the clear recognition by this House, and I am sure by Deputy Howlin, that the intimate and committed conjugal relationship of a couple is qualitatively different from even the closest caring relationship between friends and family.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The Minister has lost me.  I am reading plain English here.  Section 169 sets out what is a cohabitant.  For the purposes of Part 15, which deals with cohabitation, a cohabitant is one of two adults, whether of the same or the opposite sex, who live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship and who are not related to each other within the prohibited degrees of relationship or married to each other or civil partners of each other.Subsection 169(4) states that "for the purposes of this section, 2 adults are within a prohibited degree of relationship if they would be prohibited from marrying each other in the State".  Clearly, same-sex couples are in a prohibited degree of relationship because they cannot marry.  Is that not clear to the Minister?

Subsection 169(4) states that for the purposes of this section two adults are within a prohibited degree of relationship if either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) applies to them.  The Minister refers to the connection between paragraph (b) and the new section 26.  I am concerned with paragraph (b).  To be within the prohibited degree of relationship it is not necessary that paragraphs (a) and (b) both apply.  It is only necessary that one of them apply.  Clearly, every same-sex couple would be prohibited under paragraph (a).  I do not want to hear about section 26.  I am talking about paragraph 169(4)(a).
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	721	We may, perhaps, look at this before the Bill is debated in the Seanad.  However, my advice is that under the Interpretation Act 2005, those who would be prohibited from marrying would not include same-sex couples, given the fact that we are debating civil partnership legislation and that the references in section 26 take care of the prohibited relationships.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	722	That cannot be right.

The Minister is stating in black and white they are in a prohibited degree of relationship, in other words they are prohibited from availing from this section on cohabitation if, first, they would be prohibited from marrying each other in the State.  Clearly, it remains the case that same sex couples cannot marry in this State.

By putting in wording to the effect that sexual activity between them would be an offence having regard to their age or the fact that they are relatives would not in any way advance this.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	727	It would.  I understood that what the Minister intended by putting in paragraph  (a) was the normal prohibition on marrying,  which exists for good reasons.  One cannot marry people who are closely related or those under a certain age.  “Consanguinity, affinity or other relationships” comprised the marriage ban that used to be read out in church.  These are the legal impediments normal to marriage.  However, the Minister has used the bald phrase, “would be prohibited from marrying”, to capture all of that and in doing so he has also captured the constitutional prohibition we have in the interpretation of marriage by the Supreme Court as prohibiting the marriage of same sex couples.

In page 86, to delete lines 21 to 29.This concerns the definition of a qualified cohabitant under section 169.  We propose that subsection (6) of section 169 be deleted because it is unnecessarily restrictive.  I am concerned that the consequences will give rise to difficulty.  It is interesting that this subsection was not included in the original heads of the Bill, published in 2007 and I wonder from where the Minister is coming.We agree that a person cannot be a qualified cohabitant if one or both persons is, or was at any time during the relationship, married to another person when that relationship has ended, or if a party dies and had not lived apart from their spouse within the appropriate period.  I gave an example on Committee Stage and was disappointed that the Minister's response was not in any way understanding or favourable.  For the purpose of outlining the hardship involved and for the benefit of the House I shall repeat that example, briefly.Let us take the example of a husband and wife who separate on 1 January 2010.  On 1 March 2011, 15 months later, the husband meets a new partner.  On 1 September 2011, the husband and new partner commence living together permanently.  In February 2013, the husband and his new partner have a child.  The couple decide the mother should give up work and look after the baby.  In December 2013, the husband leaves his new partner.  Although the woman is a qualified cohabitant because she has been living with her partner for two years and has had a child, nevertheless she is not a qualified cohabitant on the basis that the husband has not lived apart from his wife for the requisite period of four years.There is a clear injustice there to the dependent cohabitant and her child.  This injustice would not be perpetrated on the cohabitant and the child if subsection (6) was removed.  There is an issue of equality involved which will give rise to a situation where in the event of one of the parties dying the legal person representative in a constitutional challenge will be embroiled in protracted court proceedings.  In effect, we are treating two cohabitants in different ways, depending solely on the marital status of one cohabitant, which is a problem.  We adverted to it on Committee Stage and I had hoped the Minister would have given the matter some consideration since then.There is another example, the case of a cohabitant who was living with a cohabitant, now deceased, who had a valid foreign divorce.  That cohabitant would be denied qualified cohabitant status if the divorce, though legally valid, was too recent to allow the deceased cohabitant to be in compliance with the time limit under Article 41.3 of the Constitution.  This would arise in a situation where two Irish people marry and divorce in England.  They process the divorce within a few months of separating but prior to the divorce being finalised the deceased cohabitant moves home to Ireland to live, has a child with the cohabitant and dies three years afterwards.  That cohabitant is denied the qualified cohabitant status which again would not be perpetrated in the form of an injustice on the person if subsection (6) were removed.Again, I ask the Minister why subsection (6) was introduced in this restrictive manner, having regard to the fact that it was not part of the original heads of the Bill that were published in 2007.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I agree with the rationale put forward by Deputy Flanagan on this matter.  We are discussing the partial exclusion of people from availing of the provisions of cohabitation based on marriage.  In its consultation paper, the Law Reform Commission originally proposed to exclude all cohabiting relationships where one or both cohabitants is married to a third party.  I understood the reasoning behind the commission's view was that if the State, by its laws, were to recognise and improve the position of a cohabitee who is already married to somebody else those laws would undermine the constitutional institute of marriage.  That was the reasoning the Minister gave on Committee Stage.The Law Reform Commission changed its view because it was criticised.  In its report it changed its attitude and accepted it would not be appropriate to exclude married cohabitants.  Although the Minister does not include a general exclusion in this subsection he has made a partial exclusion.  The effect of the subsection is to remove from the definition of qualified cohabitant someone who lives with a person who may be long separated but not formally divorced from a former partner.They could be separated for four years, although not formally divorced.  After four years, the Bill as proposed would be prepared to include such couples.  It is my view that this will create unfairness and discrimination.There is also a contradiction between subsections 4(a) and subsection 5, because subsection 5 implies that at least some married persons could be cohabitants, whereas subsection 4(a), taken in conjunction with subsection (1), implies that no married persons are cohabitants.  My advice is that this constitutes an arbitrary and an unnecessarily complex set of exclusions.  I hope the Minister reflects upon that.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I said on Committee Stage that this was carefully drafted in order to ensure the constitutional protection for marriage was fully vindicated.  Subsection (6) was drafted to ensure that the spouse is not disadvantaged in seeking various ancillary orders on separation or divorce, if the other spouse becomes a qualified cohabitant of the third party who seeks redress under the Bill.  The provision ensures that the cohabiting spouse cannot become a qualified cohabitant until the spouses have been living apart for at least four out of the previous five years.  It was examined again by the Attorney General during the publication of the heads of the Bill and during the drafting in order to ensure that there was additional protection for spouses, given the constitutional imperative of the protection of marriage.Deputy Flanagan raised the issue of a couple who cohabit, have a child together but who separate before they have been cohabiting for two years.  In such a case, maintenance is payable in respect of a child under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, as amended.  However, no maintenance is payable by either cohabitant to the other, as they will not have become qualified cohabitants.  It is one of these issues where there is a distinction in order to vindicate the rights of the spouse and to coincide with the constitutional protection of marriage.  The time period we are envisaging for this is similar to that which pertains to the qualifying period for divorce.  This is the type of compromise that must be reached in order to ensure that this Bill is constitutionally sound.  That is the advice I have received from the Attorney General.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	744	I move amendment No. 36:
In page 86, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:"170.—It shall be the objective of the court in exercising powers under this Part, insofar as possible, to make such orders as will finally determine the financial arrangements between the parties and avoid further proceedings between them.".This is an important addition.  We had problems with divorce legislation because the balance of support for the entire concept of divorce at the time was so close.  We did not have finality on the issue and it has caused some difficulties where, even after a long separation, there is a possibility of people coming back again to revisit things.  I am suggesting here that we would state, as a matter of duty on the court, that in making orders and in exercising its powers under this part, in so far as it is possible, financial arrangements between the parties are final, so that there are no further legal proceedings years later.The particular form or words I am putting forward in this amendment is based on legislation from New South Wales.  There are strong and compelling reasons, in so far as the Constitution and natural justice allow, for a clean break approach to be made in financial matters in the context of cohabitation.  This is spelled out in other jurisdictions, such as New South Wales.  The amendment is a direction that we would give to the courts so that the intention of the Oireachtas is seen to be a clean break decision that would not be an incremental re-visitation of the financial arrangements over time.

The courts always have a view that if they can bring finality to arrangements, they will do so.  However, there are always cases involving couples where there will be a change of circumstance as time moves on.  The court must have the ability to change if new circumstances prevail between the couples.  The portent of what the Deputy is proposing would be mandatory.  He accepts that it is not possible to do this in every case and that he is trying to avoid further proceedings.  We would wish that such would be the case, but the way the amendment is drafted is to ensure that there is an emphasis on dealing with it once and for all.  Anybody who has practised family law knows that from time to time, circumstances change and one person has to come back into court and make an application because of that change of circumstances.  The Deputy's amendment could cause difficulty in that respect.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	747	I would like it to be accepted because many people who have dealt with litigation in divorce proceedings would like us to revisit that and end matters.  It is very difficult for people who are in a relationship and when the relationship ends, there are matters to be settled.  The notion that in five, six or ten years' time, when people have gone on to live another life, somebody will haul them back for a resettlement, is unjust in and of itself.  While we cannot legislate for it to be the final instalment, we can indicate, from statutes in jurisdictions similar to our own, the will of the Oireachtas to the courts that it is an objective, in so far as possible, that there be finality in respect of these orders.  I am sorry the Minister is not willing to accept that.

Section 170(6) states that the court, may, on the application of the qualified cohabitant or the other cohabitant, if it considers it proper to do so, make varying orders.  The Deputy's suggestion may well discourage one party from taking an application to vary or suspend.  Couples circumstances do change.

It is possible that financial circumstances change and that one party is paying maintenance to the other, and there is no necessity for it anymore.  Although it is not absolutely mandatory, the Deputy is trying to bring finality once and for all and, with all due respect, I do not think he can do that.

For example, on the simple matter of mandatory sentencing on which the Minister has argued, we do not ever put absolute mandatory sentencing into statute law except in regard to murder.  There is always an opt-out clause for the court to make a different determination.  Even when we say this is the mandatory sentence, we give flexibility to the courts, because of the separation of powers, to make a different interpretation in the context of the case before them.  This is not in any way unique.  I will withdraw the amendment.

In page 100, line 29, to delete "6 months" and substitute "12 months".This is a straightforward and simple administrative matter on which I will not dwell to any great extent, other than to ask the Minister to facilitate the introduction of an element of conformity.  A spouse has 12 months from the grant of representation to assert his or her rights but a cohabitant has only six months to do so.  A challenge by a cohabitant to an estate could be under way without the cohabitant knowing the position in regard to the spouse.  That would place a legal personal representative in a difficult position.The amendment merely makes 12 months the standard.  It introduces an element of clarity.  Why do different time limits apply for different classes of relationship?  This is an administrative matter and I will not divide the House on it, but there is an issue in this respect.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	756	It is not the standard because the standard in regard to a divorced spouse is that he or she has to apply within six months of a grant of representation, either under section 18(1) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act or under section 25(1) of the Family Law Act 1995;  where a divorce is granted outside this State, a spouse who is separated or whose succession rights were quashed under grant of a decree, a judicial separation must also apply for provision within six months of that grant of representation.  There is a six months time limit available to a former civil partner under section 124(1) of this Bill.  Introducing a 12 month-period would introduce an inconsistency, even within the Bill, quite apart from an inconsistency in regard to the time period relating to family law generally in terms of reliefs that are laid down in other legislation.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	757	I move amendment No. 38:
In page 102, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:"193.—(1) Subject to the other provisions of this section, the Circuit Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court to hear and determine applications for orders for redress referred to in section 170 and orders for provision from the estates of deceased cohabitants under section 191.(2) The District Court, and the Circuit Court on appeal from the District Court, have concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court to hear and determine applications for orders for redress referred to in section 170 and orders for provision from the estates of deceased cohabitants under section 191, except that—(a) they do not have jurisdiction to make such an order for periodical payments at a rate greater than €500 per week,(b) they do not have jurisdiction to make such an order in a matter in relation to which the High Court has made such an order, and(c) the District Court does not have jurisdiction to make such an order in a matter in relation to which the Circuit Court has made such an order otherwise than on appeal from the District Court.(3) The court shall only exercise its jurisdiction to hear and determine an application for an order for redress referred to in section 170 if both of the cohabitants concerned were ordinarily resident in the State throughout the one-year period prior to the end of their relationship, and either of the cohabitants—(a) is domiciled in the State on the date on which the application is made, or(b) is ordinarily resident in the State throughout the one-year period that ends on that date.(4) The court shall only exercise its jurisdiction to hear and determine an application for an order for provision from the estate of a deceased cohabitant under section 191 if—(a) in the case where the relationship concerned ended before the death of the deceased, each of the cohabitants concerned was ordinarily resident in the State throughout the one-year period prior to the end of their relationship and—(i) each of the cohabitants concerned was ordinarily resident in the State throughout the one-year period that ended on the date of the death of the deceased,(ii) on the date of the death of the deceased, the applicant was in receipt of periodical payments from the deceased, whether under an order made under section 172 or pursuant to a cohabitants’ agreement or otherwise,(iii) the applicant had, not later than 2 years after that relationship ended, made an application for an order under section 171, 172 or 184 and either—(I) the proceedings were pending at the time of the death, or(II) any such order made by the court had not yet been executed,or(iv) the applicant had, not later than 2 years after the relationship ended, made an application for an order under section 171, 172 or 184, the order was made, an application under section 170(6) was subsequently made in respect of that order and either—(I) the proceedings were pending at the time of the death, or(II) any such order made by the court under section 170(6) in favour of the applicant had not yet been executed,and(b) in any other case, each of the cohabitants concerned was ordinarily resident in the State throughout the one-year period that ended on the date of the death of the deceased.(5) The jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Court may be exercised by the judge of the circuit in which a party to the application ordinarily resides or carries on a business, profession or occupation.(6) The Circuit Court shall transfer, to the High Court, proceedings on applications for orders for redress referred to in section 170, on application to it by a party to the application for the order concerned, if land to which the proceedings relate—(a) has a rateable valuation that exceeds €254, or(b) has not been given a rateable valuation or is the subject with other land of a rateable valuation, if the Circuit Court determines that the rateable valuation would exceed €254.(7) An order made or act done in the course of the proceedings before a transfer under subsection (6) is valid unless discharged or varied by the High Court.”.This amendment inserts a new section 193 into the Bill.  Its purpose is to rectify the omission from the Bill, as initiated, of detailed jurisdictional rules relating to proceedings under Part 15.  The jurisdiction rules are similar to those in section 137 for civil partnership proceedings.  It varies in a number of details which I will briefly set out.Subsections (1) and (2) are standard.Subsection (3) differs in that the jurisdiction conferred on the court is dependent not only on the domicile or ordinary residence of a party to proceedings on the date the proceedings are initiated, but on the couple having been ordinarily resident in the State for at least the year before the relationship ended.  This is to ensure that not only does a party to the proceedings have a close connection with the State, but the relationship itself has a close relationship with the State.  It may be easiest to understand if I give an example: a couple — their nationality is irrelevant — meet and live together in an intimate and committed relationship for an extended period in, say, Germany.  Immediately on the end of the relationship one of them moves to Ireland and lives here for a year.  If we do not confine the jurisdiction of the court, the person who has moved to Ireland could, in theory, make an application for redress against the other person.  This is although the relationship itself never had any connection with Ireland, neither of the parties has any past connection with the State, and the other person may never have lived here.Subsection (3) insures against this by providing that the couple themselves must have been ordinarily resident in the State in the year prior to the ending of the relationship, as well as requiring that at least one of them have an ongoing connection with the State, either by their domicile or ordinary residence.Subsection (4), which deals with applications for provision from the estate of a deceased cohabitant, is complex because full account is taken of the many situations in which such provision may be sought.  In the case of cohabitants who are still in a relationship on the date of the death, the couple are required to have been ordinarily resident in the State in the year prior to the death, establishing the connection of the relationship with the State.Where the relationship ended prior to the death, the couple are required to have been ordinarily resident in the State in the year prior to the end of the relationship, establishing the connection of the relationship with the State.  The following requirements also apply: both of the couple should be ordinarily resident in the State for the year prior to the death; or the applicant was, on the date of the death, in receipt of periodical payments from the deceased; or the applicant had applied for an order for redress or a variation of such an order, which had not yet been heard; or the applicant had applied for an order for redress or a variation of such an order, and an order had been made but had not been executed on the date of death.This is a complex set of provisions, but it ensures that a person can apply for redress only if both the relationship and the person have an ongoing connection with the State.  It further safeguards the cohabitant who was dependent on the deceased by ensuring that where the court had previously had jurisdiction in the case under subsection (3), the person remains entitled to apply for provision from the estate of the deceased.Subsections (5) to (7) are standard.  Other jurisdictional provisions relating to civil partnership proceedings are not mirrored as they deal with jurisdiction in the case of actions under Part 4 of the Bill dealing with shared home protection.  As protections similar to those under Part 4 are not extended to cohabitants or qualified cohabitants, there is no requirement to add the relevant jurisdictional rules.

In page 104, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:"200.—The definition of "dependant" in section 47(1) (as substituted by section 1 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 1996) of the Civil Liability Act 1961 is amended by substituting the following for paragraph (c):"(c) a person who was not married to or a civil partner of the deceased but who, until the date of the deceased’s death, had been living with the deceased as the deceased’s cohabitant within the meaning of section 169 of the Civil Partnership Act 2010 for a continuous period of not less than three years,”.”.Section 200 amends section 47(1) of the Civil Liability Act 1961 so that a cohabitant who meets certain criteria is a defendant for the purposes of wrongful death actions.  Under the Civil Liability Act 1961, as amended, a person living with someone as husband and wife may sue in the event of that person's wrongful death.This section implements the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that a cohabitant should be able to sue for damages irrespective of the sexual orientation of the couple concerned so that same sex cohabitants have the same rights as opposite sex cohabitants.Amendment No. 39 is a technical amendment to delete an extra word "as", however, the Minister has decided also to replace the full section, to remove any potential that it might be interpreted as applying only to opposite sex couples, whereas the intention is to provide that a cohabitant should be able to sue for damages for wrongful death, irrespective of the sexual orientation of the couple concerned.

It makes a clear and powerful statement to gay people that they will never again have their status or relationship ignored.  As I said earlier, we take nothing from anybody in this Bill; it does not undermine marriage, undermine anybody's rights or destroy anything.  We are simply giving civil rights to gay people in the form of protection and recognition by the State.  I thank Deputies Charles Flanagan and Howlin for their work on this Bill.  It will now go to the Seanad and will hopefully pass into law thereafter.  We have already indicated that the Government will pass taxation law legislation in the Finance Bill and also bring forward the necessary legislative provision in the social welfare area.Some people are of the view that this Bill does not go far enough.  Equally, there are others who believe it goes too far.  My party committed itself in our manifesto to bringing forward this legislation.  That was confirmed in the programme for Government we agreed with the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats and subsequently in the renewed programme for Government.  We are fulfilling that commitment based on existing circumstances, namely, that on the one hand we have a constitutional imperative to support marriage and on the other a constitutional imperative to treat everybody equally before the law.  The legislation is a fine balance between the two.  I thank all those who have read and fully understood the implications of the Bill.  I look forward to it being signed into law by the President once it has passed through the Seanad.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	763	I join the Minister in welcoming the passing of this very important legislation which we have been debating for several months, not in the glare of the media but in a manner that has been comprehensive.  It represents an important step forward for persons in our community who were discriminated against for many years.  It is a lengthy Bill of 118 pages and 205 sections and includes a lengthy Schedule of five Parts.  Its provisions amend up to 130 other items of legislation in order to provide protection in law for civil partners of the same sex and cohabiting couples whether of the same sex or opposite sexes.We have built on three important reports, namely, the Colley report, consequent on the working group of the same name, the Law Reform Commission report, and the report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution.  The two main planks of the Bill are the concept of registered civil partnership for same-sex couples and legal protection for cohabitants.  I thank the Minister for Justice and Law Reform for the manner in which the debate was conducted on Second Stage, in terms of the length of time allocated for the debate and the opportunity afforded every Member to comment on every aspect of the legislation, for the detailed debate on Committee Stage, and for the Report Stage debate that has just concluded.It only remains for me, as the Bill departs this House, to wish it a speedy passage through the Seanad.  I hope it will be on the Statute Book, activated and commenced, at the earliest opportunity.  I am conscious of what the Minister said this evening about the need for consequential legislation in the areas of taxation and social welfare.  I would not like to see any impediment to the enactment of the Bill resulting from delay or tardiness on the part of other Departments.  It is absolutely essential that having deliberated in this Chamber, the changes in the tax code and the social welfare system that are consequential on what we have done here are implemented at the earliest opportunity so that the Bill can commence.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	764	This is an historic moment.  I said on 3 December 2009 when I spoke on Second Stage that it was an historic day and one that was a long time coming.  We have spent several months working on this difficult but very important legislation.  The Bill we will pass in this House tonight is practical in that it gives concrete legal benefits to thousands of Irish citizens who are in committed loving relationships with partners of the same sex.  However, it does a great deal more than that; it brings Ireland a step further along the road to equality.  I indicated in my Second Stage speech that we are not there yet, that there are several steps to be taken to complete that journey and that hopefully we will be in a position in the not too distant future to put a referendum to the people in order to give true equality to same-sex couples so that they can avail not only of something that is analogous to the institution of marriage but avail of actual marriage.As I indicated, there are other issues to be dealt with.  We must see the social welfare provisions, and the Minister has given a commitment tonight that they will mirror those available to married couples.  We need also to see the taxation provisions.  In addition, we must address the issue of children.  The debate on the referendum on children's rights, when that is put to the people, will offer the context in which that issue can be fully discussed.I conclude by thanking the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, which is something I do not do very often, as he will readily agree.  He has approached this matter with a great degree of openness.  He has afforded me personally the opportunities to participate fully when other duties kept me from working within the same timeframe as him.  He has always been amenable to ensuring that the widest possible scrutiny and debate went into this ground-breaking legislation.  For my part, and on behalf of my party, we are proud to have reached this point.  I had the privilege of introducing two path-finding initiatives in this area by introducing legislation to introduce civil unions.  We nearly got there, my Bill being passed by the House on Second Stage before being kicked to touch because the timeframe set for its passage was beyond the life of that particular Dáil.  We have been waiting years for this Bill but we are here now.  For many thousands of our citizens it is an acknowledgement of their true citizenship in this Republic.  It shows a degree of maturity and a coming of age of the State.  We need not congratulate ourselves too much because there is more work to be done, but this is a good day's work.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	765	On behalf of the Green Party, I convey my deep personal appreciation to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for the work he has done.  I am very much aware from this week's events that certain issues can cause difficulty for one's partner in government.  I was aware from the negotiations we conducted on the programme for Government that this was always going to be a difficult issue.  Where there are disagreements between partners in government, it is easier to be in the smaller party.  That is not often appreciated, so I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for his courage in pushing this through even though it will cause difficulties for some Members of the Seanad.All of us here have a tolerance for other people's personal views.  We must do so if we are to be a tolerant society.  This Bill is an act of tolerance and equality.  What we are saying is that this is a step forward on the right road; it is not the whole picture.  We must remember the fight for equality is always protracted.  One need only recall the days of the suffragettes, which is not that long ago, whose first achievement was to secure the vote for women aged 30 years and over, before moving on from there.  We can now move onward from this Bill.  I support full marriage equality; that is and always has been the passionate belief of my party.  We will continue to strive for that and I hope at some stage we can have a referendum.This is truly an historic day.  It is a joyous day for so many same-sex couples throughout the country.  I convey my thanks to the organisations which campaigned so hard for this, including the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, Marriage Equality, LGBT Ireland and others.  I also thank Opposition Members for their contributions.  It is always good to have a thorough debate so that we can tease out the issues, which has happened on this occasion.It has been a good day for the Government.  I thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, for the way in which he steered the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, a very important item of legislation, through the House earlier today.  Tonight we have passed another important Bill.  Members can be assured that in the coming days further legislation from the renewed programme for Government will go through this House.  That is a sign of real progress.  It is not just about the Executive; it is also about Members opposite making a contribution.

This Bill has far-reaching consequences for more than 120,000 cohabiting couples who will find themselves in a legal web not of their own making.  When relationships break down, and inevitably they do, cohabitees will be open to maintenance and property claims similar to those that arise following a marriage break up, even when no children are involved.  Couples getting married or registering a civil partnership expressly consent to accepting legal obligations to each other, whether in a church ceremony or civil registration.  Cohabitees have chosen not to opt for either to avoid legal implications and their decision should be respected.This legislation violates the fundamental principle of consent and is an attack on personal freedom.  There is no basis to presume that legal liabilities are accepted by people living together without their express agreement.  The redress scheme may become a windfall for lawyers and we have seen enough of that with the tribunals over recent years.  Couples living together who wish to remain free of legal liabilities are being penalised by being forced to pay for legal advice and to conclude a cohabitant agreement to opt out of the legislation.  Reversing the law of normal principles, the onus to act and the legal costs are placed on those who do not wish to be covered by the redress scheme instead of those who do.It is likely that most people living together will not make cohabitant agreements.  Where no agreement exists, there is extensive scope for legal disputes over the definition of cohabitants.  The determination of relationships, arguments over financial and other contributions, claims of financial dependency and——

The great consensus in this Chamber supports the speedy passage of this legislation through the Seanad and into law.  In that respect, this is a happy day, a major landmark in terms of equality.  It is not the final battle, as Deputy Howlin mentioned.  We need a constitutional referendum so the State recognises the marriage of same-sex couples.  This is only the start but it is a happy day and I agree with my party leader, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform that this is progressive legislation that is welcomed by the vast majority of Members.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	773	I also wish Deputy Ring the best in his next position, where I am sure he will be as committed as he has been in this position.  I thank him for the contributions he has made.It is a primary aim of Údarás na Gaeltachta to reverse the downward employment trend in the Gaeltacht and to effect the transition from a declining manufacturing sector to employment in services, including Irish-language centred employment.  A total of €30 million has been allocated to Údarás na Gaeltachta from my Department's Vote for the year 2010.  Extra funding of €2 million was provided as an additional support to the organisation at the end of 2009, bringing its overall allocation to €39.6 million.  Thus, over the two year period 2009 to 2010, an t-údarás will have received almost €70 million from my Department's Vote to allow it to pursue its objectives.In addition to Exchequer voted funding, Údarás na Gaeltachta also has access to other sources of income that enable it to promote and stimulate employment creating initiatives, for example, income generated from schemes, such as the community employment scheme and the rural social scheme and income from dividends, fees and the sale and lease of assets.  Funding is also made available to an t-údarás by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation through the employment subsidy scheme and the enterprise stabilisation fund.  These supports are important to businesses in the Gaeltacht and help them to continue trading and to protect jobs. Last year, for example, these two schemes safeguarded 605 jobs.I am acutely aware of the challenges and the obstacles facing Údarás na Gaeltachta in the difficult economic environment currently being experienced at both the national and international level.  In this context, it is encouraging to note that 710 new jobs were created in údarás client-companies in the Gaeltacht in 2009.I would also draw attention to the fact that the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 is being delivered by Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas and includes measures providing direct support for investment and job creation.  Under the programme, MFG has an overall allocation of almost €17.3 million, with a specific allocation of €1.68 million for business creation and development.  Comhar na nOileán, the Leader-partnership company for island communities, most of which are in the Gaeltacht, has been allocated a total budget of  €4.6 million under the programme.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	774	I thank the Acting Chairman and the Minister for their kind remarks.Since 1997, the Government has spent more than €234 million on job creation in Gaeltacht areas.  In that time, 13,763 jobs were created and 13,730 jobs were lost.  In total, 33 jobs were sustained over 13 years at a cost of €234 million.  That is proof that new ideas are needed.We need new thinking and new policies for job creation in the Gaeltacht.  What plans has the Minister to get new thinking and new investment in the Gaeltacht?  The money we have spent over the last 13 years has been spent badly if in that time we created 33 jobs.  The Minister has to admit that job creation is not working in Gaeltacht areas.  What plans do the Minister and Údarás na Gaeltachta have to create sustainable employment in Gaeltacht areas?
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	775	I have heard Deputy Ring make these assertions before.  During the 13 year period from 1997, there were net increases in jobs in nine of these years and decreases in four years.  During that time, Údarás na Gaeltachta has replaced jobs in traditional manufacturing sectors such as textiles, knitwear and engineering sub-supply with jobs in the modern economy — media, information technology, natural resource-based companies such as aquaculture and internationally traded and tradeable services — in the face of stiff competition from more advantaged areas in Ireland and competing areas in Britain.The vast bulk of job losses occurred during the 2001 to 2003 period, when many of the international manufacturing companies, based predominantly in Gaoth Dobhair, scaled down their operations or transferred to low cost economies.  Údarás na Gaeltachta responded by attracting and supporting new companies such as Arán Pita Teo. of Largo Foods, Euroflex, RA Pacáistí Teo. and the VHI, which continue to expand and increase their workforces.The other major decrease in employment occurred in 2009, commensurate with the overall decrease in employment nationwide resulting from the downturn in the economy.  The job performance in the environment in which Údarás na Gaeltachta operates has been more than satisfactory in my view.  The average lifespan of a job in an údarás-supported project is approximately eight years.  Typically, Exchequer investment is repaid on average in approximately three years.  An average of 12% of jobs in Údarás na Gaeltachta client companies are lost as a normal part of the business cycle as sectoral trends change, enterprises restructure and companies streamline to improve their competitiveness.   It is important to point out that the employment base in the Gaeltacht is providing good value for money for the taxpayer.  Results from the annual business survey carried out by Forfás on the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta highlight the significant impact that Údarás has had on the Gaeltacht and the national economy.  The 2008 results for Údarás, which are the most recent, showed annual sales of €834 million, of which €400 million or 47.6% was in exports, which was an increase of 9.4% on the previous year.  The annual total gross pay was approximately €266 million of which €220 million was net pay or direct local economic impact.Based on these figures, the annual total tax PRSI paid to Revenue annually by Údarás client companies is €75 million, which is the most accurate reflection of value for money to the taxpayer.  A total of 43.5% of Gaeltacht companies are engaged in research and development activities, with a spend of approximately €17 million.  By any measure, these figures relating to economic impact demonstrate the exponential return the State has received from investment by Údarás na Gaeltachta in job creation in the Gaeltacht over the past number of years.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	777	I thank the Acting Chairman.I disagree with the Minister.  We have spent very badly in the Gaeltacht with regard to the amount invested and jobs created.  A number of years ago, a US company based in my constituency contacted Údarás to state it was withdrawing jobs.  Taxpayers' money was given to that company and it was allowed to keep that money to run on until after a general election took place.  That money was never paid back to the State.  I would say an agreement was reached between that company and Údarás.Call centres do not represent sustainable jobs.  What we need are new ideas and new thinking.  The Minister should not forget we have very good people in the Gaeltacht areas and in every county in the country there are people who are prepared to invest in the Gaeltacht.  As they are Irish they are not given the same opportunities as some of the US companies which we think will be great but which last a very short time.  We need to encourage our native citizens to invest in the Gaeltacht areas.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	778	Unfortunately, I have to disagree with Deputy Ring.  However, I will examine the case he cited.  The vast majority of jobs created in the Gaeltacht are spin-off jobs from larger companies.  For example, in the Connemara Gaeltacht there are many spin-off jobs from the medical devices and media areas.  The companies I cited in the Donegal Gaeltacht are, by and large, companies of Irish origin.Investment by Údarás in jobs in the Gaeltacht represents very good value for money.  The role of Údarás includes job creation but it also includes improving the general environment where the Irish language and culture can develop and can be promoted.  Central to this is creating an economic situation which allows people who live in the Gaeltacht to remain in the Gaeltacht.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	779	As the Deputy is aware, the local development social inclusion programme and the community development programme were my Department's two main social inclusion and community development programmes.  These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the local and community development programme.  A key difference between the new local and community development programme and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.Under the new programme, local development companies and community development projects continuing in the programme are required to identify and meet the needs of their communities and I have asked that particular attention be given to RAPID areas and to those areas where community development programmes no longer operate.  As I have outlined in the past, my overall aim is to ensure that, notwithstanding the difficult budgetary position, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme and better integrated actions.  As previously indicated, my primary concern in this most difficult economic climate is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by or supported through my Department, especially those focused on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities, are protected and to minimise overheads and ancillary costs.  My Department will continue to work to that end with Pobal and the local development and community groups involved.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	780	I wish to be associated with the remarks made with regard to Deputy Ring.  He is going on to greener pastures and I wish him well.  He has been a great advocate of the community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs brief and he will be missed in that regard.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	781	Thank you.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	782	The Minister is from Kerry and he can sidestep better than many people.  In that reply he gave me the best sidestep I ever saw a Kerryman give anyone because he did not answer the question.  Not one word was with regard to the question.  I asked what has been done where funding has been withdrawn from particular community development programme areas.  I am afraid there was nothing in the answer on that.Groups did not get funding, for whatever reason.  There is a need to look at these areas to see what can be done.  I trust the Minister to see whether something can be done.  Perhaps they can be covered by the new programme.  However, just because they did not qualify for funding they should not be ignored.  Good work was done in those areas.  Will the Minister look at the files and see whether something can be done and perhaps at a later stage we can ask about it again?  I am concerned about a shortfall and I want to know there will not be one with regard to existing facilities.  Everyone involved in those community development programmes sought to do good.While I am on my feet I will ask the Minister whether there is agreement on the new proposal.  Where does it stand?  How many groups have signed up to it?  Has an overall national plan been agreed?  Proposals were made with regard to specific groups seeking to sign up to a national plan but others did not agree with that.  Will the Minister provide the House with an overview on where we stand now?
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I will give a very direct answer to Deputy Wall this time.  I meant to do so first time and I hope I did so.  It is not my intention, it is not the Department's intention and I certainly do not think it was my predecessor's intention to have any diminution in the intensity and vigour of community development work in this country.  I do not want to see that happen.  I acknowledge and recognise the superb work being done throughout the country by many projects, including community development projects.  However, the vast majority of these interventions have been in existence for the best part of 20 years.  Any intervention in the community development area or any area that is not prepared to look at itself, have itself examined and evaluate whether it is doing the job that is appropriate to today has questions to answer.  These projects were very appropriate when they were established in the 1980s.  The vast majority of them that were able to evolve over that period are still very relevant.I visited a number of projects in recent weeks.  In Cork, I saw community development projects that were the drivers of development.  They made very good interventions.  Unfortunately, elsewhere in the country I saw community development projects that had become isolated from some innovative work.  To answer the Deputy's question, I do not want to see any group that feels it has been doing very good work to be thrown to the four winds.  The Department has always stated it will assist in whatever way it can to try to help those projects that perhaps did not meet the standard set by the Department and its evaluators as centres for effective services.On the question on whether there is agreement now, there is not total agreement by any means.  The majority of groups has seen the merit of going down the integration route.  There are a number of models.I met a number of people who were able to tell me that in different parts of the country interest models were beginning to evolve.  As the Deputy is aware, last night was the cut-off point for those groups to sign up.  I was very conscious of the fact that if I gave any indication of a model I favoured early on, everybody would run after it.  There are a number of them in different parts of the country.  Members in this House from all parties have suggested to me that there are models of potentially good practice.Over the next weeks and months my officials and I will be working out how we can make the best impact on people's lives because ultimately, this is about having an impact in, by and large, marginalised and disadvantaged communities throughout the country, whether they are urban or rural.  It has to be done.  They will in time become part of a very effective overall plan.  There will be some teething problems and bedding down will be needed but the essence of the model and the approach that has been taken is the correct one for the moment.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	784	I pray that the Minister will not ignore those who have not signed up.  There was a deadline.  This has required a lot of examination.  I ask the Minister that if someone feels he or she is hard done by and has not met the deadline that the Minister would consider the case and give them an opportunity to apply, but not next September.  If a person wants to apply he or she should do so now and be given an opportunity.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	785	As I said in an interview recently which has been broadcast, to continue the sports analogy I am prepared to allow a little bit of injury time, in terms of days rather than stringing it out for several weeks.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	786	As the Deputy is aware, my Department is responsible for the delivery of axes 3 and 4 of the rural development programme 2007-13 for which overall funding of the order of €425 million is available.  The main objectives of the programme are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy.  The individual measures under the programme, including the indicative funds available, are as follows: diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families- €16.66 million; support for business creation and development — €48.26 million; encouragement of tourism activities — €45.4 million; basic services for the economy and rural population — €49.61 million; village renewal and development — €54.2 million; conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage — €51.7 million; training and information on adapted and new skills — €29.45 million; and  implementing co-operation projects — €10.7 million.There are 36 local action groups contracted on my Department's behalf to deliver the rural development programme throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers on the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the individual group's local development strategy and in line with my Department's operating rules and European Union regulations.  In terms of funding, €27 million was made available to the groups in 2009 and the allocation under the programme in 2010 is €40 million.  This year's allocation represents an increase of approximately 120% on expenditure in 2009.The Deputy will be aware that it is imperative, particularly in the current economic climate, that the rural development programme maximises the funding available for the programme in local areas, in order to ensure the improvement of the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy.  With this in mind, I recently announced that the groups are free to enter into commitments up to the value of €40 million for 2011.  In announcing this initial allocation for next year, I urged the groups to focus their energies on supporting projects that will bring jobs and real and sustainable growth to communities across rural Ireland and I am confident that the availability of this initial €40 million allocation for 2011 will allow the groups to do this.To support them in the roll-out of the programme, my Department is working very closely with individual groups to ensure efficient and effective delivery.  It is also worth noting that I and the Minister of State, Deputy White, intend to meet with all the groups during July to discuss progress and emerging opportunities and also to address any difficulties that they have encountered in the ongoing delivery of the programme.  I am confident that groups will continue to serve their local communities by ensuring that all available funding is spent so as to maximise the impact of the programme in their areas.The following table outlines the allocations and the spend in each group.Local Action GroupOverall Programme Allocation 2007-2013Funding delivered to Date Jun-10Proportion of overall allocation€€%Avondhu/ Blackwater Partnership Limited9,057,810961,627.8711Ballyhoura Development Limited11,673,5191,278,904.5811Carlow County Development Partnership Limited8,878,177554,913.076Cavan Part & County Monaghan Area Part12,035,118462,741.844Clare Local Development Company Limited14,028,5291,063,707.288Comhar na nOileáin Teoranta4,642,415376,302.238Donegal Local Development Company Limited12,831,901925,420.877Fingal LEADER Partnership7,766,780400,547.735FORUM Connemara9,668,965334,339.143Galway Rural Development Company Limited15,257,9851,000,342.227Inishowen Development Partnership8,286,143619,081.427I.R.D.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	787	I tabled some parliamentary questions on this matter.  In his reply the Minister said €40 million is allocated for this year but we are halfway through the year and the most recent reply I received stated €9 million has been drawn down so far.  Some of the groups told me they are having difficulty in accessing the funding from the Leader programme.  Will the full €40 million be drawn down for this year, particularly given the current economic difficulties in the country?  It is very important that as much of that funding as possible can be spread around the country to try to create badly needed jobs.  Is the Minister happy that the Exchequer funding will be in place for this year and for the duration of the programme from 2007-13?  It is very important that it is, as well as the European funding which can be matched by it, in place.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	788	To answer the last question first, I am happy that will happen.  To broaden the debate, the Minister of State, Deputy White, and I have been discussing concerns Deputy Ring and others have brought to our attention about difficulties that clients of Leader companies seem to be encountering.  Over the past number of weeks we have been in discussions with our officials and others to see where we can identify best practice and where the difficulties are.  Access to credit is one of them, about that there is no doubt.  We had some useful meetings in recent weeks at which we asked the officials to explore how that difficulty can be overcome.  When we meet the groups in the middle of July we hope we will be able to encourage and support them in trying to get through the different aspects of that difficulty.I have spoken to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy O'Keeffe.  There are great ideas being circulated but there has been a difficulty in drawing down funding.  I spoke to a senior official in charge of the programme yesterday and I gather that, for whatever reason, there is an improved flow of funds going out at this stage.  The approval of the Department of Finance is for €40 million next year and required an assurance from us that we could deliver the spending of it.  I am fairly confident that will be the case because the potential of the programmes is enormous and can have a transformational effect in rural communities.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	789	I am glad the Minister, Deputy Carey, and the Minister of State, Deputy White, are aware of the problems.  They are correct to say that there are some wonderful ideas in circulation.  I agree with them on the issue of credit.  The banks have to play their part and support the people who are prepared to take a risk.On the question of funding, I have been critical of the previous Leader programmes.  I do not want to be hypocritical and say we allowed people to draw down funding without due care.  That has to be done as we all have to protect the taxpayer's money.  At the same time I am glad the Minister and the Minister of State have had meetings with their officials and the Leader companies.  I ask them to revert to these companies.  There are some very good ideas in my county and people from other parts of the country come to me to tell me they have good ideas.  They want to create employment in rural areas.We need to try to get credit flowing from the banks if possible, through the Minister for Finance, and the Leaders companies need to speed up to try to get the decisions made on applications.  It is important.  We need to create as many jobs as possible.  I believe in the bottom up approach.  If we do not create them in rural areas it will not happen.  It is important to support local communities.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	790	Deputy Ring is correct.  We are anxious to address those blockages.  When he examines the table on spend and allocation, he will find while there is a feeling that more could be spent the vast majority of companies are spending an average figure for this stage of the programme, bearing in mind that this will continue beyond 2013.  There is a two year roll-over period.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	791	As the Deputy will be aware, the scheme of housing grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts was suspended with effect from 7 April 2009 due to the high level of commitments and the large number of applications on hand.  However, applications for new house grants under the scheme were accepted up to 15 June 2009 on condition that the applicants had full planning permission on or before 7 April 2009.  While my Department is continuing to process all housing applications that were approved or on hand prior to suspension of the scheme, there is no plan at present to reintroduce the housing grant scheme in the Gaeltacht.In general terms, the draft 20 year strategy for Irish envisages significant changes in the definition of the Gaeltacht and emphasises the need for language planning and sociolinguistic interventions.  I anticipate that the effectiveness of the Gaeltacht housing scheme and other Gaeltacht and Irish language schemes will be considered in that context at the appropriate time.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	792	This was a good scheme.  I am aware there is a shortage of funds at present but, like Deputy McGinley and others, I regularly deal with constituents from Gaeltacht areas.  This scheme helped young couples to build homes in Gaeltacht areas and elderly people to make their homes safe and warm.  Mr. McCarthy called for the abolition of the scheme but he does not live in a bad house in a rural or Gaeltacht area.  I urge the Minister to engage the Department of Finance with a view to introducing a limited scheme in the next budget to assist the elderly.  I recognise the scheme may not be fully reinstated but the elderly are particularly deserving.  The quality of people's homes have improved over the 16 years in which I have represented Gaeltacht areas, partly thanks to this scheme.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I agree with Deputy Ring but in case people think nothing is happening, the 250 applications that are currently awaiting a decision will add approximately €1.5 million to our existing commitment of €4.533 million.  Of the allocation of €2 million for 2010, some €1.7 million has been spent.  I agree it is a good scheme but it will take an estimated three to four years to pay out all the grants.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance on this and other matters.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	797	Tá áthas orm a chur in iúl don Teachta go bhfuil socruithe déanta agam casadh le Bord Údarás na Gaeltachta roimh dheireadh na míosa seo.Maidir le cúrsaí airgeadais an Údaráis, tá soláthar iomlán de bheagnach €30 milliún curtha ar fáil don eagraíocht trí Vóta mo Roinne don bhliain 2010.  Ní mór a chur san áireamh chomh maith gur ag deireadh 2009 a cuireadh méadú de €2 mhilliún leis an mbunsoláthar de €35.6 milliún a bhí i Meastacháin 2009, mar thacaíocht bhreise don eagraíocht.  Ciallaíonn sé sin go mbeidh soláthar iomlán de bheagnach €68 milliún curtha ar fáil ag mo Roinnse don Údarás sa tréimhse 2009-10 chun a chuid spriocanna maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur i gcrích.Ní mór a chur san áireamh freisin go mbíonn teacht ag an Údarás ar fhoinsí ioncaim eile, ar a n-áirítear ioncam ó fheidhmiú scéimeanna ar nós na Scéimeanna Fostaíochta Pobail agus Sóisialta Tuaithe, agus ioncam ó dhíol nó léasáil socmhainní, ó dhíbhinní agus ó tháillí.  Chomh maith leis seo, cuirtear maoiniú ar fáil don Údarás tríd an Roinn Fiontair, Trádála agus Nuálaíochta chun an Scéim Fóirdheontas Fostaíochta agus an Ciste Cobhsaíochta Fiontar a fheidhmiú.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag na tacaíochtaí seo do chomhlachtaí sa Ghaeltacht chun cuidiú leo leanúint ag trádáil agus poist a choinneáil slán.  Anuraidh, mar shampla, thacaigh an dá scéim seo le caomhnú 605 post Gaeltachta.De réir na reachtaíochta faoina bhfeidhmíonn an tÚdarás i láthair na huaire, ní mór toghchán a reáchtáil taobh istigh de thréimhsí nach giorra ná ceithre bliana agus nach faide ná cúig bliana go leith ó dháta an toghcháin deiridh.  Reachtáladh toghchán deireadh an Údaráis ar 2 Aibreán 2005 agus, dá bhrí sin, bheadh an chéad toghchán eile le reáchtáil roimh 1 Deireadh Fómhair 2010.Mar is eol don Teachta, tá leasuithe maidir le cumhachtaí, feidhmeanna agus struchtúr Údarás na Gaeltachta á meas faoi láthair i gcomhthéacs na moltaí atá sa dréacht-Straitéis 20-Bliain don Ghaeilge, atá faoi bhreithniú ag an Chomhchoiste um Ghnóthaí Ealaíon, Spóirt, Turasóireachta, Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta.  Táthar dóchasach go mbeidh obair an Chomhchoiste i ndáil leis an Stráitéis curtha i gcrích go luath agus tá súil agam, ach cead an Rialtais a bheith faighte, go mbeidh dul chun cinn suntasach bainte amach maidir le foilsiú na Straitéise faoi Mheán Fómhair seo chugainn.  Beifear ábalta ina dhiaidh sin díriú isteach ar an bpróiseas maidir le reachtaíocht an Údaráis a leasú.San idirlinn, meastar go bhfuil sé inmholta dáta an toghcháin a chur siar chun deis a thabhairt an próiseas atá luaite agam a chríochniú.  Chuige sin, foilsíodh an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) 2010 chun síneadh a chur leis an uas-thréimshe idir thoghcháin ó chúig bliana go leith go dtí seacht mbliana go leith.  Tógadh an Bille sa Seanad an tseachtain seo caite agus tuigim go mbeidh sé le tógáil sa Dáil an tseachtain seo chugainn.  Le hachtú an Bhille seo, bheadh an dáta deiridh do thoghchán an Údaráis sínte amach go dtí 30 Meán Fómhair 2012.

I know I have the support of the Acting Chairman and of his parish priest.Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire chun bualadh le bord Údaras na Gaeltachta níos moille an mhí seo.  Tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh an bord ina luí ar an Aire an ghéarchéim agus an easpa misnigh atá in Údarás na Gaeltacht i láthair na huaire mar gheall ar easpa acmhainní.  An bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil foireann an údaráis ag 100 anois?  Bhí 120 nó 130 ann uair.  An dtuigeann an tAire go bhfuil feidhmeannaigh sinsearacha, senior executives, ag fágáil an údaráis seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine agus nach bhfuil éinne ag teacht chun a n-áit a thógáil de thairbhe an bhaic earcaíochta, the recruitment ban?  Tá sin ag cur isteach ar an údarás agus ar a chuid oibre.  An mbeidh an tAire ag déanamh iarrachta na daoine a fhágfaidh a bpost, daoine eile a chur ina n-áit sa dóigh is gur féidir leis an údarás a chuid oibre a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí?
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	803	Chomh luath agus a bheidh an tuarascáil agam ón choiste, i gceann seachtaine nó coicíse, déanfaidh an Rialtas scrúdú ar impleachtaí na moltaí d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Síneadh téarma fostaíochta an phríomhfheidhmeannaigh go dtí deireadh na bliana seo.  Tá níos lú daoine fostaithe san údarás ná mar a bhíodh ach tá laghdú ar líon na ndaoine atá fostaithe i ngach cuid den earnáil phoiblí.  Is féidir jab maith a dhéanamh leis an méid atá ag obair faoi láthair san údarás agus tá jab an-mhaith á dhéanamh acu.Beidh mé ag bualadh leis an bhord agus beidh suim agam fáil amach cad iad na pleananna a theastaíonn ón údarás féin, cén ról atá oiriúnach dó.  Sa dréachtstraitéis, tá athrú ar an ról.  Níl a fhios agam an aontaíonn gach duine ar an fhochoiste ach gan a thuilleadh a rá faoi cad tá i ndán don údarás, beidh ról lárnach tábhachtach ann dó.  Seans go mbeidh athrú treo ann, beag nó mór, ach beidh athrú ann gan amhras, cé go mbeidh ról lárnach ag an údarás ag cothú agus ag leathnú cúrsaí Gaeilge agus cúrsaí Gaeltachta idir cultúr, teanga agus fostaíochta.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	806	Scéim labhairt na Gaeilge was first introduced in 1935 when an annual grant was available to each school-going child for the purpose of encouraging households in the Gaeltacht to use Irish as their everyday language.The scheme in its current form is in operation since 1993.  While it is a mechanism for supporting and promoting Irish as a living household and community language in the Gaeltacht, it can also be seen as representing Government support for the Gaeltacht at a time when the language is facing a major threat due to a number of different factors which have been identified in the linguistic study on the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  The scheme also provides data on the strength of the language in the various Gaeltacht regions.A review of the scheme was carried out in 2003-04 and some basic changes to make it more relevant to today's needs were recommended. However, because of the cost involved, these were not proceeded with at the time.As I indicated, the draft 20 year strategy for Irish envisages significant changes to the definition of the Gaeltacht and the need for significant emphasis in the future on language planning and socio-linguistic interventions.  I anticipate that the effectiveness of scéim labhairt na Gaeilge and other Gaeltacht and Irish language schemes will fall to be considered in that context at the appropriate time.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	807	As the Minister stated, scéim labhairt na Gaeilge has been operational in the Gaeltacht since 1935.  For 75 years it has been part and parcel of the educational system in the Gaeltacht where it is administered through schools.  Does the Minister agree that the format of the scheme has outlived its usefulness and probably does not accurately reflect the standard of Irish in the Gaeltacht or the extent to which it is spoken in the Gaeltacht?  Does he also agree that unfortunately many schools in the Gaeltacht do not submit applications under the scheme?  This has implications for the language.  Will he outline what were the recommendations of the review group?  Is an estimate available as to how much it would cost the Exchequer to implement the recommendations?
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	808	The main recommendations were that the scheme would be applicable to new households from the time the first child is born — the main criticism of the scheme is that it only comes into operation when the first child in the family starts attending school, which is too late in terms of language acquisition; support services for learning or improving the Irish language would be available to households; an agreement or understanding would be made between the Department and household regarding the promotion of the language; and the grant would be increased.I tend to concur with Deputy McGinley.  The environment for supporting the Irish language has changed.  Having met representatives of parents with young children from inside and outside the Gaeltacht who are anxious to raise their families through the medium of Irish, I consider that it should be possible to support families when children are at an early age.  The problem with some of the schemes in place is that they kick in too late.  By the time a child is four or five years old and of school-going age, he or she will have missed critical opportunities to acquire language skills.  There is considerable merit in working with pre-school children at naoínraí and their parents to conserve and promote the Irish language.As some Deputies will know better than I do, a number of initiatives are under way, for example, in Indreabhán and elsewhere in Connemara and in the west Kerry Gaeltacht, to deliver significant inter-agency support to families.  This includes support from the Health Service Executive, an agency that is not often spoken about positively, which is providing speech and language therapy services as Gaeilge in a family resource centre.  We should examine other ways of supporting the language, although I do not exclude supports that are currently available.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	810	Yes.

Latin survives as a dead language because there are no native speakers.  We do not want Irish to suffer the same fate as Latin.  The main benefit of the scheme was in this area.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	812	While I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy, we need to support those who have chosen to live in the Gaeltacht.  Increasingly, both parents will not be native Irish speakers or speak Irish as their first language, if it all.  We need to support this group of people.  I visited a two teacher school in west Kerry recently and if what I observed there could be replicated elsewhere, the language would be in a great state.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	813	Do I understand that families who originate in the Gaeltacht and are living outside the Gaeltacht or families who genuinely bring their children up through the medium of Irish outside the Gaeltacht could be considered in the context of scéim labhairt na Gaeilge?  A number of times tonight the Minister mentioned the change in the definition of a Gaeltacht.  I take it that is moving towards the boundaries of the Gaeltacht also changing.  Where that might happen, there could be some families who genuinely bring up their children through Irish but are in a minority.  Would it be fair with the new definition of the Gaeltacht and changed boundaries to exclude them from the scheme?
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	814	I have not even addressed the issue of boundary changes yet.  The Deputy knows what the strategy states and reports have been written in that regard.  There are two groups.  We need to support and conserve Irish in the Gaeltacht areas.  However, there is an emerging group, maybe around the scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge, who are increasingly using Irish as their first language, but very often they need support.  I would envisage that in the context of implementing the 20-year strategy, measures would be made available to those new groups as well as groups within the Gaeltacht through a form of the scéim labhartha.  I believe it will take different forms.  When the pleananna Ghaeilge are formalised — there are a number of interesting ones in different parts of the country emerging already and are almost ready to roll and it is a pity we have not been able to get discussion on this under way more quickly, but we are where we are — and put into effect, different interventions will emerge.  Organisations like Foras na Gaeilge and others will form part of support services that will be — and should be — available to families.  Some of us present are teachers or former teachers.  By starting early we are likely to have a greater impact in whatever language it is.In the school I mentioned, there was a ten year old girl of Swiss origin.  She had been in the school for only a short time and because of the approach taken to the teaching of Irish in that school, she certainly had better Irish than I have.

Tuigtear dom go mbeidh tuairisc an chomhchoiste ar fáil go luath agus tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas brú ar aghaidh ansin le cead an Rialtais a lorg chun an straitéis a fhoilsiú. Mar a thuigfidh an Teachta, go dtí go mbeidh an próiseas sin críochnaithe, tá sé deacair amscála cinnte a lua ach bheinn dóchasach go mbeidh dul chun cinn suntasach bainte amach faoi Mheán Fómhair seo chugainn.Mar a bhí molta sa staidéar teangeolaíoch ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, cuimsíonn an dréacht-straitéis forbairt córais pleanála teanga chuimsithigh ag leibhéal an phobail sa Ghaeltacht.

Blianta ó shin, bhí Gaeilge ag gach éinne sa Ghaeltacht, ach anois b'fhéidir go bhfuil teaghlaigh measctha ann ina bhfuil Gaeilge ag an athair agus Béarla ag an mháthair, nó an dóigh eile.  Cothaíonn seo deacrachtaí.  An aontódh an tAire go mbeadh fiúntas i scéim a chuirfeadh daoine speisialta ar fáil chun cabhair a thabhairt do theaghlaigh ina bhfuil an dá theanga sa teach, fá choinne cuidiú leis na páistí feabhas a chur ar an teanga?

I láthair na huaire tá mo Roinn ag comhoibriú le pobail eile atá ag iarraidh tabhairt faoi a leithéid a fhorbairt ina gceantair féin.  Táthar ag súil go mbeidh dul chun cinn suntasach déanta i gcásanna eile amach anseo freisin.  Ar ndóigh, is ó na pobail féin a thagann na héilimh i leith seirbhísí den saghas seo agus tá oifigigh na Roinne ar fáil i gcónaí chun comhairle a thabhairt.  Fiú inniu, bhí mé i dteagmháil le m'oifigigh mar gheall ar ionad den tsórt seo in áit eile sa tír.  Maidir le feidhmeannaigh teanga, níl aon fheidhmeannach fostaithe go díreach, ach cuireann mo Roinn cúnamh ar fáil d'eagraíochtaí atá ag plé le pleanáil teanga sa Ghaeltacht, le iad a cumasú chun seirbhísí airithe a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge.  Déantar a leithéid go hiondúil i gcomhar le heagraíochtaí eile Stáit i gcomhthéacs plean teanga i bpobail láidre Gaeilge.  Clúdaíonn an dréachtstraitéis córas pleanála teanga cuimsitheach i ngach ceantar Gaeltachta.

To date, 100 staff have moved to interim accommodation in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, where a significant number of the business units of my Department, including the full rural, community and financial business units, are now operating efficiently and effectively in two properties, which are being leased by the OPW on behalf of my Department.In December 2009, in light of budgetary constraints and affordability issues, the Minister for Finance decided to defer proceeding with permanent accommodation in Charlestown at this time.This location, along with four other deferred projects, will be considered as part of an overall review of the decentralisation programme in 2011.  The Deputy will also be aware that under the decentralisation programme, ten staff of my Department were due to decentralise to Na Forbacha, County Galway, and I can confirm that this process has now been completed.With regard to bodies funded from my Department's Vote group, I can advise that in line with the decentralisation programme, 25 staff have relocated with Pobal to offices in Clifden, County Galway; Foras na Gaeilge is in the process of relocating five staff to Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal; 16 staff have decentralised to offices in Roscrea, County Tipperary, with the Equality Authority; and ten staff have relocated to interim accommodation in Portlaoise, County Laois, with the Equality Tribunal, which is due to relocate to Portarlington, County Laois.  Each of these projects will be considered further as part of the overall review of the decentralisation programme in 2011.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	825	It seems the Department is so fragmented now it will be difficult to take in all the elements.  We see some sections of the Department of Social Protection working well in Sligo and Letterkenny, etc.  The big question is whether it is feasible that the Department, given the fragmentation outlined by the Minister, can work as cohesively as those sections in the Department of Social Protection.  In the development of the Department, how do the staff involved travel from Tubbercurry or the seven areas mentioned by the Minister?  Is that an extra cost on the Department that would not be there under normal circumstances?I get wonderful service from the Department of Social Protection in Longford, Sligo and Letterkenny and I could have no crib about the way the system works.  Can the Minister's Department work under similar circumstances?  The Department of Social Protection deals mainly in payments but the Minister's Department is different as it deals with development programmes and there would be a greater number of meetings.  The Minister and Minister of State can outline these issues.I am considering staff efficiency so does the Minister feel the decentralisation exercise will be a success?  I agree with the theme of decentralisation.  Does the Minister, having been in office for a period, agree with me?  Does he envisage any problems or know of existing problems?  As the process has stalled, can something be done before we move the sections to their final positions?
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	826	We are a small Department, although it has increased in size  — more or less doubling — over the past number of weeks.  Much has been done in the Department to make it lean and efficient, and one of the most progressive aspects has been the Department's investment in ICT.  Most meetings are conducted through video conferencing, with officials, the Minister of State and I conducting many meetings, including those with delegations, through video conferencing.  There is little travel involved, although it happens from time to time when senior officials in a unit may come to Dublin or travel from Tubbercurry to Na Forbacha.By and large, most of the work is conducted using video conferencing which I encourage other Departments to adopt if they work from dispersed locations throughout the country.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy White, and I have been impressed at the capacity to conduct very effective meetings in that way.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	827	The decentralisation programme outlined by the Minister and commented on by Deputy Wall is farcical.  There is a development in Kiltimagh and I ask the Minister to look at that facility to see if it is suitable for decentralisation, even on a short-term basis, until the site in Charlestown has been bought and developed with the required planning permission.The Minister has said there is no cost factor but there must be a cost for the renting of property and bringing staff from all the different parts of the country.  I ask the Minister to look at the site in Kiltamagh in County Mayo and try to bring all staff into one location.  Much State investment has gone into the site, although it is owned by a private company, IRD.  It is prepared to rent it or give it to the State on the basis that the State would maintain it just to get jobs into County Mayo.  Will the Minister consider having a look at the site?

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	829	I am aware of the property mentioned by Deputy Ring and he is probably aware of the correspondence between myself and the property owners involved.  I do not want to raise false hopes as that would be unfair.  We believe that pending the outcome of the review of the future development of decentralisation, what is available to us in Tubbercurry is very cost-effective and I can give the Deputy and the House full details of the precise cost of each location.  I assure Deputies costs are kept to an absolute minimum and it is a lesson in how cost effectively a Department can be run, either in a Dublin location or elsewhere.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	830	Does Deputy Wall want ten seconds to ask a question?  If he were sitting here he would say the same to me.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	831	I sat down one night because the Chairman told me I only had ten seconds in which to speak.  I said I would not waste time on the matter.Where is the final resting place of the Minister of State, Deputy White, in the Department?  Where does she operate from and have all the t's been crossed and i's dotted in the change in the Department taking in responsibility for equality affairs from the Department of Justice and Law Reform?
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	832	The question is where is the Minister of State's resting place.  I do not know if that is what the Deputy meant.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy White, understands the tone of the question.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	834	The new Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs is based on Mespil Road and the Deputy is very welcome to visit it.  I am based there in a wonderful Department and we are all in one place, having moved from the relevant sections in the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  We have a new Minister in Deputy Carey, a new Secretary General and I am new in the position as Minister of State so we are now complete.  That is where we are currently operating.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	837	The Chair is the Minister's hands and those of the Members.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	838	I shudder to think.  As indicated previously to the House, I wish to confirm that my Department keeps the work of implementing the Official Languages Act 2003 under continuing review.  Furthermore, there is an obligation on me, as Minister, to review the operation of the Act each year, as provided for in section 5 of the Act, and to report formally to the Houses of the Oireachtas in that regard.  The reports for the years to 2009 are available in the Oireachtas Library.Whereas I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation, on a phased basis, of the provisions of the Act, I agree with the view expressed by my predecessor that it will not be possible to achieve everything overnight.  I can again confirm that I am committed to the implementation of the Official Languages Act and to the achievement of its objectives.  Indeed, the implementation of the Act is one of the principles set out in the Government's policy statement on the Irish language, issued in December 2006, which forms the basis of the draft 20-year strategy for Irish, which was published in November 2009.  The draft has been under consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sports, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and I hope to receive the report shortly.I am also committed to ensuring that the Act be implemented in as cost-effective a way as possible, particularly having regard to the current economic climate.  My Department will continue to approach these matters in a realistic, flexible and pragmatic way, especially in agreeing statutory language schemes.  In this context, a significant number of resources are already in place to assist public bodies in meeting their obligations as cost effectively as possible.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	839	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  The Minister stated that a review of the Act is being undertaken by the Department.  The Act has been in place since 2003.  Is it not time to examine how effective implementation of the Act has been in terms of what is the most important issue at the end of the day, namely, the use of the Irish language, in particular people speaking it?  Considerable money is being spent on implementing the Act.  There are documents being produced in the Irish language that are virtually unread.  For instance, not many people read county development plans much less an Irish version of them.  As development plans are important in terms of the planning process they must be accurately translated in order that people can use them.Are we getting the best value from the resources being applied to implementation of the Official Languages Act?  Could, for instance, that money be better used elsewhere to achieve other objectives?  I am not convinced that implementation of the Act is value for money or is achieving anything in terms of the revival and wider use of the Irish language.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	840	I understand what the Deputy is saying.  However, as regards translation costs and so on, it has been pointed out by my predecessor on several occasions that the Act does not require that all documents be translated into Irish.  It provides that only a number of key documents shall be published in each of the official languages.  The question of costs since the Act was introduced in 2003 was addressed in a reply on 3 February.  Of the 15 Departments of State, 11 replied.  It is estimated by my Department that the average direct cost amounted to approximately €600,000 per annum or approximately €55,000 per Department.  I am of the view that no fair minded person would consider these costs excessive or unreasonable.  I also believe that public bodies, particularly in regard to the translation of documents can, as Deputy O'Shea said, achieve greater cost effectiveness.  This could be secured by planning earlier in the process for translation, greater use of standardised templates for documents such as annual reports, which are available, and publication by way of CD or the Internet rather than hard copy.The development by Foras na Gaeilge of a number of support services, including the roll-out of the accreditation system for translators and the development of an Irish language translation memory resource for public bodies will also assist in ensuring public bodies receive a translation product that is reliable and meets a high standard.  I do not support the view that money is not being wisely spent in respect of implementation of the Official Languages Act.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	841	I agree with Deputy O'Shea.  I believe that a directive should go out to local authorities and State agencies in regard to uploading documents onto their websites owing to the cost involved.There is a major problem in respect of signage, in particular in Gaeltacht areas where signs are displayed in Irish only.  In every county on the way to Gaeltacht areas, including in my own county, signs displaying place names in Irish have been painted over and the English version of the place name has been inserted.  Perhaps by way of the review of the Official Languages Act consideration might be given to signs being bilingual, with the place name in Irish the bigger of the two, I do not mind.  This matter needs to be addressed.  We are making a fool of ourselves and the countryside is being destroyed with people painting over signs displayed in Irish and this is causing problems for tourists and tourism in Gaeltacht areas.  A man, a fluent Irish speaker, told me he is losing business as a result of the new signage.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	842	I am aware of the issue raised by Deputy Ring.  Local authorities are responsible for road and other signage in their areas.  The guidelines in terms of what should be displayed on signs is clearly established.  The obligations of the Official Languages Act must also be complied with.  That being said, we would always encourage that sensible and pragmatic approaches be taken in this regard.  Enactment of the Official Languages Act in July 2003 was an important statement.  The Act is underpinned by legislation and Supreme Court findings and I would not tamper with it easily.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	843	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 15, 23, 46 and 49 together.As Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, I see headshops and the psychoactive substances they sell as representing a relatively new aspect of the ever-evolving issue of substance misuse in our society.  I am determined, as are my Government colleagues, to tackle the problems arising and to pursue all available approaches to counter the potential threats involved.The steps taken by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney,  in May in introducing regulations under the Misuse of Drugs Acts have had a significant impact.  These regulations make the possession and sale of more than 200 products subject to criminal sanctions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  The introduction of controls sent out a clear message, in particular to young people, about the dangers of psychoactive substances sold through headshops and via the Internet.  It also places Ireland to the fore in the context of the control of new psychoactive substances in EU countries.Prior to the introduction of these controls, the Garda Síochána had identified 102 headshop outlets.  The number subsequently fell to 34, although some have since re-opened.  Given the evidence at a global level, it was expected that efforts would be made to source alternative substances to put on sale both in headshops and through the Internet.  The Minister for Health and Children is monitoring this situation with a view to controlling further substances under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, if that proves to be necessary.Against this background, the Government approved proposals from the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for a Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill.  I strongly believe that this legislation, together with the Misuse of Drugs Act, will provide a comprehensive legislative response to the psychoactive substances and headshop issues.  Under the provisions of the Bill, it will be a criminal offence to sell or supply substances that are not prohibited under the Misuse of Drugs Act, but that have psychoactive effects on humans.  In addition, the proposed legislation will make it an offence to sell objects for cultivation by hydroponic means, thus tackling another aspect of drug production.  A further critical feature of the Bill is the significant powers envisaged for the Garda Síochána.  The Bill has been debated in the Seanad and is scheduled for Second Stage debate in the Dáil tomorrow.With regard to the level of my interaction and that of my officials with the Garda Síochána, there is ongoing engagement with the Garda through the structures established under the National Drugs Strategy.  These include the Oversight Forum on Drugs, the Drugs Advisory Group, and periodic meetings with the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner, as provided for under the strategy.  Apart from such organised structures, I am in contact with representatives of the Garda Síochána on an ongoing basis in relation to various drugs issues.  I would also point out that the gardaí are involved as members of the 24 drugs task forces across the country and I want to acknowledge their input in this regard.Meanwhile, the activities of headshops are being closely monitored on an ongoing basis by the Garda Síochána and Revenue's customs service with a view to ensuring that no illegal substances are being sold.  The HSE, in association with partner agencies under the drugs strategy, is finalising a national drugs awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of psychoactive substances.  I will launch that campaign next week.  The national advisory committee on drugs is also carrying out some targeted research in this area and relevant Government agencies are reviewing existing legislative provisions to establish if headshops are in compliance with the provisions applying.I assure the Deputies that I will continue to work with my ministerial colleagues in vigorously pursuing all viable approaches to counter the threats posed by headshops and the products they sell.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	844	I will allow a brief supplementary question from Deputies Ring and Wall.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	845	Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010 will be before the House tomorrow and it is hoped the Bill will be passed before the summer recess.Will there be anything in the legislation to deal with that?  Some 48 head shops are open at present.  What levels of resources are being given to the Garda and the HSE to make sure the new products that are introduced on a daily basis are dealt with?
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	846	The excellent document produced by Drugnet shows what we are fighting against.  I support what Deputy Ring is saying.  I ask that these head shops be kept under constant surveillance so that all new products are dealt with.  It is clear from the Drugnet document that these products are changing on a daily basis.  If we are to protect the youngsters who frequent these establishments, we have to ensure that constant surveillance results in these products being banned.  I appreciate the efforts that have been made to date to ban these substances.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I understand that the possibility of exploiting the Internet for the sale and purchase of these products is to be severely restricted.  The inclusion in the list of banned products of "whack" and "amplified", both of which are derivatives of previous products, shows that the measures which have been introduced to date are working.  I suggest that our legislation is very effective.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	848	Seanad Éireann has passed the European Financial Stability Facility Bill 2010 without amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	849	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Joan Burton — the withdrawal of English language support teachers from Mary Mother of Hope Senior School, Littlepace, Clonee, Dublin 15; (2) Deputy Pat Breen — the future of the newly refurbished dementia unit at St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis and the need for the Minister for Health and Children to lift the moratorium on employment in the public service to allow for the filling of the positions required so this facility can open immediately; (3) Deputy Shane McEntee — the dramatic impact of the withdrawal of the EirGrid planning application for a 58 km 400kV power line between Woodland, County Meath and Kingscourt, County Cavan on the oral public hearing process, the company having spent almost €20 million preparing it over a three-year period; (4) Deputy Leo Varadkar — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to account to the House for the HSE decision to impose funding cuts of almost 10% on the Daughters of Charity in north-east Dublin, which will result in the closure of respite care, day school, summer camp and other services for the intellectually disabled, and the need for the Minister to mediate between the HSE and Daughters of Charity to agree a service plan for the rest of the year that does not require such cuts to be made; (5) Deputy Dan Neville — the increase of 25% in suicide in 2009; (6) Deputy Seán Sherlock — the need to ensure the capacity to deliver acute services at Mallow General Hospital is not undermined under the reconfiguration process; (7) Deputy Martin Ferris — the HSE proposal to cut night cover at almost half of its 15 ambulance bases in counties Cork and Kerry; (8) Deputy Joe Costello — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain why so many applications for renewal of medical cards are being refused under the new system, particularly in the Dublin Central constituency; and (9) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to urgently provide an industrial strategy for the midlands, in the light of the closure of another key company in County Longford, with the associated loss of more than 100 jobs, to the detriment of the socioeconomic recovery of the region and the future industrial and commercial profile of Longford town and surrounding areas.The matters raised Deputies Dan Neville, Seán Sherlock, Joe Costello and Joan Burton have been selected for discussion.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	850	I appreciate the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the frightening increase in the rate of suicide.  The provisional suicide figures for 2009 show that the number of deaths by suicide has increased by 25%, from 424 in 2008 to 527 last year.  I suggest the real figure is much higher because there is a serious level of under-reporting of suicide.  Experts estimate that the true figure is as high as 650.  It is worth noting that 239 people died in road accidents last year.  In 2008, the level of HSE funding to the National Office for Suicide Prevention was €5.1 million and the State grant to the Road Safety Authority was an inadequate €40.4 million.  Figures will be published tomorrow to confirm that 11,966 people presented to hospital in 2009 having attempted suicide or engaged in self-harm.  For every person who presents at hospital, at least six more people are thought to engage in self-harm.  Therefore, the true figure for self-harm is approximately 70,000.  The Government must recognise and respond to the level of suicidal behaviour, which requires an emergency response.I wish to outline why I think this profound increase in suicide is taking place.  During recessionary times, there is a sudden gap between material needs and resources.  In economic downturns, frustration increases as an increasing proportion of people fail to meet their financial goals.  There is clear evidence that suicide is linked to financial difficulties.  The WHO has identified that the potential psychological impact of economic recession on public health is severe.  Job loss, job insecurity, job uncertainty, economic strain, loss of income, home repossession and restricted access to credit lead to a reduction in mental well-being, an increase in mental health problems and mental ill-health, increased substance misuse, especially alcohol and drugs, and intimate relationship breakdown and divorce.  There is a loss of perceived social worth, purpose and daily structure, a reduction in social contact, an increase in social isolation, and an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, non-fatal self-harm and completed suicides.  A protracted period of unemployment, especially at a young age, seems to have a particularly deleterious effect on the mental health of young men, regardless of their social background.  Rates of suicide are three to four times higher among those who are unemployed.The Minister for Health and Children and the HSE must respond to the changes in society that are leading to higher rates of suicide and problems associated with mental illness.  The failure of the Government to invest resources in mental health services, including suicide prevention, is one of the main contributory factors.  I will set out a hypothesis relating to why the Government may be choosing not to invest in this social health issue.  The stigma surrounding mental health issues and suicide is a barrier to the Government meeting the demands of society.  Each Government responds to the expressed demands of the electorate.  The demand for the Government to deal with suicide and mental health problems is not expressed due to the stigma associated with such matters.  We hear about many problems when we knock on doors, but hear little about mental health.  As we wish to protect ourselves and others from this stigma in some way, we do not demand the services that are badly needed for us or our family members.  True political leadership must respond to the politically unexpressed needs of society.  The Government is not doing this because there are no votes in it.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	851	I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I compliment and commend him on the work he is doing in this area.  The Government is aware that suicide continues to be a significant public health issue.  Its prevention is a major challenge for health and social services at all levels.  Suicide is one of the most tragic events a family can experience.  The heartache of a family's grief cannot be underestimated or ignored.  As a nation, we must continue to ensure we take all steps to prevent suicide.  I am conscious that a discussion on figures, rates of suicide and policy strategies can seem detached from the individual tragedies represented by such statistics.  The provisional figures presented for 2009 show a 24% increase over the 2008 figures.  Caution should be exercised when comparing the 2009 statistics with those for 2008, however, as both figures are provisional.  Nevertheless, the increase in the rate of suicide in 2009 is of great concern.  The Department of Health and Children is consulting the HSE to consider what measures can be taken to counteract this worrying trend.  The largest increase has occurred in the 25 to 44 age group.  We will need to target this group to stop the continuing rise in suicide.It may be too early to quantify the effect of the current economic climate on mental health, but there is no doubt the crisis is placing a greater strain on many people and their families.  As public representatives, we meet individuals and representatives of various groups every day.  In the course of such meetings, people express concerns and fears about the impact the recession is having on their lives and their work.  Mental health promotion is key to minimising the consequences of the recession.  In 2009, the National Office for Suicide Prevention launched two worthwhile initiatives which highlight the practical things we can do to protect our mental health — an information booklet, Suicide Prevention in the Workplace, as well as information leaflets and wallet cards on the theme of "looking after mental health during tough economic times".  Other initiatives developed by the office include the development and implementation of national training programmes; the development of a training strategy under the direction of a training and development officer; the progression of the availability of self-harm services through hospital emergency departments; the implementation of recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services; the appointment of dedicated suicide resource officers; the provision of funding to the National Suicide Research Foundation; the roll-out of support to voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention; and the development of mental health awareness campaigns.The elimination of the stigma associated with mental illness is key to good mental health.  Stigma can affect all aspects of life, limit access to employment and housing, harm social relationships and reduce self-esteem.   Fear of being labelled as having a mental health problem reduces the likelihood of individuals with mental health difficulties seeking treatment.As many Deputies will be aware, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health, Deputy John Moloney, recently launched See Change, the national stigma reduction campaign.  The aim of this campaign is to reduce the stigma people feel and to encourage them to seek help.  The campaign will inspire people to challenge their beliefs about mental illness and to be more open in their attitudes and behaviour.  It will also encourage people to support a friend or loved one who is experiencing a mental health problem.  Our vision is to achieve a change in Irish social attitudes and behaviour and to reduce the level of discrimination and prejudice.  In order to help make that vision a reality and to positively change attitudes, it is proposed to develop a range of national and local activities aimed at giving focused messages to the general public and target groups.  The campaign will include radio programmes, media interviews, a new website, newspaper articles and school presentations.The tragedy of suicide affects every community in the country.  The Government is firmly committed to reducing suicide, as part of a whole community effort to ensure that people in distress do not feel isolated and alone.  While a discussion on figures, rates of suicide and policy strategies can seem very detached from the individual tragedies represented by these figures, I assure Deputy Neville that the Government is firmly committed to tackling suicide in this country.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13721	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	852	I wish to raise an issue which I feel will have a deep impact on the ability of hospitals like Mallow General Hospital to deliver acute services.For the past five years we have been through a number of processes in relation to Mallow General Hospital, including the Horwath, Wrixon and Teamwork reviews.  Now, through a new national reconfiguration process, the HSE will seek, in an underhand and surreptitious way, to undermine the ability of the hospital to deliver acute services.I have before me a document in respect of this matter.  The people who represent the interests of the hospital and who live within its catchment area are undergoing a reconfiguration process, headed up by Professor John Higgins.  There is general agreement that change is needed within the hospital and that there will be implications for the delivery of acute services, but that the capacity of the hospital should not be undermined in any way.  In other words, if there is to be a loss or diminution of acute surgical services, they would be buttressed by acute medical services.We have bought into that process and have been given assurances in relation to it.  We now discover documentation emanating from the HSE showing that it seeks to assign to every hospital in the country a new modelling system ranging from 1 to 4, depending on the category of hospital, and which will put Mallow into the No. 2 category.  The document states that this hospital will not have an ICU so the patients and doctors need to be made aware that the resources are not in place to provide the full spectrum of an acute hospital resuscitation, that is, intubation, ventilation and resuscitation, IVR.  The patient must give informed consent and have knowledge of this prior to admission.  A ceiling of care discussion needs to take place and be documented with appropriate patients prior to admission to this facility.  The document goes on to say that standards of care should be measured and comparable to those delivered at a model 3 and model 4 hospital.  A model 3 or 4 hospital would be the equivalent of Cork University Hospital, which is a tertiary centre and the nearest geographically to Mallow.I demand a meeting with Mr. Pat Healy, regional director of operations for the HSE south region.  I demand respectfully, as is my right as an Oireachtas Member, a meeting with Ms Laverne McGuinness and Mr. Brian Gilroy, who are in charge of efficiencies, and I demand that the Joint Committee on Health and Children discuss this document because it will have serious implications for the delivery of acute care.  By a surreptitious and secretive method, the HSE will seek to diminish the ability of Mallow to deliver acute care.  If a ceiling of care discussion has to take place on every admission, most people will not be admitted to the hospital and will have to go to CUH, thereby reducing the ability of Mallow General Hospital to deliver services.There are many scenarios where resuscitation might be appropriate for an individual on whom a "do not resuscitate" order has been placed, for example, anaphylactic reaction to an infusion.  Such a notion has major consequences for the status and reputation of a hospital and for the esteem of those working there.  Discussion about ceilings of care as espoused in this process is, in most clinical situations, unnecessary and often inappropriate and counter-productive.  I wonder if dividing patients into categories of access with regard to resuscitation is unconstitutional, in that it would negate the rights of a patient.Numbers in the hospital would be so reduced that it would not be viable.  That is what is at play here.  This is an attempt by the HSE at national level to undermine the local reconfiguration process which all of the stakeholders have bought into.  We recognise that change is needed but it seems the HSE is trying push through a plan whereby hospitals like Mallow will no longer be able to provide acute care, whether medical or surgical, and the 4,500 people who are served in an acute setting in Mallow will have make their way through CUH, which does not have the capacity to deliver those services because the capital investment has not been made there.We need transparency.  I am asking, as is my right as an Oireachtas Member representing the people of Cork East, for a meeting with the HSE at national level so that I can learn what plans are afoot and what surreptitious methods are being employed in the downgrading of hospitals like Mallow.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	853	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  Patient safety is central to the delivery of health services.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so people can have confidence in the care they receive and have the best possible outcomes.  The overwhelming consensus among clinical experts is that demonstrably better outcomes, as seen in cancer care, are achieved for patients if delivery of complex care takes places where the necessary staff and equipment are available and where there are sufficient volumes of activity.  The evidence also emphasises the need to provide timely emergency care to patients in an appropriate setting.  To achieve better outcomes for patients, hospitals will need to fundamentally change the types of service they deliver to their communities and how those services are delivered.The reconfiguration of services in the HSE south area, when implemented, will result in an improved service. The clinical benefits for patients will be significant and the treatment offered will be of the highest standard.  Mallow General Hospital is one of six acute hospitals covered by the 2008 Horwath and Teamwork review of acute services in Cork and Kerry.  The task of reconfiguring acute services is informed by the principles stated in that review, as well as by the extensive consultation processes that have been carried out with stakeholders.The reconfiguration process is based on all hospitals delivering acute care within a national framework that is clear, safe and transparent.  The quality and clinical care directorate of the HSE has established a number of national programmes of care designed to lead to improvement and standardisation in health delivery outcomes.  Discussions are ongoing about developing a national framework for acute medical care in our hospital system that gives clarity to hospitals, ambulance staff and patients on how acute medical emergencies will be dealt with.  These discussions are clinician-led and include the active engagement of the management and staff of Mallow General Hospital.The overall reconfiguration plan for Cork and Kerry will consist of a comprehensive set of proposals, encompassing all acute services across the six Cork and Kerry hospitals.  The contribution that Mallow General Hospital makes to the people of north Cork and the importance of its capacity to the acute hospital system of Cork and Kerry is recognised in this context.  I understand that elements of the plan are still under discussion and, accordingly, they should not be taken out of context.  What can be said at this stage is that the plan will seek to use all hospitals in the region in an integrated manner, to provide better access to and improved capacity in all types of hospital care, both acute and less complex, and ultimately to provide a more equitable health service for all the people in Cork and Kerry.I hear what Deputy Sherlock is saying.     I will ask the Minister to organise the meeting he mentioned in his speech and I am sure that his office and the HSE will come back to Deputy Sherlock as quickly as possible.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	854	I presume I am not the only Deputy who thinks people in his constituency are experiencing considerable delays in the processing of medical card applications and renewal applications.  I have not seen anything like it in my life as a public representative.  The delays are horrendous.  Sick, old and disabled people are suffering because the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE decided to impose a system of processing medical card applications on top of a system designed to process the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  The Minister should have learned from what she did with the HSE, imposing that layer of bureaucracy onto the health board system which, in itself, has been a disaster.  She has now combined with the HSE to place this tier of centralisation of medical card applications and renewals on top of another system designed for an entirely different purpose.There have been long delays, files have gone missing and there is chaos in the system.  In the last analysis, the most vulnerable people suffer because they are the ones looking for medical cards and renewals; they are those left waiting and under stress, strain and anxiety because of the mismanagement and insensitivity in the way the HSE and the Minister for Health and Children have dealt with this matter.There is a great lack of information for applicants.  The actual service being provided in the PCRS is amazingly secretive.  It is almost like Fort Knox.  A person cannot simply turn up.  The place is guarded by dogs and security personnel and ordinary members of the public cannot go near it.  I understand the centre is in the Minister of State's constituency but people must deal with it as if it was a limbo situation.  It is non-personal and there is no opportunity for a person to speak with personnel to ask how his or her application is processing.  It has gone into the secretive centralised centre to which nobody has access — not a good approach in terms of transparency and dealing with the public.  I understand the PCRS was not consulted about this plan but that it was simply announced and then imposed on that body which did not have the services, personnel or resources to cater for this.  Belatedly, the Minister has begun to provide some resources.As early as 19 January, the Minister told the Oireachtas she fully supported the centralisation of the medical card application process and that centralisation would make the whole system more efficient.  She said at the time it would take only 15 working days to process an application.  That is cloud cuckoo land.  The situation has not improved.   I will be interested to hear whatever figures the Minister of State will trot out but six months later there is no sign of any improvements or improved efficiency in the system.  It still takes months to process applications and renewals and many of the files go missing in transit.I must agree with the statement of the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, who said the HSE is living in another world.  The Minister is also living in another world; it certainly is not one related to reality.   The Ombudsman was speaking about her own dealings with the HSE which she described as being from Alice in Wonderful.  We all experience this.I do not know whether the Minister of State has a hot line to deal with medical card applications for his constituents but the system is not working satisfactorily.   It may be that only my constituency is experiencing this dire service. However from comments I have heard from colleagues it seems this is a universal problem throughout the country.  I noted many cases that I have forwarded to the HSE and to the Minister.  The Minister acknowledges them and says she must send them to the HSE.  The HSE come back to me after a long time with replies.  It is very unsatisfactory and everything is in process.  It is in a state of chassis and it does not reach a conclusion.I would like to know whether there will be any improvements in the existing system and why there are so many people in my constituency who find this dire situation in regard to their applications for new medical cards or renewals.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	855	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  The determination of eligibility of applicants to medical cards is a matter for the Health Service Executive as provided for under the provisions of the Health Act, 1970.  Medical cards are provided to persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Prior to January 2009, local health offices provided the public with advice and assistance in regard to applying for medical cards and processed medical card applications in more than 100 offices around the country.As part of the HSE's ongoing programme to provide a more responsive and cost effective service, the HSE is centralising the processing aspect of medical card applications to its facility at the primary care reimbursement service in Dublin, as Deputy Costello noted.  Under the centralisation plan, the HSE's local offices will continue to provide the public with assistance and information locally in regard to medical card eligibility and making an application, and the current status of their application or review.From the customer's perspective, this means that at all times he or she will be able to seek advice from his or her local health office.  Local health offices have access to the national system to help clients with inquiries about their application or review and can also deal with queries of a general nature regarding the medical card scheme.On 11 June, the HSE launched a new website —www.medicalcard.ie - where individuals can make a medical card application online, track the status of their application or review and access a simple eligibility checker to check the current eligibility status of a medical card.  There is also a new on-line feedback and inquiry facility for the public to communicate directly with the PCRS.  Since the processing of medical cards for persons aged 70 and over was centralised in January 2009, the HSE has processed 2,801 renewal applications from clients aged 70 or over in Dublin North Central, the local health office area which covers the constituency area of Dublin Central, of which 2,673, or 95%, resulted in a new medical card being issued.  A total of 106 or 3.8% of applications were submitted without the necessary supporting documentation and the HSE is working with those applicants so that their applications may be completed.  A very small proportion — less than 0.32% — of applicants were unsuccessful following review.In regard to persons aged 70 years and over, the HSE recently introduced a new simplified declaration process for reviewing those cards so that the vast majority of persons aged 70 years and over do not have to undergo the more onerous review application form.  The new declaration comprises a single page form that can be completed with a single entry, signed and dated, in the event that the circumstances of the medical card holder and his or her dependants have not materially changed since their last review.  In respect of clients under 70 years of age in Dublin North Central, the HSE has processed 8,341 reviews, of which 6,946, or 83%, resulted in a new medical card being issued.  Some 1,125 or 13.5% of applicants are in communication with the HSE as their applications were submitted without all of the necessary documentation.   In this case, less than 2.5%, 205 applications, were unsuccessful following assessment in line with the national medical card-general practitioner visit card guidelines.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	856	I thank the Leas Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the very difficult issue of the senior primary school, Mary Mother of Hope national school, in Littlepace in Clonee, Dublin 15.  This is about the situation in Dublin West, where the vast bulk of primary and secondary schools have high numbers of international children.  A number of primary schools have over 70% of international children, and some schools have up to 40 different nationalities.The critical education support for education in this case has been English language teachers.  These are now under review, even though officials in the Department of Education and Skills know that the Dublin 15 area includes many children who do not have English as a mother language.  The decision by the Department and the Minister to cut further the teaching allocation to Mary Mother of Hope senior national school may result in very serious long-term consequences for the 107 international children who do not have English as their mother tongue and who desperately need English language classes to ensure that they can participate and prosper in the education system.Mary Mother of Hope senior national school will have only one English language support teacher for its 400 pupils from next September, compared to the three teachers it had for the 300 pupils it had only two years ago.  The school caters not just for the local Irish population, but for a very large population of international children.  It finds that because it is a senior cycle school, it is now suffering severe cuts because the Department officials argue that children only need two years of English language support.To date, schools, teachers, boards of management and patrons in Dublin West, and other areas with high numbers of international children, have done fantastic work in developing the children's language skills.  However, unless language skills are a specific focus over the entire course of a child's education, the child may well acquire speaking fluency without acquiring the academic fluency he or she needs to pursue further education.It is incredibly important that we do not create a situation where because newcomers lack English language skills, they begin to fall back on academic achievement in schools because they simply have not acquired academic fluency in English.  They become disaffected in secondary school and they drop out.  We are then in serious danger of repeating the pattern with which the Minister is all too familiar, where young boys drop out because they cannot connect with achievement in their schools.  If we do that, we are on the road to ghettoisation and to producing very large numbers of disaffected teenagers.  Some of that is already happening to some extent.There are two ways to approach this.  The Department needs to keep supplying English language teachers, or allow school principals more flexibility in using and distributing resources.  I go to places like Dublin 4 and Dublin South and the school children are all Irish and all white.  If people come out to my constituency, 25-30% of the children are international.  That has been very successful, but the key to the success is that children in school need a chance at success and they have to be able to integrate.  Language is the bedrock of integration.  It is extraordinarily short sighted for the Government to deprive children of English language education.  It will cost an incredible amount in social and economic integration in the long run.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	857	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to outline the position on language support teachers.  I want to provide an overall context on the language support provision and I will return to the issue of the aforementioned school.There has been a large influx of newcomers to Ireland in recent years and into schools and the Department recognised this through the provision of significant additional supports by way of English as an additional language, or EAL, support teachers.  The ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.In the 2009-10 school year, there were over 1,500 language support teachers in our schools, of which 1,185 were employed at primary level, providing support to approximately 30,000 eligible pupils.  I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources and that the quality of the supports the child receives and the inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing the quality of learning achieved by migrant children.  The Department of Education and Skills recognises that it must monitor and review the educational experiences provided to newcomer students so that it can improve the quality and effectiveness of its provision and, therefore, it is undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools.The inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills conducted an evaluation of the provision of English as an additional language in a number of schools in 2008-09.  This evaluated the quality of teaching and learning of English as an additional language that students experience in mainstream education and in support contexts in schools.  The findings of the research are currently being collated so that they can be analysed and a report prepared.  They will help to inform policy in the area of supports for students learning English as an additional language.  The inspectorate will draw up best practice guidelines and define what is needed with regard to teaching English as a second language.Since 2008, the Department has been providing specialist continuing professional development for EAL teachers, for school leaders and whole school teams, at both primary and post-primary level, through the primary professional development service and the second level support service.  There is a range of resource material available to schools which has been produced with the Department's support, including assessment toolkits for language proficiency and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's intercultural guidelines.The Department recognises that there are language and integration challenges for schools with significant numbers of students for whom English is not their first language.  The current pressures on the public finances mean that it is not possible to provide additional resources to schools over and above what has been agreed by the Government as necessary to cater for demographics and to deliver on the commitments in the renewed programme for Government.  Significant resources are already given to these schools and the challenge is to ensure that they are used to maximum effect.  The research projects being carried out will help to guide and develop Department policy into the future.The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled and the associated assessed levels of these pupils' language proficiency.  It is an annual allocation process that begins in the spring of each year when schools apply to the Department.  Language support posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed following clarification of actual enrolments on 30 September.Under current arrangements set out in Department Circular 0015/2009, a school would be allocated up to four language support teachers.  Additional support is also available for those schools which have at least 25% of their total enrolment made up of pupils who require language support.  Such applications for additional language support are dealt with through the staffing appeals process.The school to which the Deputy refers is entitled to a provisional allocation of one full-time temporary teaching post in respect of EAL support, based on its application to the Department.  This allocation is provisionally sanctioned until 31 August 2011 and is subject to the EAL pupils for whom support is sought remaining in attendance in the school on 30 September 2010.  The school submitted an appeal to the primary staffing appeal board which was considered by the board at its meeting on 21 June 2010.  The board decided that a departure from the staffing schedule was not warranted in this case and the school has been notified in this regard.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.I wish to thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	858	I take it that the Deputy is referring to the review of the design of the Community Development Programme (CDP) and Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP).Against the background of reforms underway by my Department, ongoing concerns to strengthen programme delivery and evaluation, and issues confirmed by a VFM Policy Review of the LDSIP, my Department was eager to access independent international expertise. It was in this context that, in consultation with the Office of the Minister of Children & Youth Affairs (OMCYA), my Department considered the Centre for Effective Service (CES) as offering a particular opportunity to support programme redesign, while overcoming the usual constraints of local interests and difficulty in accessing international expertise.The CES also offered capability to set out tangible, deliverable, qualitative outcomes for the LDSIP/CDP and wider programmes. In addition, my Department's view was that the CES would be in a position to provide ongoing mentoring on programme efficiency and evaluation over a number of years. The concept for the CES grew from an idea formulated initially by the Atlantic Philanthropies in the context of the provision of children's services — most notably the early childhood intervention project in Tallaght, Dublin. The CES was subsequently established as a joint venture between Government and the Atlantic Philanthropies.Consequently, in 2008 my Department engaged the CES to assist with the redesign of its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the LDSIP and CDP. Key outputs agreed with the CES were the review of the design of both programmes, which, informed by good international practice, would specify outcomes at the outset and provide effective evaluation mechanisms. It was also agreed that any proposals put forward should facilitate effective evaluation of the performance of local delivery structures and allow for either the re-alignment or merger of the two programmes.Under an agreement signed in October 2008 between my Department and the OMCYA with the CES, each will provide c€500,000 per annum to the Centre for 5 years. This amount will be matched by a contribution from the Atlantic Philanthropies of c€5m over the period. The agreement, which ends in 2012, sets out in detail deliverables to be provided over this period to each public body, as well as timelines for progress. Given—the unique nature of this project as a joint approach between Government and the Atlantic Philanthropies, particularly in the context of Government initiatives on children's services;the not-for-profit remit of the CES;the unparalleled access which CES has to international expertise on the design, delivery and evaluation of social programmes; and—the significant support available from the Atlantic Philanthropies; my Department did not consider that a competitive tendering arrangement was appropriate in this case.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	860	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17 and 19 together.As the Deputies will be aware, as part of the restructuring of Departments and agencies recently announced by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann to ensure greater coherence and produce more efficient delivery, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs   became the Department  of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, incorporating responsibility for social inclusion policy and family policy from the former Department of Social and Family Affairs and for equality, disability, integration and human rights from the former Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.I can confirm to the Deputies that the transfer of responsibility for each of these functions to the newly established Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, is now complete and Orders have been made by Government in this regard.As the transfer of functions process is concluded, it is now my intention to delegate the functions in respect of equality, human rights and integration to Minister of State White and to delegate functions transferred to my Department in relation to disability to Mr. John Moloney, TD, who will, of course, continue as Minister of State with special responsibility for Disability Issues and Mental Health at the Department of Health and Children, as well as the renamed Departments of Education and Skills, and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. My Department is currently liaising with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to progressing this matter.In relation to the number of staff who have been transferred to my Department in the context of the transfer of new functions and the location at which transferred staff are based, the following is the position:20 staff have transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Protection with social inclusion and family policy functions. These staff are in the process of being relocated to my Department's offices in Mespil Rd, Dublin 4.63 staff transferred to my Department from the Department of Justice and Law Reform with the equality, disability, integration and human rights functions. 33 of these staff are being accommodated in my Department's offices in Mespil Rd, Dublin 4, while the remaining 30 staff will remain in Bishop Square, Dublin 8 due to spatial constraints in the Mespil Road accommodationA further 69 staff also transferred to my Department from the Department of Justice and Law Reform, who are on secondment to the Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal.  Of these, 16 staff of the Equality Authority are located in Roscrea, Co. Tipperary while 10 Equality Tribunal staff are located in Portlaoise, Co. Laois.  The remaining 43 staff are located in accommodation in Clonmel Street, Dublin 2.For the sake of completeness, responsibility for the National Disability Authority, Irish Human Rights Commission and the Family Support Agency also transferred to my Department, with a total of 86 public servants working in these bodies.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	861	The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).  Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of May 2010, the transfers to the DAF have totalled some €587.5m, which includes interest earned of some €34.4m.  Funds reclaimed in that period total approx. €93.54m.The value of the DAF at the end of May 2010, net of liabilities, was some €67.9m.  This figure excludes €53.96m maintained in a Reserve Account to meet future reclaims by account holders and to cover expenses associated with the operation of the DAF.Allocations from the DAF — in accordance with Part 6 of the 2005 Act — are focussed on programmes or projects to assist:1. the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged;2. the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged or3. persons with a disability.The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the funding of projects in cross-border areas and the encouragement of peace building in the border areas is not explicitly provided for in the Dormant Account Acts.The Dormant Accounts Board recently prepared a revised Disbursement Plan, as required by legislation.  This plan provides the overall framework within which decisions on disbursements are made and funding allocated.  I anticipate that I will bring the Board's new Disbursement Plan to Government for approval in the coming weeks.Further details of projects to which funding has been allocated to date and a summary of the status of the DAF are available on my Department's website www.pobail.ie/en/ DormantAccounts.  For the Deputy's convenience, I am arranging to have a copy of the summary table forwarded directly to him.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I am aware of the 2010 World Drug Report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) which was published on 23rd June 2010.In compiling this report, the UNODC relies on Member States providing data primarily through the Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ).  In the case of Ireland, the Statistical Returns on Drug Control Progress, including the Annual Reports Questionnaire, are compiled by the Department of Health and Children.  Accordingly, the report of the UNODC does not contain any surprises in relation the figures for prevalence here.In relation to cocaine, the Report's findings reflect the outcome of the All-Island Drug Prevalence Survey 2006/07, which provides the best estimate of the drug prevalence in this country.  One of the findings of the 2006/07 survey was the emergence of cocaine as a threat, particularly among younger adults.The Report gives an overview of the changes in the world drug markets and indicates that:drug use worldwide is shifting towards new drugs and new markets;there are signs of an increase in drug use in developing countries;there are signs of a growing abuse of amphetamine-type stimulants and prescription drugs around the world;the world's supply of the two main problem drugs — opiates and cocaine — continues to decline;cocaine use in Western Europe appears to be concentrated in a few countries, notably in Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland and Denmark, where high cocaine prevalence rates are observed;in 2008, only around one fifth of problem drug users worldwide had received treatment in the previous year;cannabis use is declining in some of its highest value markets, namely North America and parts of Europe;the number of clandestine laboratories involved in the manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants is reported to have increased by 20 per cent in 2008, including in countries where such laboratories had never been detected before;manufacture of ecstasy has increased in North America (notably in Canada) and in several parts of Asia, and use seems to be increasing in Asia; andecstasy use in Europe has plummeted since 2006.Many of these points are broadly in line with our experiences in Ireland.  Accordingly, the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 has an appropriate balance between supply reduction and demand reduction measures. In the area of supply reduction, the focus is on reducing the volume of illicit drugs reaching Ireland and the disruption of the activities of organised criminal networks.  In regard to demand reduction, there will be a significant emphasis on prevention measures, with some such measures focusing on the broad population, while others will target specific groups that are deemed to be most at risk.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must endeavour to equip young people, in particular, with the skills and knowledge necessary to make informed choices about their health and future that will include a rejection of drug use.  There will also be a major focus on developing a national integrated treatment and rehabilitation service to aid those already involved with drugs.The difficulties facing our society as a consequence of problem drug use are significant, and addressing all the factors involved will not be easy.  However, I am determined that real progress will be made across the period of the Drugs Strategy, with all sectors working in a co-ordinated and targeted way, to achieve the implementation of the agreed actions.

In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the legislative and administrative actions required to enable the State to ratify the Convention. The Committee has developed a programme on which work is progressing, to address the matters that need to be aligned with the UNCRPD. One such requirement is to bring forward the Mental Capacity Bill, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Law Reform. As indicated in the Government Legislation Programme, it is intended that the Bill will be published in this parliamentary session.  The passage of the Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements under the Convention.The Inter-Departmental Committee, which is chaired by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs  since 1st June, has met on six occasions to date and its next meeting is scheduled for the Autumn.

My Department's involvement in discussions with those involved in this issue is to explore the scope for engagement by them, under the auspices of an agreed independent person, in relation to the matters involved, with a view to resolution of the dispute. These discussions continue but they remain at a sensitive stage.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	867	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 40 and 196 together.As the Deputies are aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes. These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).All community development projects (CDPs) and local development companies (LDCs) that are currently in receipt of funding through the LCDP have signed upto implement the new programme in the context of my Department's integration strategy; andto meet specified deadline dates (submission of workplan by 26 March 2010 and of integration plan by 30 June 2010).The position is that, unless a project has received provisional approval from my Department for an alternative LCDP integration model, groups were still required to submit their plans for full integration by 30 June. There are no plans to effect any general extension to that deadline.My Department has set out a national model involving full integration of CDPs with LDCs, but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'. Alternative models will, however, be required to meet a range of criteria, including a reduction in the number of structures, promoting the potential for integrated delivery of services to the public, supporting efficiencies and reducing the burden of company law compliance for CDPs. The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis.In recent weeks, I have been able to respond positively to possible alternative models put forward by the Paul Partnership and Limerick City CDPs, and by HSE South and a number of CDPs in the Cork/Kerry area. While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am confident that the real possibility for agreement exists.Additional proposals from other CDPs and LDCs, including Northside Partnership, the National Community Development Forum and others, have also been under consideration. However, a model that does not entail significant change is unlikely to meet the specified criteria.  It is anticipated that any alternative models of the nature proposed, if agreed, could be for use in a small number of specific areas only. However, I can assure the Deputies that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives, based on the specified criteria, and that my officials will continue to be available to meet with the boards of projects.It is important to note that, despite what is stated by some commentators, full integration does not mean closure of a CDP or the cessation of CDP activities in any given area. As has been stated previously, any worthwhile community development activity or service delivered under a CDP can continue to be delivered under the proposed new LCDP structure and by the same staff who currently do this work.  Of course, CDPs may opt out of the LCDP integration process and decide to go it alone. In such cases, my Department will be supportive in relation to the retention of any assets acquired with programme funding and may also be in a position to provide for some limited funding for a transition period, subject to certain conditions.A number of CDPs have raised concerns about the treatment of assets (particularly buildings) in a full integration situation, where all assets and net liabilities would usually transfer by agreement. However, I want to emphasise that other arrangements are possible — for example, the ownership of buildings need not transfer to an LDC.  This was also made clear in the context of the information event for CDPs and LDCs, held by Pobal on my Department's behalf, on 10 June last.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	868	The Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 has funding of €425m available to be allocated to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.  One of the objectives of the RDP is to identify and provide appropriate cultural and leisure facilities to local communities not otherwise available to them and, in principle, it is possible that playgrounds could be eligible under the RDP. There are 36 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these Groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the individual Group's local development strategy and in line with my Department's operating rules and EU regulations.Under the Primary School Outdoor Play Facilities Enhancement Scheme, which operates under the CLÁR Programme, assistance may be available, subject to resources, towards improving outdoor play facilities in small rural primary schools in CLÁR areas. The type of projects funded include the grassing/tarmacadam of play areas, the supply of goal posts, nets, basketball hoops, etc. and other recreational facilities for these outdoor play areas.  CLÁR may fund 75% of the cost, up to a maximum of €7,500, with the balance provided from local sources. The total funding approved under this Scheme since 2002 is over €5.7m, with 867 schools benefiting.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I propose to take Questions 28, 200 and 201 together.Through its focus on deprivation and social exclusion, the RAPID Programme will continue to address the impact of the economic downturn on vulnerable communities and to provide opportunities for social and economic recovery.In order to ensure the continued relevance of the Programme, a review of RAPID area boundaries has been undertaken, based on an analysis of data from the most recent Census across a range of socio-economic and deprivation indicators.  This was done to ensure that areas are appropriately targeting the most disadvantaged communities.Following the review, the Government approved the inclusion of five new towns in the RAPID Programme in 2009 — Ballina, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Mullingar and Rathkeale.  The review also proposed changes to the boundaries of some of the other 46 RAPID areas and I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard shortly.In 2010, funding of €5m has been allocated for the RAPID leverage schemes, whereby my Department co-funds with other Departments and agencies a range of small-scale local projects, such as playgrounds, traffic measures, health facilities, CCTV and sports facilities. In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that my primary focus will continue to be to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department, and especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities, are protected.Finally, the Deputy will be aware that it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and the progress on delivery with respect to projects under their areas of responsibility in the RAPID areas.

To date, some 150 groups have applied to register with my Department and operate the new Scheme.The Seniors Alert Scheme does not differ substantially from the CSOP and will continue to operate by means of community-based grants to local community and voluntary groups.  While the eligibility criteria remain broadly the same, new application and assessment procedures have been introduced to improve the management and administration of the Scheme and to reduce the administrative burden on groups.The range of equipment eligible for support has also been modified.  Equipment grant-aided under the Scheme now includes interior emergency lighting, which was previously only available to older people living on offshore islands.  The range of equipment eligible for grant support is subject to ongoing review by my Department and may be extended, as appropriate, to meet the objectives of the Scheme, subject to resources.My Department will continue to process applications received under the CSOP prior to its closure in May.  To date in 2010, some €1.2m in grant support has been provided to 298 community groups for the provision of items of safety and security equipment to almost 3,700 older people.  Details of grant support paid to community groups are published monthly on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	875	I have seen a copy of the report in question and am aware of its findings. As the report, by its own admission, deals with the "likely consequences" of the 2010 Budget, it is by its nature speculative, as is its projection of 5,000 job losses in the community and voluntary sector.In relation to the provision of supports to the community and voluntary sector by my Department, I can assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the development of our communities and our belief that the area of community development is central to the social and economic well-being of the country. Unfortunately, however, in the current economic climate, this sector, like all sectors of the Irish economy, has to operate within reduced budgets, and to rationalise and provide more effective services to the public, wherever possible.As the Deputy will be aware, the future funding of the community and voluntary sector will be a matter for consideration by Government in the context of the 2011 Estimates process and funding allocations will not be confirmed until the 2011 Budget is announced.I should add that the report in question refers to matters relating to a number of other Departments and agencies and it is, of course, for those bodies to respond, as appropriate, on areas relevant to them.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	877	The Deputy will be aware that as part of the restructuring of Departments and agencies recently announced by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established, incorporating responsibility for social inclusion policy and family policy from the former Department of Social and Family Affairs and for equality, disability, integration and human rights from the former Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The transfer of these functions has indeed resulted in more personnel, expertise and enhanced capacity in my Department in terms of analytical strategy development, with particular analytical expertise transferring into my Department with the social inclusion and family policy functions. My Department's responsibilities now include the analysis of the impact and effectiveness of public policy on poverty and social inclusion, and responsibility for promoting the development of data strategies and research to inform anti-poverty and social inclusion policies and practice and facilitating improved monitoring of outcomes.In relation to the issue of programme design, programme development and the role of the community sector in this process, the Deputy will be aware that, against a background of reforms underway by my Department, ongoing concerns to strengthen programme delivery and evaluation, and issues confirmed by a VFM Policy Review of the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP),  my Department engaged the Centre for Effective Services (CES) in 2008 to provide objective and independent advice and assistance with the redesign of community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the LDSIP and the Community Development Programme.I am advised that, during this redesign process, the CES consulted with all relevant stakeholders, including the community sector, on matters relating to the programmes and their redesign. The independent role of the CES provided for objective and critical debate on the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the programmes, as opposed to their delivery.On 1 January 2010, the redesigned Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) was rolled out across communities and the CES continues to work with my Department in relation to the LCDP and the programme design agenda across my Department's range of functions.Consultation with the key social inclusion stakeholders has always been an integral part of my Department's operational agenda and will continue to be so through our ongoing work on policy development and programme delivery.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	878	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 50 together.Responsibility for progressing the active citizenship agenda was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to my Department in May 2010. My Department will be supported in its role by the Steering Group on Active Citizenship, chaired by Ms Mary Davis, which is working to develop community engagement and encourage greater levels of civic-minded activities by citizens who are committed to making a positive difference within their communities.Overall, I welcome the integration of this work into my Department, which will complement our ongoing efforts to encourage voluntary activity and community development.  I met with Ms Davis last week to discuss how we can quickly progress the agenda, and I am looking forward to a productive engagement with the Steering Group into the future.I understand that the Steering Group — in consultation with a range of Government Departments — has progressed a number of public policy recommendations of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship.  These include the following:An audit of community, sports and arts facilities, which was initiated through the local authorities in 2008.   Thirty-two of the thirty-four local authorities have completed their audits, with the remaining two in progress.  This work will help to inform Government on the provision of facilities and identify opportunities for getting the best use of recreational facilities around the country.In relation to the Taskforce's recommendations for strengthening local civic participation, the views of the Taskforce were taken into account in drafting the Green Paper on Local Government, Stronger Local Democracy:  Options for Change.  Work on the White Paper on Local Government Reform is at an advanced stage, with publication by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government expected following consideration of local government financing in light of the Report of the Commission on Taxation.The Department of Education and Skills has encouraged schools to make their premises available for the use of community and other groups.  The pilot programme to expand the use of school facilities is operated from a fund administered by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  In addition, in May 2008, the then Minister for Education announced details of a scheme under the Dormant Accounts Fund to enable DEIS schools in Limerick city to open after school hours, including weekends and holiday periods, provide after school programmes and to maximise community use of school premises and facilities.At second level senior cycle, the National Council for Curriculum Assessment has developed a syllabus for a full optional exam subject called ‘Politics and Society' as an extension of the current Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) subject in Junior Cycle, which currently gives students practical experience of active citizenship.  In relation to the adult education sector, the range of Further and Adult Education Programmes are geared towards enabling participants to contribute more fully to the social, cultural and economic life of this country, through education and information courses.Active Citizenship will be the main theme of the planned Social Inclusion Week to be held in October next as part of the Irish National Programme of activities supporting the EU Year for Combatting Poverty and Social Exclusion 2010. The Steering Group has been liaising with my Department to advise on active citizenship awareness and practical activities which could be undertaken by communities, working with the local authorities around the country during that week.An Independent Electoral Commission is to be established and, in line with the revised Programme for Government 2009, is to be mandated with a number of responsibilities including administering the voter registration process, running voter education programmes and advising on mechanisms to increase the participation of women in political life. It is intended that the new Commission will also take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending, and examine the issue of financing the political system.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The Centre for Effective Services (CES) was developed in recognition of the fact that:high quality research and data informs good social policy; andthe application of evidence-based policy making can make a real difference in the quality of services delivered, and, ultimately, in the quality of beneficiaries' lives.At its most basic, the approach is to seek to provide a means to enable projects to access the expertise that they need in a timely and supportive basis, to be focussed on tangible outcomes, and to lend themselves to robust objective evaluation. The underlying aim is to develop a process whereby programmes and projects can be designed, developed and evaluated on the basis of a ‘what works' pragmatic approach.Against a background of reforms underway by my Department, ongoing concerns to strengthen programme delivery and evaluation, and issues confirmed by a VFM Policy Review of the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP), my Department was eager to access independent international expertise. Separately, one of the issues with the local/community development programmes operated by my Department had been the difficulty in objectively demonstrating whether our programmes are actually working or not.It was in this context that my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Minister of Children & Youth Affairs (OMCYA), considered the CES as offering a particular opportunity to support programme redesign, while overcoming the usual constraints of local interests and difficulty in accessing international expertise.The CES also offered capability to set out tangible, deliverable, qualitative outcomes for the LDSIP/Community Development Programme (CDP) and wider programmes. In addition, my Department's view was that the CES would be in a position to provide ongoing mentoring on programme efficiency and evaluation over a number of years. The concept for the CES grew from an idea formulated initially by the Atlantic Philanthropies in the context of the provision of children's services — most notably the early childhood intervention project in Tallaght, Dublin. The CES was subsequently established as a joint venture between Government and the Atlantic Philanthropies.Consequently, in 2008, my Department engaged the CES to assist with the re-design of its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the LDSIP and CDP. Key outputs agreed with the CES were the review of the design of both programmes, which, informed by good international practice, would specify outcomes at the outset and provide effective evaluation mechanisms. It was also agreed that any proposals put forward should facilitate effective evaluation of the performance of individual local delivery structures and allow for either the re-alignment or merger of the two programmes.Under the agreement signed in October 2008 between my Department and the OMCYA with the CES, each will provide c€500,000 per annum to the Centre for 5 years. This amount will be matched by a contribution from the Atlantic Philanthropies of c€5m over the period. The agreement, which ends in 2012, sets out detailed deliverables to be provided over this period to each public body, as well as timelines for progress.Giventhe unique nature of this project as a joint approach between Government and the Atlantic Philanthropies, particularly in the context of Government initiatives on children's services;the not-for-profit remit of the CES;the unparalleled access which CES has to international expertise on the design, delivery and evaluation of social programmes; andthe significant support available from the Atlantic Philanthropies; my Department did not consider that a competitive tendering arrangement was appropriate in this case.I am advised that ten staff are currently employed by the CES.  In addition, three persons are engaged on a temporary/freelance basis for specific duties and there is one person on secondment to the Centre from the OMCYA.  A staff member from the HSE is also expected to join the CES later in the year and my Department will also be releasing a member of staff to the Centre on a part-time basis.Finally, I understand that since the establishment of CES in late 2008, there have been numerous meetings and contacts with the voluntary and community sector.  This would include several hundred contacts and meetings, ranging in nature from telephone conversations and face-to-face meetings to intensive consultations and collaborations. I am advised that the profile of organisations, projects, initiatives and persons in the sector who have been contacted and who have met with CES staff has been very diverse.  They would include very large organisations, as well as small local projects within the child, family and community fields.

However, as CLÁR leverages funding through other Departments and agencies, the value of the investment in rural areas that is being supported through the Programme will be considerably higher.I have no immediate plans to further expand the Programme.  However, in the context of the current economic climate, a particular focus of my Department has been on ensuring that projects are completed in a timely manner. To this end, my officials have been working closely with the other Government Departments and agencies with which a number of measures under the Programme are co-funded.  Arising from this work, I am pleased to say that a significant number of projects have been completed over the last year, while the completion of others is being continuously monitored with my Department's co-funding partners.

Prior to the establishment of this fund, my Department had provided funding to a number of individual universities for this purpose.This funding initiative has proved extremely successful in raising the profile and perceived status of the Irish language at home and abroad, and in opening up opportunities for personal and career development for young Irish language teachers and other professionals.  It also develops positive links at Governmental and university level between Ireland and other participating countries, as well as the interpersonal contacts that are so important in the long-term in ensuring a positive awareness of Ireland among our EU partners and further afield.At present around thirty third-level colleges and universities in the USA, in European countries and further afield, are providing Irish language and Celtic Studies programmes within their own institutions with the assistance of funding from my Department.  I believe that the demand for funding from this scheme from universities worldwide is a clear indicator, not only of the interest within the academic community in Irish as one of the world's oldest vernacular languages, but also as proof of the opportunities available to Irish speakers globally.I would mention in particular the two-way exchanges promoted via our participation in the Fulbright Commission's programme and in partnership with the Ireland-Canada University Foundation.  Aside from the value in terms of promotion of the language, there is a direct economic return in cultural tourism terms, as many of the international students who study Irish in their home institutions will continue their studies in Ireland.The funding provided under this heading to universities and organisations in 2009 and to date in 2010 is set out in tabular form.University/OrganisationGrants Paid 2009Grants Authorised 2010€€Fulbright Commission231,000231,000Ireland Canada University Foundation200,000200,000Coláiste na nGael, Paris, France16,74816,748Daltaí na Gaeilge, New Jersey, USA19,000—Glucksman College, New York17,00017,000Institiúd na hÉireann, Pittsburgh, USA25,000—Lehman College, NYU, New York, USA10,00010,000University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Wales30,00030,000Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland18,46816,500University of Brest, France24,08424,084Cambridge University, England23,39225,198Cardiff University, Wales24,56919,753Edinburgh University, Scotland18,25018,800Freiburg University, Frieburg, Germany18,10018,100Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany3,000—Karlova University, Prague, Czech Republic10,96411,000Martin Luther University, Halle, Germany—4,200Mannheim University, Germany61,00061,000Marburg University, Germany2,8005,400University of Montana, USA60,00030,000Oslo University, Norway7,639—Uppsala University, Sweden13,37713,778University of the Ruhr, Germany15,47215,472Sheffield University, England28,18329,963Sydney University, Sydney, Australia—8,530SKSK University, Germany6,0006,000St. Mary’s University, Twickenham, England—3,746University of St. Thomas, Minnesota14,7789,332University of St. Thomas, Texas, USA35,57457,993University of St. Thomas, Texas, Gaeltacht course7,500—Vienna University, Austria20,00020,000Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands30,00030,000Volkshochshule Buxtehude, Germany760760University of Beijing, China—8,300Totals992,658942,657

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	886	At the outset, I wish to inform the Deputy that in 2006 and 2007 funding was provided by my Department under the Fo-Chiste Gnó of its Scéimeanna Tacaíochta Gaeilge (formerly Ciste na Gaeilge) to a number of voluntary and business groups for the provision of Christmas lights in the Irish language. The purpose of the funding was to assist in promoting the Irish language among the local business community.  In order to qualify for funding, a group was required to provide a business plan to include specific targets relating to the promotion of Irish and a clear exposition as to how these targets would be met.  Funding from my Department was provided on the basis that matching funding (a minimum of 25%) was secured by the applicant from the local authority or from the local business community.No funding was approved under this fund in 2008 or 2009 for the provision of Christmas lights in the Irish language and it is not proposed to make funding available this year, having regard to the current economic climate.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	889	As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for equality, human rights, integration and disability matters formally transferred from the Department of Justice and Law Reform to my Department on 1 June 2010.  As the equality function was a matter for the Department of Justice and Law Reform up to that date, material and information in that regard could be accessed on that Department's site.Following on from the formal transfer of the equality functions to my Department on 1 June, officers at my Department have been reviewing and updating the content of my Department's website and I can confirm that material in relation to equality matters is now accessible on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie. I anticipate that further expansion and consolidation work will be carried out on the website over the coming period.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	890	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been, and will continue to be, a key element in the export led recovery of this economy.In March 2010, IDA Ireland published ‘Horizon 2020’, a document which sets out the Agency’s strategy for attracting FDI into Ireland in the coming decade.  The targets for this strategy include the creation of 105,000 new jobs in Ireland in the period 2010-2014.  Fifty per cent of these investments are to be based in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  The Strategy is being implemented over the five year period 2010-2014.  I am glad to report that IDA has made good progress since the strategy was launched.There have been 48 IDA investment announcements to date in 2010, an average of  2 per week.  The new strategy also places a strong emphasis on transformation of existing industrial operations and  IDA has developed a suite of support mechanisms to assist its client companies along this transformation agenda.  Within the organisation, IDA has established a new High Growth Markets Team to achieve 20% of Greenfield investments into Ireland by 2014 originating from these markets. In addition, a second specialised team has also been established to target new High Growth FDI companies, which are the seeds of tomorrow's multinationals.Progress is also being made on delivering the regional target element of the strategy with some significant project announcements including EA Games in Galway (200 jobs), Warner Chilcott in Dundalk a life sciences company (200 jobs), Mirror Controls International in Leitrim (50 jobs), Enercon in Tralee (30 jobs), and Mfg.com in Drogheda (50 jobs).   IDA is continuing its efforts to win investments for Ireland and then to encourage, where appropriate, investments to locate in regional locations in line with the National Spatial Strategy (NSS).  There have also been job investments in the Dublin and Cork regions including Dun and Bradstreet (100 jobs), IBM Smarter Cities Technology Centre (200 jobs), Telefonica (100 jobs) and United Technologies Corporation (37 jobs).IDA has also developed a new marketing campaign, which was launched in North America, our biggest market for FDI.  The PR campaign is aimed at highlighting the many positive characteristics of Ireland and is resulting in some recent positive media coverage of Ireland's attractiveness as an industrial development location.While recognising that we are still in the early stages of a 5 year plan, I consider that IDA has made a good start on achieving the targets which it has set for itself and I am confident of continued success.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	891	An indication of IDA's commitment to balanced regional development is that one of the high levels goals in the Agency's new strategy, "Horizon 2020” is a commitment, that by 2014, 50% of all FDI investments will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.   The challenge in achieving an even spread of investment is intensified as the sophistication of investments increase.  Competition for Foreign Direct Investment comes not just from other countries, but from city regions with populations in excess of one million people.  Dublin is the only recognised city region in Ireland that meets this criterion.In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA's new strategy places renewed emphasis on the "Gateway" regions.  The "gateways" in Ireland are going to be critical growth areas in the future. Successful enterprise development and the creation of an attractive location is interdependent.  Regions/Gateways that support strong and dynamic enterprise are crucial to Ireland's return to balanced economic growth and IDA will continue to focus on balanced development through these regional gateways.In the case of Waterford, IDA is concentrating on the gateway City of Waterford and on the town of Dungarvan.  In addition to marketing the area for new inward investment, IDA Ireland is also actively engaged with the existing IDA client base in Waterford City and County, to encourage their transition to higher value activities and to promote further investment in Ireland.  Clear evidence of a transition to more knowledge based and higher value activity is seen in the resilience of companies such as Bausch & Lomb, Honeywell and GlaxoSmithKline, as well as newer additions to the county's portfolio, such as Citi Hedge Funds, Genzyme and Sun Life Financial.  In marketing County Waterford for new foreign direct investment (FDI), IDA Ireland is focused on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge-based industries (including advanced manufacturing).  Sectors of focus in the medium term will be Life Sciences, ICT, International Services and High Technology Engineering.To date in 2010, there have been 4 site visits by potential investors to Waterford City and County.  While IDA seeks to influence the selection of locations for new investment, the final decision on where to visit and where to invest lies with the investor.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	892	Employment data in respect of companies supported by Enterprise Ireland is collated by Forfás on an annual basis and accordingly data is not yet available for 2010.  To date in 2010 total funding of €2.78m has been provided by Enterprise Ireland to companies in County Waterford, to support enterprise, thus enabling job creation.  This figure includes payments under the employment subsidy scheme, which is supporting the maintenance of vulnerable jobs.  At a micro enterprise level €594,374 has been allocated for the provision of direct financial and other soft supports to companies through the Waterford County and City Enterprise Boards.  Grants paid to IDA Ireland supported companies in County Waterford total almost €1 million to date in 2010.The wider supports targeted at County Waterford include the South-East Enterprise Platform Programme which is underway at the Waterford Institute of Technology as part of Enterprise Ireland's South East Regional Strategy.  The 2009/2010 programme has had 20 participants to date in the County. As part of the ongoing drive to promote entrepreneurship in the region, Enterprise Ireland has also rolled out a series of Enterprise START workshops to encourage potential entrepreneurs to explore their business ideas. During 2009, 49 participants took part in this initiative in Waterford and the most recent workshop held in March 2010, had 18 participants.Furthermore, the South East Enterprise Week, which takes place annually, showcases successful entrepreneurs and encourages and assists current and potential entrepreneurs. Throughout the South East, events take place to promote and encourage entrepreneurship. Local Enterprise Ireland staff are closely involved in the initiative through the Spirit of Enterprise Regional Forum.On a national basis, Enterprise Ireland continues to support the growth of new and existing internationally trading Irish enterprises. A Fund for Job Expansion has been launched by Enterprise Ireland, which will provide support of up to €150,000 to eligible clients taking on a development plan which will increase employment. The first call for this competitive Fund closed in May with a further two calls scheduled for later this year. The Fund will assist companies in areas such as capital, technology acquisition, training, the recruitment of key managers and consultancy.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 10 May, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from November 2009.In relation to Redundancy claims, the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include: almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents; prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments; better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website; engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  In the period 1 January 2010 to 31 May 2010 new claims amounted to 28,587 — a fall off of almost 20% on the corresponding 5 month period in 2009 when 35,559 new claims were lodged.  The reduction in incoming claims is most welcome.  Inroads are being made in the backlog of claims reducing from 42,591 in December 2009 to a level of 34,881 at end May 2010.  In the first five months of 2010, 34,036 claims were processed, up 130% on the same period last year.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

Details of the number of new jobs created in each of those years is set out in the statement.IDA Ireland recognises the need to provide high value employment opportunities in county Mayo, which provide sustainable long-term jobs.  IDA Ireland's strategies have proved successful, despite the difficult and ever changing global economy and at present there are 19 IDA supported companies in Mayo employing 2,992 people in permanent employment and a further 498 in temporary and contract employment, across a range of sectors.In addition to marketing the county for new inward investment through its network of overseas offices, IDA also works with the existing client base in the county, encouraging them to grow and expand their operations there.  As part of its strategy to attract inward investment, IDA Ireland introduces a prospective client company to 3 or 4 selected locations, which can meet the company's requirements for skills, labour, site and/or buildings, and infrastructure.  In selecting locations to show companies, IDA Ireland seeks to include locations which have been affected by closures and job losses and also gives priority to the Border, Midlands and West regions.In the three-year period 2007 to 2009, there have been a total of 8 such site visits, by potential investors, to County Mayo.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 11 September, 2009.  In the course of processing the claim, queries were raised with the employer and I understand that a response on one outstanding aspect is awaited.  As soon as this issue is resolved the claim can be processed for payment without further delay.In general, the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor confirming the inability of the company to pay the redundancy entitlements as well as requesting the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If the required information is provided to the Department, the employees will be paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.

My Department has however received a number of claims for the company for which the individual previously worked which are currently being processed.  In these circumstances, and on the basis that the individual believes he is eligible for redundancy, it would be advisable for the individual to contact his former employer who could, in turn, submit (or resubmit if that is the case) a claim to my Department.

A borrower whose loan is transferred to NAMA will continue to owe the full amount borrowed and the conditions of the loan will generally remain the same. NAMA will manage these loans in the best interest of taxpayers and where necessary will seize property or other assets which are the security to a loan which is not being repaid.  A NAMA type scheme for mortgage holders would operate on the same basis and would not be in the best interest of mortgage holders.  I have not costed such an option.The Government is aware of the difficulties being experienced by mortgage holders.  As the Deputy is aware, last February I announced the establishment of an Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney.  The Group, which has initially explored the feasibility of a range of possible options for improving the level of mortgage support to homeowners in difficulty, will report to me with its initial recommendations very shortly.I understand that the Group will then examine further options, including the costing of such options and report to me with its final report on mortgage issues in early autumn.

However, the Central Bank Act 1942 requires my approval for an annual statement by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) of proposed income and expenditure specifying the amounts to be raised by levies in respect of financial regulation. Once I have approved it, the statement is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the annual report of the IFSRA which shows the outcome of income and expenditure in the previous year is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.The CBFSAI has advised me that over the last five years some 50 per cent of the total costs of the Financial Regulator have been met by the imposition of levies on the industry. The balance of the total annual costs is provided by the CBFSAI in accordance with Section 33(L) of the Central Bank Act 1942. In 2009, the CBFSAI bore the full cost of certain securities market supervision activities carried out within the Financial Regulator.The tables set out the total cost of regulation, the total contribution from industry and the contribution from each industry category for each of the last five years.YearFinancial Regulator Total ExpensesSubvention from CBFSAIActual Funding Requirements from Industry*€m€m€m200541.320.420.4200648.724.421.2200752.625.423.4200859.929.125.0200961.127.334.9***This figure takes account of a surplus or deficit in the previous years funding requirement.

Consequently, matters which relate to the normal commercial business of the bank, including the processing of loan applications and other business services by the bank, are a matter for the Board of Anglo.As the Deputy will be aware the bank is restricted under the terms of the Subscription Agreement from issuing new loans to new or existing clients save where the lending is necessary to protect the bank's asset quality, to ensure losses are kept to a minimum in its Loan Book or pursuant to legally binding commitments.I am informed by the bank that for existing committed facilities where the loan/legal documentation is confirmed to be in place, payments are typically made within a minimum of 2 working days. Delays to payments being released may arise for a number of reasons e.g. incomplete loan/legal documentation or facility balance being in excess of limit and in such cases it is necessary to refer the case to Credit Committee for approval.With regard to customers who require release of security resulting from the sale of an asset it is important that the bank ensures a true market value is being realised for the asset. Once this requirement has been satisfied and the arrangements are within the terms of the Credit Committee approval, the request will typically be approved in a timely manner.My Department has no role or involvement in processing loan applications.

Each year, the amount transferred to the Exchequer from the National Lottery surplus, together with details of the total Exchequer allocations to the relevant subheads are set out in Appendix 1 of the annual "Revised Estimates for Public Services".Since 2005, the expenditure allocations for the relevant subheads exceed the amount available from the National Lottery surplus. Therefore, these subheads are now described as being "part-funded by the National Lottery", and the balance of the expenditure allocation for the subheads comes from normal Exchequer sources.The following is a summary of the information contained at Appendix 1 of the "Revised Estimates for Public Services" for the last few years:200720082009Total Exchequer allocation to the Subheads part-funded by the National Lottery€444m€472m€435m

Consequently, matters which relate to the normal commercial business of the bank, including the detailed arrangements with individual customers and other business services are a matter for the Board of the bank.Information on the bank's contracts and loan conditions are commercially sensitive and it would therefore not be appropriate to release such information. In order to provide insight into how such matters are managed the bank has informed me that where payments are being made to cover salary obligations of borrowers they are typically approved as part of a working capital/cash facility. It is important to note that the bank does not, in the normal course of business, employ or pay developers. However, approved working capital/cash facilities provided under specific loan arrangements will typically comprise a number of payment requests such as individual creditor payments and salaries.

Under that provision, an tArd Chlaraitheoir (Registrar General) is required to maintain a register of domestic adoptions (i.e. adoptions effected in Ireland, regardless of where the adopted person was born).  The register is called the Adopted Children Register.  An index to the register is maintained and can be searched by any person.  Any person may obtain a copy of any entry in the register.  The legislation also provides for an index linking the birth entry in the register of births (in the case of an Irish-born adopted person) with the entry in the Adopted Children Register.  Information from this index may not be given to any person except by order of a court or the Adoption Board. It is a matter for the Adoption Board, which is an independent quasi judicial body, to treat each application it receives in this regard on its individual merits. I am aware that the treatment of adopted persons in this regard differs from the rest of the population but consideration of this issue must take place in the context of the complex legal, ethical and constitutional issues arising from the need to fairly balance the rights of all parties to the adoption process.Since 2003, when an adoption legislation consultation paper was published by the then Minister for Children, two pieces of legislation were envisaged. The first to provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption and to make changes to the role and structure of the Adoption Board and the second to provide for a structured and regulated way of providing access to information and contact for those affected by adoption. I indicated during the Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill, 2009, at the Select Committee on Health and Children my intention to bring forward legislation specifically on the issue of information and tracing. In this regard, the policy position is currently being assessed by my Office. Once this process is complete Government approval will be sought to commence the process of preparing legislation.

The Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) of the HIQA inspects HSE residential services, including special care units and foster care services. They also inspect children detention schools.In total there are 164 children's residential centres, including hostels and high support units. 75 of these are run by the HSE and inspected by the SSI/HIQA. These inspection reports are available to view online. In addition, there are 89 non-statutory, or private and voluntary facilities, registered and inspected by the HSE.The accommodation for separated children seeking asylum is under the remit of HSE inspectors. Four children's residential centres for separated children seeking asylum have been inspected and registered by the HSE.

Applications for the scheme are now closed and a short-list of applicants has been prepared for further detailed consideration by POBAL. The short-listing of applications was carried out by local city and county development boards, in accordance with the terms of the scheme. The boards made their decisions based on the official criteria and appraisal of application guidelines. A copy of these guidelines was supplied to all applicants. In arriving at their final decisions in relation to the short-listing of applications, the boards also based their decisions on local knowledge and expertise.At the preselection stage, applicants can approach their local city or county development board to find out whether they have been short listed for the next stage of the scheme.Announcements in relation to the next stage of the scheme will be made later in the year once the short-listed applications have been examined.

The table details the amount of funding by programme, the organisation to whom the grant was paid, the amount of the grant and the project for which the grant was provided, both revenue and capital. The 2008 and 2009 tables also outline the amount sought by each organisation and the amount subsequently approved by me. In general lottery funding is used as a contribution towards the cost of a project although in some instances, for example the purchase of a mini bus for an organisation, the lottery grant would comprise the full cost of the purchase.In addition, the Health Service Executive funds a wide range of voluntary bodies to provide services on its behalf or which are similar or ancillary to the services it provides.This funding includes the allocation of funds from the National Lottery Fund under its Vote.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	963	Psychoactive substances that are intended for inclusion in medicinal products must undergo extensive research and controlled trials in advance of being submitted for assessment of their safety, quality and efficacy by the Irish Medicines Board, the European Medicines Agency or similar agencies in other countries. Only if these criteria are satisfied will an authorisation be issued to permit a medicinal product to be legally placed on the Irish market. I am advised that the psychoactive substances that were available in head shops would not meet the criteria necessary to be considered for authorisation as medicinal products.In recent times, certain products available in head shops have been reported to have anaesthetic effects and therefore fall within the scope of the medicinal products legislation. Any such product is considered to be an unauthorised medicinal product and, accordingly, the IMB has been taking action to have these products removed from the market. The IMB can apply various sanctions in accordance with the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995, as amended.The supply of prescription only medicinal products by mail order, including via the Internet, is prohibited in Ireland. The IMB and the Revenue Customs Service work together closely in order to detect and detain such illegal supplies. These may include medicinal products with psychoactive properties. The IMB works with counterpart agencies in other countries to stop, wherever possible, the activities of websites and those who operate them. The IMB is active at both European and global level in maximising co-operation between agencies responsible for enforcement of medicinal products legislation.My Department is working closely with the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Gardaí, the Customs Service, the Forensic Science Laboratory, the IMB and others to monitor closely the emergence of new psychoactive substances with a view to bringing these substances under control. I will not hesitate to seek Government approval to ban additional substances if any of them pose a risk to public health.My colleague the Minister for Justice and Law Reform is currently progressing the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010 through the Dáil.  This Bill will make it a criminal offence to sell or supply substances which may not be specifically controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts but which have psychoactive effects.

In line with the Report, a ‘Palliative Care Services Medium Term Development Framework' was published by the HSE in July 2009. This Framework sets national priorities which have been agreed by all stakeholders based on solid needs analysis. The national priorities reflect the gaps that currently exist in particular areas and services, and the prioritisation reflects the largest gaps. The national priorities selected are aligned to national healthcare policy and the HSE's Transformation Programme and Corporate Plan. However, all developments are subject to current budget and economic considerations.As the specific issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

A payment was made in 2006 for €55,762.58 in relation to a settlement for VAT which had not been applied to a number of transactions in the period from 2004 to 2005.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.Officials from my Department recently met with the County Manager from Cork County Council to discuss options for progressing this project.  Cork County Council subsequently submitted a proposal to my Department.  I have now responded positively to the Council's proposal on this matter.

The Department's capital allocation for 2010 is €2,081 billion.In respect of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), since 2008 funding has been provided from my Departments current budget to cover operational payments for the NRA's first roads programme as follows:2008   €7,936 million2009   €7,936 million2010   €51 million (allocation)To date this year just over €5 million has been provided to the NRA for PPP operational payments.  I am advised by the NRA that in 2007 they made operational payments of €4.6 million in respect of one project.The management of PPP contracts for roads projects is a matter for the NRA having regard to Government guidelines and oversight by my Department.  Provision for PPP payments will be made each year in the annual estimates exercise in line with amounts notified by the NRA arising from the respective contracts.The Transport 21 investment framework runs until 2015.  However, because of the changed economic circumstances, it is now likely that not all of the projects originally identified in Transport 21 will be completed by 2015.  Therefore transport investment priorities have been reviewed.  These priorities, which are set out in the Renewed programme for Government, are as follows: Future national road priorities—the progression of the Atlantic Road Corridor, andthe improvement of other key strategic routes.Public transport priority—increased long term capacity, particularly throughthe construction of Metro Norththe construction of DART Underground and the implementation of the associated electrification, signalling and rolling stock investments. It is also a priority to continue planning other projects for earliest possible delivery when the economic situation improves.  No projects have been cancelled and Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework for capital spending on transport infrastructure into the future.

The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  The Commissioner's recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 11 June 2009.  This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner's recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.  The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person's appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner's earlier recommendation to reject his claim.  The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated 26 May 2010.In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant's file has been forwarded to my Department's Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the Asylum claim.  A letter will issue to him from my Department advising him formally that his asylum claim has been rejected and affording him three options as follows:1. Return home voluntarily2. Consent to the making of a deportation order, or3. Make written representations to me within 15 working days under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 and/or make an application for subsidiary protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 518 of 2006).

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	983	The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the applications for Garda vetting received from registered organisations are recorded by name and date of birth of the person for whom a vetting request is being made rather than by reference to geographical origin.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy.The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives — 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.  The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is in the region of 10 to 12 weeks given that demand is particularly high at present.

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against her and her two children.  Representations have been submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned.The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.

The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.However, if new information or circumstances have come to light, which has a direct bearing on his case and which have arisen since the original decision to sign the Deportation Order was made, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of the Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.  However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful.The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

"Advertisement" in this context is defined as including every form of advertising or promotion, including by way of computer monitor, telephone, photography or other like means of communication.However, I understand that difficulties arise in practice because the websites in question are hosted abroad.When I launched the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking in June 2009, I emphasised the Government's commitment to protect vulnerable people who may become victims of traffickers and to tackle the crime of human trafficking.  The Government has taken strong legislative, administrative and operational measures to combat and prevent trafficking in persons for both sexual and labour exploitation purposes.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 has greatly strengthened the law in this area.  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in February, 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is co-ordinated and comprehensive.  This has led to the production of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking.In addition, An Garda Síochána has established a Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit.  I am confident that the Force is vigorously pursuing enforcement of the law in this area.  The Garda authorities have conducted a number of operations to combat brothel keeping, prostitution and human trafficking and will continue to do so in line with the intelligence available to them.The law in relation to prostitution is kept under continuing review in my Department.

I refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Question number 90 of 3rd June, 2010 and Dail Question number 175 of 24th June 2010.  The position remains unchanged.  The person is recorded as having evaded her Transfer Order and is currently being sought by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  She should make herself known to them without further delay so that arrangements can be made for her transfer to Belgium.

It is likely, therefore, this application will be finalised in the early part of 2011.  It is not possible to state if the application will be favourably considered until all necessary processing has been completed.On 28 August 2009, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced changes in the way the State's immigration system deals with non-EEA migrant workers.From that date, all non-EEA persons who have held employment permits for 5 years of more consecutively and have been working lawfully during that time, will be exempted, provided they meet certain conditions, from the requirement to hold a work permit and will no longer be limited to one employer.  Such persons will be issued with a Stamp 4 permission signifying the right to be present in the State and to be employed without an employment permit.  Persons seeking such permission should contact their local Immigration office.  The eligibility rules are clearly laid out on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Office www.inis.gov.ie.This permission will normally be granted for one year and can be renewed annually subject to certain conditions, including that the person is continuing to be in employment or if redundant, he/she is making efforts to seek employment and has not become a burden on the State.  The person mentioned will be contacted in due course regarding their application.

I am informed that the DR Congo Embassy in London is the appropriate office to contact in relation to this.The person in question currently has permission to reside in the State based on the parentage of an Irish born child.A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in March 2008.All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straightforward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and this application will be considered first.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.The Deputy can be assured that the procedures followed and to be followed in the case of the person concerned are as set out in the relevant national asylum and immigration legislation and take account of the State's international obligations in this area.

This permission to remain is currently valid until 5 February, 2011.  I am further informed that there is no record of the person in question having registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  In the circumstances I would advise her to write to my Department at INIS, PO Box 10003, Dublin 2, outlining her circumstances.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.On 20 June 2008 the person concerned submitted representations to my Department seeking permission to remain in the State on the basis of his parentage of Irish citizen children.  Given that the closing date for the receipt of applications under the IBC/05 Scheme was 31 March 2005, the application of the person concerned was received too late for consideration and the person concerned was informed of this by letter dated 18 March 2009.In relation to the procedures invoked to date in the case of the person concerned, the position is that the asylum application he submitted was examined by the two statutory independent refugee status determination bodies, namely the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  In assessing each individual asylum application or appeal, the bodies referred to must, in accordance with their statutory remit, have regard for the specific claims made by an applicant as measured against objective, reputable, up to date information relating to the applicant's country of origin and, where doubts exist, the benefit of the doubt is applied in favour of the applicant.  I understand that copies of the determinations made by the two bodies were sent to the person concerned and to his then legal representatives so the person concerned will be able to see from those documents the basis for the conclusions reached in his particular case.Overall, I am satisfied that the State has a very fair and comprehensive mechanism in place for the consideration of all asylum applications and, as such, I am satisfied that the asylum application made by the person concerned was properly considered before a final decision to refuse it was taken.The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

In many countries in the EU possession of the Identity card is compulsory for all nationals of that state.  This sort of document should not however be confused with cards of a more limited function, e.g. public service cards.  In addition to its application within the borders of the issuing state, the national identity card has a further travel related function for nationals of EU member countries and also those from Switzerland and the EEA countries of Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.  For the purposes of entry to Ireland, national identity cards of Member States, and those other countries referred to above to whom the same rules apply, are acceptable under EU free movement rules essentially on the same basis as passports.  I have no plans at this time to introduce a national identity card system.  Any final judgement as to the necessity or desirability of such a system would have to include a full assessment of the implications of the introduction of identity cards in the UK as well as developments in the rest of the EU.

I am informed that the person in question attended his local Immigration Officer in February of this year and was refused further renewal of his permission to remain in the State as he had come to the adverse attention of An Garda Síochána.  The person concerned is therefore advised to write to my Department at INIS, PO Box 10003, Dublin 2, outlining his circumstances.  Upon receipt of such correspondence the person's case will be assessed by the relevant officials and he will be contacted directly and informed of any decisions made regarding his status in the State.

The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 made changes to both sections consequent on that judgment in accordance with legal advice.  Section 8 of the 1940 Act, as amended by the 2009 Act, sets out the current procedures for the enforcement of maintenance orders.  While the law generally operates successfully in this area my attention has been drawn to the fact that difficulties have arisen in some cases.  Consequently, I am currently in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to developing early proposals for amendments in respect of maintenance enforcement which may be included in the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.

My Department has a Legal Division, staffed by qualified legal professionals who provide legal advice on a wide range of international legal issues.  Having such in-house legal experts reduces the costs which would be incurred if the Department was to engage externally for similar services.  Nevertheless, there are from time to time occasions where a need to engage external legal services arises, where the necessary specialised expertise is not available within my Department and cannot be accessed from the AG or CSSO, for example in regard to advice relating to the lease or purchase of Embassy properties abroad. I have provided details in the following table on the costs for external legal services in respect of general and property related legal fees in Ireland and overseas.

Any associated fee costs are borne directly by those two Offices.However, on occasion and in exceptional circumstances, the Department, including the National Archives, may obtain legal services from other sources.  In each of the years since 2002 (the year in which the predecessor Department of my current Department was established), the fee costs associated with such other legal services are as set out in tabular form.The expenditure in 2008 and later relates primarily to legal fee costs associated with the specialised and complex Public Private Partnership processes to redevelop both the National Concert Hall and the National Theatre.   In the case of the agencies under the aegis of the Department, the securing of external legal services and the associated fee costs are a matter for the agencies themselves however I have requested the relevant information from the Agencies and will forward it to the Deputy.Year20021

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1021	Within the overall Governmental approach to meeting rural transport needs, my Department provided funding, on a pilot basis, between 2007 and 2009 for an evening/night-time rural transport service in seven selected areas. This pilot scheme was in addition to the rural transport services already provided in the seven areas under the Department of Transport's ‘Rural Transport Programme', which operates nationally.The pilot arrangement was intended to give the rural transport groups involved the opportunity to consider evening/night-time services for inclusion in their main transport services.My Department reviewed the pilot initiative and found that it had brought benefits to the areas covered and its alignment in due course with the mainstream Rural Transport Programme was desirable.Subsequently, at my Department's request, Pobal worked with the rural transport providers to assess how the evening services that they operated might be incorporated into the Rural Transport Programme.  In general, it was found that the groups involved had made good use of the pilot initiative to test various services and, where appropriate, were including evening services within their rosters.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1023	I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 to 204, inclusive, together.As part of the restructuring of Departments and agencies announced in March by the Taoiseach to ensure greater coherence and produce more efficient delivery, my Department incorporated responsibility for social inclusion policy and family policy from the Department of Social Protection and for equality, disability, integration and human rights from the Department of Justice and Law Reform. As stated by the Taoiseach in this context, it is important, while addressing the priority issues in responding to unemployment and driving economic recovery, that we do not lose sight of the importance of social development, the targeting of the most vulnerable and support for those working to make a difference right across our communities.My Department still has a wide agenda of reform to advance. The next phase, which is under way, concerns improving and joining up the outputs of programmes, as well as further consolidating structures.  The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme (LDSIP and CDP) were my Department's two main social inclusion and community development programmes and were delivered through separate local delivery structures. These programmes came to an end on 31 December 2009 and were superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).As the Deputy is aware, an implementation strategy involving the stakeholders is underway for LCDP roll-out over the course of 2010. Integrated workplans have now been developed by the local development companies and the CDPs covering all local development company areas. The next phase to the end of June covers the development of local integration plans for reduced structures from January 2011. The new programme will enable groups to more objectively demonstrate the positive impacts and outcomes they are securing to meet the needs of local communities.As the Deputy is aware, gross savings of some €57 million, or almost 12%, were achieved in the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) for the then Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Vote relative to the 2009 REV.  While the allocations in most expenditure programmes were reduced, the primary concern was to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services provided with funding from my Department were protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities.The Government's moratorium on staff recruitment and promotion and other associated measures, including the incentivised early retirement scheme, have achieved, and continue to achieve, reductions in staff numbers across my Department and relevant agencies.As I have previously indicated, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department — especially those providing tangible benefits for the most disadvantaged communities — are protected.

In addition, details of payments made from subheads part-funded from the National Lottery are listed on my Department's website.Against this background, the Deputy will appreciate that funding is provided each year to a very large number of individuals, groups, bodies and agencies. I do not consider that the allocation of staff resources that would be required to fully list and detail all of the applications and allocations, as requested, could be justified, particularly in the context where a significant amount of the relevant information is already available on my Department's website or in the annual Appropriation Accounts that are laid before the Oireachtas. If the Deputy has a particular query regarding specific groups, bodies or agencies, I will, of course, be happy to provide the relevant information to the extent feasible.

The Government is committed to seeking to maintain the State pension at 33% of average earnings. The framework includes a number of changes to the State pension in order to make it more transparent, simple and equitable for those who reach pension age.Recognising that people are living longer and healthier lives, the Government has decided to amend State pension age in three separate stages:In 2014, the State pension (transition) will be abolished.  The effect of this will be to standardise State pension age at 66;In 2021,  the State pension age will be set at 67; andFinally, in 2028, State pension age will be set at 68.For those people who wish to postpone drawing down their State pension, arrangements will be put in place to enable them to receive an actuarially increased benefit when they decide to retire.In addition, for those with contribution shortfalls at pension age, arrangements will be put in place to allow them to receive additional benefit at a later date if they continue to make paid contributions for pension purposes while remaining in work or self-employment.From 2012 social insurance credits will be introduced for people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  This will replace the current homemaker's disregard and will assist people — particularly women — to qualify for a contributory pension or a higher level of payment.In addition, from 6 April 2012, and as provided for in legislation since 1997, the minimum number of paid contributions required for State pension (contributory) will increase from 260 to 520.From 2020, the way in which eligibility for State pension is calculated will be simplified.  Specifically, there will be a switch from the way in which pensions are currently calculated over the average working life. Under the new system, the level of pension paid will be based on the total number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.A person will need to make contributions for 30 years to qualify for a maximum pension.  Once a person has the minimum number of paid contributions required, he or she will accumulate 1/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum 30 years.  Upon introduction of the total contributions approach, the maximum number of credits that can be used for pension purposes will be set at 520.An implementation group for the National Pensions Framework has been established by my Department and this group will work through the relevant issues in implementing the measures contained in the framework.

The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a statutory means test and a habitual residency test.The application for disability allowance, by the person concerned, was disallowed by a Deciding Officer of the Department on the grounds that he did not satisfy the statutory means test.The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal was opened on 6 May 2010 and following receipt of the relevant Departmental papers including comments on the grounds of appeal, the appeal from the person concerned will be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Any person who engages in voluntary work may continue to be entitled to jobseeker's benefit or allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.Examples of voluntary work in which jobseeker's may engage include:helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability;assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associations.The groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups.The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely — to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseeker's to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseeker's of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so. In addition, the existing Community Employment Scheme, operated by FÁS, offers the opportunity to unemployed persons to participate in paid employment in the social economy.The announcement by the Taoiseach of changes in Ministerial responsibility were made with a view towards achieving a better alignment of functions within and between Departments in order to deliver a better outcome for users of services and for the taxpayer. With regard to the functions being transferred to my Department, there will be an emphasis on reducing poverty, particularly by reducing dependency on social welfare payments among people of working age by promoting greater activation and participation. Bringing the various relevant programmes together within the remit of my Department will assist us in achieving these objectives.The transfer of functions and the associated development of services will take time to achieve. However, I am in ongoing consultation with community stakeholders and will be pushing ahead with a range of policy initiatives aimed at delivering opportunities for activation to those who are out of work.

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned has mortgage interest repayments of €48 per week but has no entitlement under the mortgage interest supplement scheme as their income exceeds the limits. This decision was upheld on 9th April, 2010 by the HSE's designated Appeals Officer It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision to the Social Welfare, Chief Appeals Office.The HSE has further advised that as an exceptional measure the person in question was awarded a supplement of €20 per week.

The first €20 of earnings for each day worked, up to a maximum of €60 per week, is disregarded from the average net weekly earnings, and 60% of the balance assessed. Net earnings are gross earnings less deductions for PRSI, superannuation/PRSA contributions and union dues.Prior to September 2007, earnings from employment were assessed as follows:Where a person had one or more qualified children, 60% of the average net weekly earnings were assessed as means;Where a person had no qualified children, the first €12.70 of earnings for each day worked was disregarded from the average net weekly earnings, and   60% of the balance was assessed as means.Net earnings were gross earnings less deductions for PRSI, income tax, health insurance premiums, superannuation/PRSA contributions and union dues. The pre-September 2007 arrangements were unchanged since the mid 1990s.

The total cost of the rent supplement scheme for 2009 was €511m.  Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable different types of eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions. Furthermore, it is essential that State support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords.Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at a higher level than are justified by the open market can have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn may worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes who are trying to support themselves without State aid.The recent changes to maximum rent limits were based on a review by my Department of nationwide rental prices in the private rental sector.  The Department will publish the main findings shortly.  The objective of this review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.The review was based on analysis on data on private rental prices supplied by the Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and publicly available data sources to determine market trends and current asking prices for one, two and three bedroom properties throughout Ireland on a county by county basis.  The only exception to this was Dublin, in which it was decided to isolate Fingal as a separate entity.The Department also received submissions from various stakeholders within the private rented sector. Discussions in relation to rent limits were also held with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and key local authority representatives in the context of the transfer of rent supplement tenants to local authority provided accommodation.It is expected that the reduction in rent limits should yield up to €20m in savings.  As the market adjusts to the new rates it is expected that further savings will arise, though this cannot be quantified.The maximum rent limits which were introduced recently are valid until December 2011. The Department will continue to closely monitor the rent levels in the private rental sector during the intervening period.  It is expected that the Department will commence a full review of rent levels within the third quarter of 2011 or earlier if required.

A subsequent appeal was made by him and the decision of the Deciding Officer was upheld by an Appeals Officer in May 2010.He had been in receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance and was paid to 23/6/10 while his appeal for Jobseeker's Allowance was pending. However as he was deemed not to be habitually resident within the state, this payment was terminated.The Community Welfare Officer in the Health Service Executive advised the person concerned of this and granted him an additional three weeks payment on compassionate grounds. The Community Welfare Officer further advised him that the Community Welfare Service were not in a position to make any further payments to him as he was deemed not to be habitually resident within the state.The person concerned does not have a work permit to engage in insurable employment and he cannot be treated as an EEA worker for the purpose of entitlement to Supplementary Welfare Allowance. He should contact the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform in order that issues regarding his status can be resolved.

A means-tested widow's or widower's non-contributory pension may be payable to those who are under 66 and who do not satisfy the social insurance conditions. State pension (non-contributory) is available to those aged 66 or over. If the person has qualified children, they may instead qualify for the means-tested one-parent family payment.A key condition for receipt of the widow's or widower's pension is that the person is the surviving partner of a married couple and thus the scheme differentiates as against the survivor of a cohabiting couple.  Confining the widow/ers contributory pension to married persons is not incompatible with the Equal Status Acts as married couples and cohabiting couples are not in an analogous position.

The methods of assessment of the liable relative's ability to pay are specified in detail in Regulations (S.I. 571 of 2006 and S.I. 142 of 2007). The financial and new dependency situation of each liable relative is assessed in detail. The assessment is based on the net weekly income (i.e. income from all sources less income tax and PRSI) with deductions for a personal allowance in respect of personal needs, a child dependant allowance in respect of each child living with the liable relative, and an allowance may also be granted in respect of the liable relative's accommodation costs. Any maintenance currently being paid to the one parent family recipient is also taken into account.

It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority's rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.Notwithstanding this, in the context of new provisions provided for by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, I intend to make regulations later this year which will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme.

However, anybody who paid the charge last year and provided an e-mail address has been sent an e-mail reminder in respect of possible liability in 2010.In addition, a number of local authorities have separately sent reminders to property owners registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  Local authorities have also undertaken advertising campaigns this year, both locally and nationally.  As this is a matter for the local authorities themselves, I do not have information on the costs of such advertising.  Payment of the charge may be made through the dedicated website www.nppr.ie as well as by post or over the counter at a local authority office.

Such criteria and conditions may, therefore, be included in the selection of technical specifications and award criteria, and in contract performance clauses.Accordingly, my Department's publication Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities –the best practice guidelines document for the Government’s Housing Policy, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities — state that: “Materials such as timber used in construction should be obtained from sustainably managed sources”.At EU level, the current emphasis is on ensuring that all timber entering the EU comes from legal sources. To this end, a new EU Regulation will require timber traders operating in the EU for the first time to operate "due diligence" systems as a further barrier to trade in illegal timber. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who has responsibility in this area, is negotiating this Regulation on behalf of Ireland. The provisions of this Regulation, when adopted, will be reflected in the Green Public Procurement National Action Plan being prepared by my Department in co-operation with the National Procurement Service in the Office of Public Works.The draft Green Public Procurement National Action Plan proposes to commit public authorities to verify that the timber they procure is both legal and sustainable. This may be demonstrated through any of the widely-recognised existing commercial certification systems, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC).  Under the above-cited EU public procurement directives, any other appropriate form of proof and verification that timber is legal and sustainable must also be accepted.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities and the HSE has responsibility in relation to health and care services for homeless persons. My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin action to address homelessness at local or regional level. Substantial work has been carried out in this regard during the past 2 years and a comprehensive range of measures has been put in place to support the role of housing authorities and other agencies in addressing homelessness.The overall national policy framework to address homelessness is set out in the Government's homelessness strategy, The Way Home , which was published in August 2008 and the National Implementation Plan for the strategy, which was published in April 2009. Implementation of the homelessness strategy at local and regional level will be carried out through the framework of statutory homelessness action plans adopted by housing authorities under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.Total funding for homeless accommodation and related services was increased in 2009 by 5% and in monetary terms to €62m, which represented a higher increase in real terms. Notwithstanding unavoidable retrenchment in State funding generally, this higher level of funding is being maintained in 2010, which is indicative of the priority that I and the Government attach to addressing homelessness.The process of implementing the provisions relating to homelessness in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 is well advanced, with the establishment of regional homelessness consultative fora and the development of the statutory homelessness action plans. These provisions further reinforce the role of the housing authorities, working with relevant statutory and non-statutory agencies, in the planning, implementation and oversight of homeless services and action to address homelessness as effectively as possible at local and regional level, in accordance with the objectives of the homelessness strategy.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.In working to compile the Register for 2007/08, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades. On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared with previous years. The task for local authorities, in relation to the preparation of the Register of Electors in subsequent years was to maintain and build on the progress made.Authorities were required to publish the final Register for 2010/11 by 1 February 2010.  Individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the Register up until 15 days before the next polling day.  Looking to the future, the Programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission. The renewed Programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirms this commitment and identifies a range of responsibilities which the Commission will be mandated to fulfil. The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.

Actual reserves, which are not expected to vary greatly from this figure, will not be known precisely until late in the field's lifetime after a considerable amount of historical production data has been collected.  The initial volumetric studies to determine the reserves of gas in the field were carried out by the former operator, Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited and have since been updated by the current operator. These studies have been audited by the Department.Based on the estimated reserves, total production of gas over the life of the Corrib gas field, would equate to approximately five years annual consumption of gas at Ireland's current level of consumption.  Production of gas will peak in the early years, where it is estimated by the Commission for Energy Regulation that the Corrib gas field would meet in the region of 60% of Ireland's annual demand for natural gas.The principal financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field will be through the tax system.  A special rate of corporation tax applies to profits from the production of oil and gas and in the case of the Corrib gas field profits will be liable to tax at a rate of 25%.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1073	I am deeply concerned with the level of safety on our farms and I fully support the work of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which is the national body in Ireland with responsibility for securing health and safety at work.  The HSA is also responsible for the collecting and recording of workplace accident data.The most recent CSO estimate for accidents in the agricultural, forestry and fishing sectors is for 2008. For that year the CSO estimate that there were approximately 1,900 accidents in these sectors. These figures are not broken down on a per county basis.Provisional figures for 2010 indicate that this year 14 people have already died as a result of accidents on Irish farms. Half of these fatalities occurred in the Cork, Kerry and Clare region with the remainder mainly in Midland counties and counties on the East Coast.I strongly support the HSA and Farm Safety Partnership's Farm Safety Action Plan 2009 — 2012. The Farm Safety Action Plan identifies 7 goals to prevent farm accidents and fatalities. It also contains the commitments given to farm health and safety by different organisations including the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1074	Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to protect expenditure for major developmental measures in the agri-food sector. To achieve this objective, savings had to be found in other areas and I decided, reluctantly, to reduce expenditure under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme for 2009 by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares. While overall expenditure on the Scheme has fallen, almost 67,000 farmers have not suffered any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit. The rates of payment, which were increased by 8% in 2007, remained unchanged for the 2009 Scheme.Notwithstanding the reduction in funding, the total amount available under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in 2009 was €220 million. This represented a substantial injection of funds to underpin incomes for farmers situated in these areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best-funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.The rates of aid for the 2010 Scheme have already been set and are as follows:Less Severely Handicapped Lowland and Coastal Areas with Specific Handicap: €82.27 per forage hectare;More Severely Handicapped Lowland: €95.99 per forage hectare;Mountain Type Grazing: €109.71 per forage hectare on first 10 hectares, or part thereof, and €95.99 per hectare on remaining forage hectares.The application period for the 2011 Scheme will open in early 2011 and no decisions have yet been taken at this stage on this Scheme.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1076	No circumstances arose in my Department that required an unprompted voluntary disclosure to be made to the Revenue Commissioners in the years 2005-2010.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1077	My Department did not make any settlements with the Revenue Commissioners in the years 2005-2009.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	The following tax audits were carried out by the Revenue Commissioners on my Department in the period 2005- 2010:A Value Added Tax audit took place in February 2005 and the Department's operations were found to be in order.A Relevant Contracts Tax audit took place in November 2005. The audit found that the Department was a principal contractor when it engaged hauliers to bring animals to a factory for slaughter under the various disease eradication schemes and should have operated the relevant contracts tax system on payments to the hauliers.  An incorrect operation was discovered which was corrected when brought to attention and no assessment was entered.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1079	An application under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 10 April 2009.The Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.  However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.The person named was written to by my Department on 23 July 2009 and again on 21 January 2010 and invited to submit appropriate evidence of the numbers of livestock maintained on his farm, as Department records currently do not show the person named as having yet achieved the minimum stocking density. To date, no reply has been received from the person named; however, on receipt of a satisfactory response, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1080	The new Grassland Sheep Scheme, which has a total budget of €54 million, will operate for three years: 2010, 2011 and 2012. This funding, which comes from the unused Single Payment funds, will provide a very important and timely boost to support incomes in the sheep sector over the next three years .
The Scheme has been kept administratively simple, which will facilitate the Department in making payments very shortly after the commencement date of 1 December 2010 (the commencement date for making payments under this Scheme in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU Regulations). Farmers will find participating in the Scheme relatively easy, the three requirements being to:maintain ewes;complete the Sheep Census return and submit it by the deadline set by my Department; andsubmit the SPS application form by the closing date of 17th May 2010.I can confirm that all breeding ewes over twelve months of age, including ewe hoggets  at the time of the December 2009 Census and returned as breeding ewes in the Census Form will be eligible for use in the calculation of the area of grassland benefitting from payment. Any female hoggets that were not eligible for inclusion as breeding ewes in the December 2009 Census will be eligible for inclusion in the 2011 Scheme provided that they are included in the December 2010 Census Form.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1081	The person named has 25 animals for consideration under the 2009 Suckler Welfare Scheme. It is a condition of this Scheme that for herds of more than 10 cows the calves must be weaned in at least two separate groups with each group being removed at a minimum interval of five days. The person named submitted an explanation regarding this issue but his comments did not warrant any deviation from the rules governing the Scheme. He was informed of this decision in a letter from the Unit dated 2nd June 2010. However, the person named has the right to appeal this decision as outlined in the above letter.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1082	No funding was received by my Department from the National Lottery in the period in question.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1083	Details of the amounts paid by my Department in legal fees for each of the years from 2000 to date in 2010 are being compiled at present and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.The amounts paid in legal fees by each of the agencies and bodies under the aegis of my Department are a matter for the agencies/bodies themselves.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1084	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal  skills.The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments.In managing the programme consideration is given to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme. FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.This Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I am keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1094	The July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July. My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided in which cases the parents have to source and fund a qualified teacher to undertake the tuition.  The cost of home based tuition is then reimbursed to the parents by my Department.There has been a steady increase in the number of schools offering the programme since its introduction.  In 2010, the common pay date has been changed from 30 September, as in 2009, to 11 November.  This decision was made after consideration of available staffing resources within my Department.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1095	Employed apprentices currently working on a short time basis are considered by FAS to still be in active apprenticeship training.  While each on the job training phase within an apprenticeship is of a specified minimum duration, apprentices who are working on a short time basis are not thereby precluded from completing their training within the specified period. In addition, in order to successfully complete the relevant on-the-job training phase, an apprentice is required to reach the minimum qualifying standard specified as certified by their employer.Apprentices who have not served the minimum time required as an apprentice over all seven phases of their apprenticeship but who have been certified as attaining the minimum qualifying standard by their employer, may submit a portfolio of evidence under Recognition of Prior Learning for consideration by the National Apprenticeship Advisory Sub-Committee. This option is also available to redundant apprentices and has been in operation since June 2009.

The school's design team is working on the Stage 2(b) submission.  My Department understands that an application for planning permission has been lodged and that a decision is awaited.  The school authority and its design team have indicated to my Department that they will submit their Stage 2(b) documentation (detailed design, planning permission, tender documents etc.) as soon as possible after planning permission has been received.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1106	I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing or in relation to a specific pupil I would suggest that they should contact the relevant local NEPS Regional Director, for whom contact details are available on my Department's website.The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the undertaking within the Renewed Programme for Government to an overall expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers to 210, currently NEPS staffing numbers stand at 157. In this regard a new recruitment competition was set in train in February last by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) in conjunction with my Department's Personnel Section in order to establish a new panel from which this recruitment may be progressed. Interviewing of shortlisted candidates is currently underway and it is envisaged that the vetting, interviewing and empanelling of suitable applicants will be completed in time to recruit new psychologists for the beginning of the new school year. This targeted expansion will ultimately allow to the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to all primary and post-primary schools and pupils nationally and afford a level of enhancement of service to Special Needs Units and Schools regionally.The assignment of a NEPS psychologist to the school referred to in the Deputy's question is a matter for consideration by the relevant NEPS Regional Director and will be subject obviously to the availability of suitably qualified personnel being empanelled in the above process for the relevant NEPS office.

With effect from 1 January 2009 functions in relation to Youth Affairs Section, including funding, were transferred from my Department to the Department of Health and Children. Other National Lottery funding disbursed by my Department supports Local Drugs Task Forces, Cultural Activities, the Irish Language and Adult Education.The Revised Estimates Volume published by the Department of Finance provides summary details of programmes part-financed by the National Lottery and disbursed by relevant Government Departments and Offices. The Revised Estimates Volume provides these details at Vote subhead level and broken down by capital and current allocation. The Volume identifies the aggregate amount of National Lottery funding towards the programmes in question, together with the amount of Exchequer funding. For example, the Revised Estimates Volume for 2010 (Page 243) identifies that total funding of €435.387 million was provided in 2009 to programmes which are part-financed by the National Lottery. Some €275 million was financed from the National Lottery, while the remaining €160.387 million was financed by the Exchequer.Payments in the year ended 31 December 2007€General Expenses of Youth Organisations and Other Expenditure in Relation to Youth Activities (Subhead B.9.)42,616,671Cultural Activities (Subhead B.14.)229,700Irish Language (Subhead B.10.)1,178,401Expenses of Adult Education Organisations (Subhead B.1.)929,000Total44,953,772Analysis of Payments from the Grant-in-Aid Fund for General Expenses of Youth Organisations  and Other Expenditure in relation to Youth Activities (Subhead B.9.)Assessor of Youth Work — Salary Costs79,124Belvedere Youth Project, Dublin60,000Causeway83,056Child Protection Training142,267Co-operation Ireland55,134Council of Europe English Language Course45,000Curragh Youth Project, Co.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1109	Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) forms a mandatory part of curriculum provision in primary schools and in junior cycle. The overall aim is to help develop students' confidence and self esteem, and promote the skills for living, for responsible decision making, and for mental, physical and emotional health and well-being. The junior cycle syllabus for SPHE includes a specific module on Substance Abuse.The implementation of these programmes in schools is supported by full-time support services at primary and second level which provide professional development for teachers and advice and support to schools. The second level support service is operated jointly with the Health Sector. A range of resources are available to support the programmes. These include the Walk Tall Programme at primary level, On My Own Two Feet at post- primary level, the Teacher Guidelines for SPHE developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, a Substance Misuse Prevention Information Booklet for schools and parents, Guidelines for Developing a School Substance Use Policy, including a policy template, and links and references to relevant websites.At second level, the SPHE Support Service also provides support and assistance to schools in the development of their Substance Use policies, and offers a resource directory, which includes the materials of the Teaching Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drugs Education in England. Copies of these materials were made available to the network of Education Centres around the country by the support service.In relation to the supports available to primary teachers, personnel have now been appointed to commence work with the newly formed Professional Development  Service for Teachers (PDST) that will provide support on a regional basis from September next. These personnel will form multi-disciplinary teams that will work in close co-operation with the Education Centre Network to respond to needs identified by schools in the region including support for the SPHE and the Walk Tall Programme where possible.In addition to this, the Transition Year Programme, which is available to schools on an optional basis provides a flexible menu of options designed to further support pupils' personal and social development, to provide a bridge between junior and senior cycle and to offer a broad educational experience which can aid the maturing process. As part of this, there is scope for schools to offer alcohol and substance misuse programmes.The central objective of a school substance use policy is the welfare, care, protection and education of every young person. The school policy can ensure schools have a coherent framework for providing appropriate education and managing issues relating to substance misuse in a planned and considered way.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1110	Financial assistance is available to students under the maintenance grant schemes, which are administered by the local authorities and Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department. Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.Under the terms of the Higher Education Grants Scheme, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. However, financial assistance is available to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.The progression route at postgraduate level, for grant purposes, is as follows: Higher Diploma/Postgraduate Diploma; Masters; PhD/Doctorate.  Candidates who hold a diploma qualification and are pursuing a second diploma qualification cannot be considered for funding.However, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level Colleges and Universities in the State and any other E.U. Member State. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from a candidate's local tax offices or on Revenue's website at http://www.revenue.ie.

The data on post-primary students in County Meath are extracted from the returns made by schools to my Department each year as at 30th September. The enrolment figures provided exclude Post Leaving Certificate(PLC) and CoreVTOS students.The data on primary students in County Meath are extracted from the primary census returns made by schools to my Department each year. The enrolment figures include students in special classes. The primary census returns for 2009/10 are still being processed and data in respect of 2009/10 will not be available until later this year.In respect of the data requested on teachers the Deputy should note that there is an extensive amount of statistical information for recent years on my Department's website in relation to the overall level of teachers in schools.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1115	The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) with statutory responsibility to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The remit of the Board was expanded in 2009 to include responsibility for the Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST), the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP) as well as the National Educational Welfare Service (EWS) under one common management team. The new integrated approach will provide for better targeting of children who are not benefiting from education and it will ensure that these children are properly supported to maximise their educational potential through improved attendance at and participation in school. It also provides new opportunities for enhanced support for parents and families.The NEWB has a key role in supporting parents and guardians where they are experiencing difficulties with school placement, attendance or participation in school. In addition the NEWB has, in the past, issued information leaflets to parents and run public awareness campaigns to raise the profile of school attendance and related matters. It also operates an Education Helpline to provide information on attendance and related matters.Frontline staff of the Board are deployed nationally and are a key means by which the Board delivers on its statutory remit. Through its service delivery staff, the Board works with approximately 8,000 children each year, who are reported as having serious school attendance, placement or participation difficulties or who have been expelled from schools. Staff work closely with families, schools and other support services to address the particular issues for each child.I am advised by the NEWB that on first contact with a family, an Educational Welfare Officer establishes what other statutory and non statutory services are involved. In cases where the Health Service Executive (HSE) has an involvement with a family there is active engagement between EWOs and local and regionally based HSE personnel.The NEWB also confirms that where there are child welfare protection concerns, referrals and child protection notifications are made to the HSE in line with the NEWB's Child Protection Guidelines.Under Section 25(8)(b) of the Education (Welfare) Act, there is an obligation on the Board to inform the HSE where a parent* is convicted of failing to ensure that their child attends school. In addition, the Board must also inform the HSE where a parent shows in the legal proceedings that he/she has made all reasonable efforts to cause the child to attend a recognised school. I am informed by the NEWB that these notifications are issued as a matter of course.Finally, the NEWB is committed to developing protocols with other professional services and agencies that will promote collaborative ways of working to improve attendance, participation and related issues.The NEWB confirms that it is actively engaged with the HSE in developing national protocols which are aimed at putting in place earlier warning systems, increasing awareness of the role for each agency and resolving any practice issues around frontline services to ensure consistency of approach in supporting children and families."Parent" as defined under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, includes a foster parent, a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Children Acts, 1964 to 1997, or other person acting in loco parentis who has a child in his or her care subject to any statutory power or order of a court and, in the case of a child who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, or, where the child has been adopted outside the State, means the adopter or adopters or the surviving adopter;
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1116	The provision of an Early Start pre-school for Traveller children would be contrary to the recommendations set out in the 2006 Traveller Education Strategy.   This strategy built on earlier reports, including the 1995 Task Force on the Travelling Community which specifically recommended the end of segregated provision at all levels of the Education system.  This includes the pre-school sector.With the introduction in January 2010 of universal pre-school provision (ECCE scheme) for all children,  all children, whether from minority or majority groups are entitled to a free pre-school year of appropriate programme-based activities in the year before they start primary school.  There are sufficient places available for pre-school children within community and private pre-schools.   Adding a segregated Early Start unit for Traveller children would be contrary to principles of inclusion and against the recommendations of an agreed strategy.
