I have selected the matters raised by Senators Morrissey, McHugh and McCarthy and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	2	What is the status of No. 25 on the Order Paper, a motion in the Leader's name calling for the removal of Judge Curtin from office?  Since the establishment of the committee inquiring into the matter, I have made no public comment because I wanted the committee to do its work and to ensure its report would be made to all Members without prejudicial comment that might influence those of us who may have to come to a final determination on the report and its evidence.  This has now been short-circuited by the judge's decision to resign from the Bench.  I express my thanks and appreciation to the committee members who worked tirelessly, meticulously and painstakingly over the past two years to ensure the procedures they adopted were fair and above reproach.There can be no satisfaction on this issue.  It is clear under Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution that the Houses of the Oireachtas have the power to impeach a member of the Judiciary for stated misbehaviour.  In light of this affair, we now need to put in place legislation to give effect to that constitutional right of the Oireachtas.  We also need to put in place a judicial code of conduct to make abundantly clear the rights and responsibilities that apply to all members of the Bench.The manner in which this matter has been handled is a matter of regret.  In effect, we asked the members of the committee to do an impossible task.  In hindsight, it is a task we should have done ourselves when the information was placed before both Houses.I record my appreciation to those Members who did their work in such a diligent manner over the past two years.  It is interesting that the judge, who was able to give clear instruction to his legal counsel over the past two years to take actions in the High and Supreme courts, has now decided to resign for medical reasons.  Is the Government accepting that resignation and his decision to resign on medical grounds?I move that No. 27, item 23, a Private Members' motion in the name of Senator Browne and others on the Leas Cross issue, is debated following the conclusion of No. 1 on the Order of Business.  Some 18 months after this saga was brought to public attention by the "Prime Time" programme, firm guarantees on a dedicated inspectorate which would enter nursing homes to audit procedures and standards have not been honoured and a uniform policy has not yet been established.  This House should debate the matter today.  The question of whether the Minister for Health and Children will attend is of scant importance for me because all the Ministers responsible for this matter have been sitting on their hands for the past 18 months.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	3	As someone who has regularly raised the Curtin affair over the past two years, I believe this House should give thanks to the members of the Committee on Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, who worked tirelessly to do all that was required of them.  I never thought they would be able to conclude their work because the cards were repeatedly dealt to the other side of the table and too many options were available to people who wished to scuttle the committee.  That, however, does not take away from the extraordinary work they have done and they deserve our thanks for giving up two summers to deal with the matter.  I have said they would be used as the wedge between the parties and left to carry the can but I am glad this has not been the case.  They can at least take pride in their work.Will the Leader consider a debate on the fourth report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution, which addressed the issue of removing a judge?  The committee also produced a draft Bill on the issue.  In the aftermath of the O'Flaherty business, we held similar discussions on how these matters should be addressed.  When we failed for the second time two years ago, I recommended that we would at least try to avoid getting it wrong a third time.  We should move immediately to follow that advice by debating the report of the joint committee and by asking it to continue its work.  Having spent two years considering the matter, the committee's members are now the only people in the Oireachtas with expertise of any description in this area.  They should be given the draft Bill which was published some years ago in order to report on whether they feel it is adequate to deal with the situations they have encountered over the past two years.  We should harness their expertise to ensure everything is in place to deal with potential future problems in an efficient and statutory way.

As was the case with the DIRT inquiry and other investigations, its work demonstrates that empowered Members of the Oireachtas can address issues and serve natural justice with a level of capacity and skill that does not seem to be evident outside these Houses.  The only Member of the Oireachtas who managed to make a mess of matters was the former Tánaiste, who undermined the trial of a former Taoiseach by finding him guilty before the proceedings even started.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Members of the Oireachtas are apparently more capable of understanding the nuances of sub judice  than are members of the Cabinet, despite the high powered advice given to the latter.  I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Brian Hayes.  This issue is not just about history.  The Health Service Executive has now insisted that there be no further admissions to a number of nursing homes because of HSE concerns about standards in those nursing homes but it will not tell us the number involved or their location, nor will it identify them to the families concerned.  In spite of all the glowing words, promises and acts of contrition etc., which never got as far as a mea culpa — it was a collective culpa in that no individual was ever responsible for anything in the health service — the HSE has admitted some nursing homes are causing concern because of the standard of care but it will not identify them or the number involved.  For anybody who has an elderly parent or other relative in a private nursing home, that ought to be a matter of great concern but the response of the HSE is to leave everybody worried.  That shows a lack of good will, which is the reason we need an urgent debate on the report.There is a separate issue on which I believe an urgent Government response is needed.  Five hundred members of Amicus are on strike today because of the disgraceful decision of Bank of Ireland to act in breach of every principle of industrial relations on which partnership is based.  As one who believes in a true partnership I am getting fed up of the annual ritual of some major employer here finding a loophole through which they can escape their commitments.  Effectively, Bank of Ireland is preserving the joys of a defined benefit pension for its senior, important people and depriving its new recruits of the same guaranteed secure pension.  If an organisation as successful as Bank of Ireland gets away with ignoring the Labour Court and proper procedures and condemning its employees to a future of insecurity in their old age, we can forget about partnership because that sort of activity effectively amounts to class warfare between those who are rich, powerful and in control of capital in this country and those whom they employ.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Will the Leader organise a debate, without delay if possible, with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine the Department's policy regarding speed restrictions in built-up areas?  Great concern has been expressed in built-up areas, particularly in some of the newer communities, where speed limits apply but there are no speed restrictions in place.  It is important that we put in place the necessary funding to ensure existing housing estates are provided with speed ramps.  Some local authorities indicate they do not have sufficient resources to do that but the Department should allocate those resources.  Also, speed restriction facilities should be part of the planning guidelines for new estates.  Much work was done in this and the other House in terms of road safety.  Real difficulties are being faced in some built-up areas, particularly in housing estates where boy racers use the facilities there to avoid police activity and put in jeopardy the lives of very young children.  Many housing estates now have a limited amount of green areas and children are forced to play in culs-de-sac and on the road.  The lack of speed restrictions in these areas means we are heading towards a dangerous precedent and the potential for loss of life.  We should act now as part of the overall road strategy.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not moved as quickly as it should on this issue, particularly in terms of putting in place guidelines that would be helpful to ensure planning authorities could make these restrictions part of future planning permissions.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Yesterday, The Irish Times published a comprehensive listing, on a county by county basis, of the main feeder schools to third level institutes and universities throughout the country.  The fee-paying schools, particularly those in Dublin, were on top of the list, which demonstrates the imbalance that exists.  A hidden factor in the statistics is that many of the fee-paying schools do not take in special needs students and those that do provide few if any resources for them.  I have asked on previous occasions that the Minister rectify this as a matter of urgency.  She has failed to do so over the past two years.I ask that we have an urgent debate on education, particularly highlighting the unfair circumstances whereby most pupils with special needs are in disadvantaged schools throughout the country.  I hope the Minister will properly resource special needs teachers and address the inequity that exists, which represents a glaring anomaly according to the article in yesterday's newspaper.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I was totally incensed by an article I read in The Irish Times last Friday.  It stated an off-licence in a supermarket had sold two bottles of vodka to two 15 year olds on the night on which the junior certificate results were released.  The case was heard in court and the off-licence was fined €100.  It later came to the attention of the judge that mandatory closure applies in all cases where under-age customers are sold alcohol.  The off-licence was therefore directed to close between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., that is, for two hours.  I believed this was a joke and that we must not be reading the decision correctly.We frequently talk in the Seanad about youngsters behind the wheels of cars, which are lethal weapons.  Surely a bottle of vodka in the hands of a 15 year old girl or boy is a lethal weapon.  In view of this the judgment is a crying shame.  When we next deal with legislation relevant to this issue, I ask that provision be made for further security and restrictions in the issuing of licences, particularly to off-licences associated with supermarkets.Senators Dardis, Finucane and I served on the Joint Committee on Article 35.4.1°. of the Constitution and Section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, which achieved a great deal.  For two and a half years, it sat in camera and its members were not allowed to speak about matters discussed.  There were no recordings of its meetings.  The committee met on 37 occasions and all its members had to be present for it to meet.  It was like a court in that we could not carry on our business if one member was missing.  The committee dealt with potential legal and constitutional difficulties associated with impeachment and they have all been resolved.  A roadmap has been created to allow for hearings if a similar case occurs again.  New cases will not be tied up in the courts, as was the one in question.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I support the calls for a debate on the Leas Cross report.  More than 100 people, which is a large number, seem to have died in the nursing home, some of whom apparently died unnecessarily.  It seems the inspectorate is not working.  I am particularly concerned about public facilities that care for the elderly, which are not inspected satisfactorily at all.  We should have the Minister in the House to outline the level of inspection of State facilities.I raise this issue because I had an interest in a patient in such a facility.  As far as I could establish, the patient was reasonably well looked after but she developed bed sores.  Most people believed, in their ignorant way, as I did, that bed sores just meant an old person was uncomfortable.  However, they are a very serious matter and this became known after the revelations about Leas Cross.  The woman in question was eventually hospitalised and died as a result of her bed sores.  People are not aware of this problem.  I am alarmed and concerned that the situation in these public institutions might be quite difficult.May I also ask for a debate on the Shell to Sea campaign in light of the Taoiseach's extraordinary remarks at the weekend?  He said, more or less, that dialogue was over and that no further correspondence on this issue would be entertained.  I wonder about the fact that he seems to be aligning himself and the Garda with a malign multinational corporation.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I saw footage down in Limerick at the weekend — I was at a police conference — of people being baton-charged.  The police issued an edict that a perfectly legal and peaceful protest was to be banned.  The people who were protesting were then baton-charged.  I spoke to an independent reporter who had been asked what he was doing while he was standing on a ditch.  When he said he was doing his professional work, he was batoned and kicked into the ditch and his camera was smashed.  I ask the Taoiseach to remove the plough and the stars from his shoulders because he has certainly done in his socialist credentials.  I wonder whether we will be treated to Government-sponsored evictions on behalf of banks and building societies as well.Can we have a debate on the road tunnel?  It has been announced that it will open on 20 December next.  Serious concern has been expressed by the Irish Road Haulage Association, the members of which have a heavy professional commitment in this area, that dangerous flammable and toxic materials, including liquids, will be carried through the tunnel without the precautions which are in place in other countries.  The road hauliers pointed out that when such materials have to go through much shorter tunnels in Britain, for example, the whole area is cleared and they are brought through in a convoy with flashing lights and with vehicles in front and behind, etc.  The response of the man representing the civic authorities here was lamentable. He quoted statistics and said it was statistically unlikely an accident would happen.  The problem with accidents is that they cannot be predicted.  In light of what the road hauliers have said, it seems we would not be properly prepared if we had an accident here.  We should bear in mind that fireballs have been experienced in some continental tunnels.  The House would do the nation a service if it were to examine this issue and to consider whether the potential dangers and hazards could be avoided.

The most important inspectorate of all consists of the family members who visit their loved ones in private or public nursing homes, as well as the doctors and other professionals who tend to the residents of such homes.  An inspectorate will not solve everything, regardless of whether it is established under new legislation.  The issues which were raised in the Leas Cross report are extremely grave and serious.  It is right that these matters were investigated by Professor O'Neill and the HSE.  It is right that the House should have a debate on the Leas Cross report and on nursing homes generally.  All of us who served on health boards must ask how we administer the responsibilities delegated to us under the Health Act 1970.  As far as I am concerned, I have nothing to be afraid of in any investigation of the Western Health Board.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Supreme Court gave a ruling this week on the so-called baby Ann case and there has been much public comment on it.  There is an issue at the heart of the case about the rights of children, including the question of a constitutional amendment.  Can we have an opportunity to debate the issues arising from the Supreme Court judgement in advance of the publication of the proposed wording of that amendment?  A consultation process has begun on this with the non-governmental organisation sector, but we could provide a valuable contribution to the debate if we had an opportunity to discuss the issue in this House.I asked the Leader some time ago to schedule a debate on youth mental health issues.  Has she had an opportunity to do this?  I raised a number of these issues with her.  I would also like to her to schedule a debate on hospital policy in this House with the Minister for Health and Children in light of remarks by the Minister in a meeting with representatives from Monaghan.  There is one representative from that area in this House.  She told them that it was the policy of the Government to implement the Teamwork report, which is a replacement for the Hanly report.  This will see the closure of the hospital in Monaghan and the downgrading of acute services there, but it will also see the closure of acute and emergency services in small hospitals throughout the country.

She said it is Government policy.  We need to debate that in the House because it has implications for hospitals and people's lives throughout the country.  The Leader must ensure that such a debate takes place.  With the Health Service Executive, HSE, in place, there is no avenue for public representatives to influence this kind of policy.  We must have this debate and I will continue to insist that we have it.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I join those Senators who have commended the diligence and work of the committee that dealt with the Judge Curtin affair.  The Chairman stated yesterday that it was time for us to examine how best we could put a mechanism in place to deal with these issues effectively and expeditiously.  There have been other instances in which people have resigned and a less severe outcome would have been more appropriate in the circumstances.  In other jurisdictions, there are effective mechanisms that deal with the disciplining of inappropriate behaviour by members of the Judiciary.  We should examine those mechanisms quite closely.The mechanisms also ensure some consistency in sentencing.  In that respect, I pay tribute to the Director of Public Prosecutions who stated that there is a need for giving explanations in cases where sentencing is at variance with what may be regarded publicly as the norm.  These explanations would be given to ensure that public confidence is maintained in the system.  Following the attendance of the DPP at the child protection committee, everybody was impressed with the substance of his contribution on what is a complex area.  Will the Leader organise a debate on these issues as a matter of urgency?
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I commend the commitment of Members in both Houses who were on the Curtin investigation team.  Everybody knows how diligently they approached their task.  However, they were up against it, particularly in view of the earlier court decision to acquit the defendant and the very able team that he retained, which included a former Attorney General.  Written guarantees regarding personal integrity are also enshrined in the Constitution.  I congratulate the committee members; perhaps, as has been suggested, there is a more important task that might suitably be entrusted to them by the Oireachtas.Regarding the matter raised by Senator Ryan, I too felt that the decision made by one of Ireland's major financial institutions was most unfortunate.  Given what we are trying to inculcate in people and the great deficiencies in pension provision in this country, it is frightful that such a major financial institution should yellow-pack its staff and deny people their pension entitlements.

The matter underlines once again the almost infinite resources available to those who wish to slow the wheels of justice to prevent a decision being reached expeditiously.  However, I hope that its work will shorten any future such procedures.We should debate the Leas Cross report but while private, for-profit nursing homes are vital, we should be under no illusion that they are necessarily the panacea for every problem in the health service.This House, like the other, exists so that contentious problems and issues are not fought out on the streets or in other ways but debated and decided here.  Without any of the emotive argument on either side, it is high time that we debated the issue in Mayo relating to the Rossport five.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The United Nations has designated next Sunday, 19 November World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims.  It is an ideal opportunity for the country to focus the attention of all new road users.  However, I understand that there is no official Government plan to recognise it.  It is outrageous that we should forgo the opportunity to draw attention to the occasion.  One man who lost his daughter and her boyfriend four years ago is having to do it single-handedly at Tullyesker on the road between Drogheda and Dundalk.  He lost his daughter on the same day, 19 November, and because of that fact he is doing the job on his own, circulating posters and drawing attention to the occasion.This is an ideal opportunity for the Government to do something in this regard.  I am amazed that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, should have been quoted in a newspaper as saying that there are no official plans.  I ask him to reconsider at this last moment and draw attention to this important occasion.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	42	On behalf of its members, I thank Senators for recognising the work of the Joint Committee on Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution and Section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924.  I note in particular the contribution of the Chairman, Deputy O'Donovan.  It is a tribute to him that we were so successful in arriving at a point where we were about to hear the evidence.  I also thank Dr. Gerard Hogan, counsel to the committee, the legal team and the secretariat.Certain lessons have been learnt.  As I understand it, the judge's resignation is irrevocable and was made on the basis of stated incapacity to serve rather than misbehaviour, which was what the committee was investigating.  Given that Mr. Curtin is no longer a judge, the work of the sub-committee has come to an end.  However, it has prepared a report and I expect this will be laid before the Houses.  There is a resolution on the Order Paper, which remains current.  I am sure the Leader will deal with it and that the House will dispose of it later.There is probably some merit in examining Standing Orders and how they relate to matters of this nature.  The Houses were vindicated in respect of the way the motions were drawn up, Standing Orders amended, etc.  However, perhaps there might be merit in the Committee of Procedure and Privileges reviewing Standing Orders in the context of the narrow issue of impeachment.  The Chairman of the sub-committee of which I am a member has requested that a judicial council be established as a matter of urgency.  In other words, there should be an independent way of dealing with behaviour, etc. which falls short of the required standard.  I understand the relevant legislation is in an advanced state of preparation and that consultation is taking place with the Judiciary in respect of it.  I hope the legislation will be brought before the Houses in the near future.  As Senator Feeney stated, we are in a much better position and if these unfortunate events were to recur, we would be able to deal with them in a far more expeditious manner.  It is worth recalling that we spent in the region of 16 months in the courts and this hindered the work of the committee to a significant degree.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I raised the issue of pensions in the past two weeks and requested a debate in respect of it.  I take no pleasure from raising it again today.  However, the Taoiseach stated last week that employers have got it wrong in respect of pensions.  I presume he was referring to how they are changing their pension schemes from those based on defined benefits to those based on defined contributions.  I am amazed the Taoiseach informed employers they got it wrong.  In my view, he, the Government, the Pensions Board and the pensions industry have got it wrong.  The Taoiseach must take responsibility for changing legislation to allow employers to do what they are now doing.  I do not condone what employers are doing and I made that point on several occasions in the House.  However, they are doing nothing wrong and are able to use the legislation to their own benefit.  The Government, the Taoiseach and the Pensions Board have not taken action to protect the interests of workers.Before coming to the Chamber, I listened to "Liveline" with Joe Duffy.  Pensioners who previously worked in the public service, in State and semi-State bodies and in the private sector rang in to complain about their pensions.  These people are at last waking up to the fact that they have been let down by the Government, which is responsible for looking after the interests of future pensioners — it is not doing so — and encouraging young people to take out pensions.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I welcome the report on the Leas Cross nursing home.  I understand the nursing home subvention is much higher in the eastern part of the country than it is in, for example, the western region.  We must address this issue.  I advocate the home-care package, which has been very beneficial and under which up to €150 million was provided in the last budget.  That money should be available for patients everywhere, regardless of whether they remain at home or are placed in nursing homes.  Families are aware of the good care that has been provided in many nursing homes.  I am aware the home care package costs money but I believe it must be retained.If any Minister has spoken about the matter of pensions more than any other it is the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.

It is also an abuse of staff, which must be stopped.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I concur with Senator Mansergh that private nursing homes are not the panacea for problems within the health service, but the Minister for Health and Children and her officials seem to think otherwise as these homes are repeatedly being used, often unsuitably, to solve the situation in the acute hospitals.  It would be far preferable if step-down facilities were built throughout the country.Will the Leader try to arrange a debate before Christmas on the report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention?  I have asked about this previously and I am sure the Leader has tried to obtain the report.  A new, improved Prisons Bill will come forward next week but it would be a good idea if we debated the situation as is and, as the inspector and the visiting committees have seen it, before we consider the Bill.

I understood that yesterday's article related to access to third level.  The Deputy is correct that many schools on the list did not provide access for special needs students.  I spoke to the Minister just yesterday in this regard.  She is dealing with the problem and acknowledges that some feeder schools are not allowing access for special needs students.  We should have a debate in which the Minister could reassure the House in this regard.  She has spoken about it in the field.

For example, the Longford Association for the Mentally Handicapped pointed out at its annual general meeting yesterday that it paid a whopping €157,000 in VAT last year when it was attempting to equip its unit with essential equipment.

I agree partially with Deputy Ulick Burke that it is disturbing to read about the ongoing practice among certain schools to cherry-pick students.  Like most Members, I have plenty of anecdotal evidence of this practice.  Education is supposed to be about making the world a better place for all our children and future generations.  Cherry-picking flies in the face of that core principle.  It must be condemned because it is a reprehensible practice, which must be stopped for many reasons.  This practice means the schools involved almost totally disregard their special educational needs provision, which is vital, and that cannot be allowed to continue.Cherry-picking also has a polarising effect within the education system.  I love excellence in education but I hate elitism.

I disagree with Senator Ulick Burke's assertion that the Minister for Education and Science has done nothing about it.  As Senator Ormonde correctly said, the Minister has confronted this issue vociferously and she has taken action.  She has set in motion an audit of the enrolment policies of our schools.

It is vital that the House debates the future of accident and emergency departments throughout the State.I support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Brian Hayes, which calls for a debate on the Leas Cross report.  The issue was first mooted 18 months during a "Prime Time" programme, although Deputy O'Dowd raised it as far back as 1999 when he was a Member of this House.  We have waited a long time for action.  The Government was quick to introduce legislation to charge people in nursing homes, yet 18 months after the Leas Cross scandal was exposed, legislation to address the issues raised still has not been brought forward.  This is not the way to do business.  Senator Norris referred to inspection teams, which are needed.

The committee and its membership have ceased to be because the person in question is no longer a judge of the Circuit Court.  The motion will be withdrawn by a motion in my name.  The committee's report has been prepared and, as stated when the committee was established, the report will be laid before both Houses.  The Senator thanked the committee's members.Despite what happened, the work of the committee is interesting because a roadmap on how to deal with such matters has been laid out and an acceptable template has been put in place.  It is good that the committee's hard work and its members' attendance will not have been in vain.  It has been proven that a joint committee has the power to impeach a member of the Judiciary.  Senator Brian Hayes was right to mention a code of conduct for the Judiciary.  Senator Dardis mentioned various measures that are in place or will be rolled out.Senator Brian Hayes proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, as he is entitled to do.  The amendment has been seconded and there will be a vote.  I cannot fetch a Minister just like that.  While the Senator stated that there would be no need to do so, I have always held that a Minister should be in attendance when we have debates.

This morning, we were busy in that regard, but the Senator has every entitlement to table his amendment.Senator O'Toole called for a debate on the fourth report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution.  He asked that the draft Bill be converted into a proper Bill, debated and enacted.  This would be worthwhile because it would be helpful.Senator Ryan stated that Members have proven to be fit members of a committee.  While he is entitled to raise any matter, I am sure that I speak for many in the House when I say that I did not like his reference to the former Tánaiste.  The Senator seconded Senator Brian Hayes's——

If I may say so, the issue was raised in a malicious fashion.  Senator Ryan seconded Senator Brian Hayes's proposal on the Leas Cross nursing home.  He also——

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Regarding the bank strike, a representative of the Bank of Ireland was asked on "Morning Ireland" today whether the bank's new human resources specialist would be employed on the basis of the yellow pack pension.  While the answer was "Yes", it was interesting that he stated the pension is not a yellow pack one.  Nevertheless, I agree with Senator Ryan that there is meant to be true partnership.  How can there be partnership when the bank can have an escape clause when it wants one?Senator Dooley raised the issue of speed restrictions in built-up areas.  Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the list of schools in The Irish Times.  I perused the list yesterday and it showed the schools with the highest rates of progression to third level education.  One of the very highest is a non-fee-paying school, my old school, St. Joseph’s in Summerhill in Athlone which has 600 pupils.  It is in a huge special needs catchment area and has many such pupils.  It has a wonderful principal and teachers.  Some so-called posh schools do not encourage the enrolment of special needs pupils, which is wrong.  A school gains by having people of different abilities because of the fact that they interact with other pupils.  Many of the schools on the list were non-fee-paying.  The Senator suggested that many semi-posh schools do not want special needs pupils.  However, the Minister is carrying out an audit of enrolment and under the Education Act 1998, schools have a duty to accept a child who presents.  We are trying to organise a debate on education.Senator Feeney told of the two 15 year olds who were able to buy two bottles of vodka.  The penalty for the shop was only a fine of €100 and closure for two hours, from 2. p.m. until 4 p.m.  The Senator suggested better regulation of off-licences.With regard to the Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 committee, Senator Feeney said there was now a road map for the purpose for which it was established.  I congratulate the Senator and Senators Dardis and Finucane, the three Members of this House who did their duty on the committee.Senator Norris asked for a debate on Leas Cross and the level of inspection at public nursing homes.  He also raised the issue of the Shell to Sea campaign.  I agree with Senator Cummins that gardaí have a job to do.  Whatever the rights and wrongs of the issue they are sorely tried on a daily basis by the demands to keep the peace.  I have friends in that area and around County Mayo and they tell me that many people are heartily fed up of the whole thing and wish it would stop.  We cannot blame gardaí for everything when they have to maintain the law.Senator Leyden raised Professor O'Neill's report on Leas Cross and said many Members of the House were members of health boards.  I do not know how health boards operated because I never sat on one.  I agree it is a huge and grave issue.  We are all destined to get old and one tends to think, "There but for the grace of God go I."   We saw many people on "Prime Time" being ill-treated or abused so we must debate it thoroughly.  I am incensed about the fact that nobody has said, "Lámh in airde", or, "I am to blame", and I do not know if accountability will emerge, given that the Minister for Health and Children could not publish the report for some time to allow people to discuss it.Senator O'Meara raised the case of baby Ann and asked about youth medical health issues.  What is the name of the body to which the Senator referred?

I will endeavour to arrange a debate.  The Senator also said the Teamwork report was now a code for the Hanly report and I think she is right.  She asked for a debate but I was struck by an article the Minister for Health and Children wrote — I think it was in The Irish Times — in which she said what was best for the patient was the best way to proceed.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Senator Jim Walsh commended Senators for their work on the Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 committee and referred to measures in other jurisdictions.  Senator Coghlan also praised the work of the committee.  He mentioned the Bank of Ireland dispute.Senator Mansergh commended the Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 committee.  He also called for debates on Leas Cross and the Rossport five.  It would be a good idea to have a debate on the Rossport five but we need to know something about it, because we do not know much at the moment.  Perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows more, as he is from Mayo.  I am looking around for other Senators who may be of help.Senator Feargal Quinn raised next Sunday's UN day of remembrance for those who have died in road accidents.  I commend Charlie Bird, which I do not do often.  Once a month he produces a list of all those who died on the roads in the previous month, giving their names, ages and date of death.  It is very chilling and very effective.Senator Dardis praised the chairman of the Joint Committee on Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution and Section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, Deputy O'Donovan.  He also referred to the need for a judicial counsel and looked forward to future legislation in this regard.Senator Terry has been consistent in her interest in pensions.

We will endeavour to arrange a debate.  She said that pensions should be protected though I do not agree that everyone she named got it wrong.  We have tried all morning to arrange a debate on Leas Cross for next week and we have also been trying to get the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to come to the House to discuss pensions.Senator Kitt raised the different rates of subvention between the east and west coasts.  Senator Henry said private nursing homes were not the panacea we all thought they were.  She wanted the report of the inspectorate, for which we keep asking.  Senator Ormonde asked for a debate on pensions and raised the question of third level feeder schools.  I agree that an effort is being made to audit those who send young people to colleges.  A place in a third level institution is not the be-all and end-all of life.

Senator Fitzgerald spoke on that subject.  School should produce rounded people who can mix with others and all abilities should be catered for.Senator Bannon asked about Leas Cross and VAT on charities.  He attended the annual general meeting of the Longford Association for the Mentally Handicapped, for which I commend him.  He said the charity had paid €157,000 in VAT.  There are constant requests to reduce VAT and every case put forward is a good one.  However, I take his point and if the Minister comes before the House, the Senator can make it to him.The Senator also asked for a debate on the Barr report, which is another we are trying to arrange.  We have a wish list but it is a matter of people being free to come to the House.  However, the Senator is right because it is a fine report and should be debated in one of the Houses.  I have not neglected it and it is one of the ones we try to arrange each week.I agree with Senator Fitzgerald's point about real education.  Senator Browne asked for a debate on accident and emergency services.  He is taking part in the fun run in the tunnel.  If he gives me a card I will sign it, if it is for a charity.

#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House.  Since our previous debate on this issue, we have already seen substantial change in the area of child protection.  Not alone do we have a committee on child protection, of which the Minister of State and I are members, the Taoiseach has announced we will have a referendum in the spring to protect the rights of the child.  The Minister of State is currently engaging in talks with all parties on the issue and he will, no doubt, have all-party support for it.  The talks involve seeking a wording that will be agreeable to all parties.  The referendum is a good news story and I am sure we will get agreement on the wording.With regard to the rights of the child, I was interested to hear the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of baby Ann.  I heard somebody mention on a radio show that both sets of parents had been legally represented, but that nobody legally represented the right of the little two year old girl.  Initially I thought the judge would be responsible for protecting her rights, but realised that constitutionally he might not be in a position to do that.  Has the Minister of State an opinion on whether she should have been legally represented or whether the court should have appointed someone to represent her?When the Minister of State was in Geneva, I was gratified to see  the UN Committee was pleased with Ireland's signing up to the different recommendations it laid down.  We have come a long way in the past 14 years.  We have an Ombudsman for Children, a National Children's Office, a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Dáil na nÓg, about which I spoke briefly on our previous discussion.  I know something about Dáil na nÓg because both my daughters were very involved with it.Ireland was not without problems or concerns with regard to child protection.  However, compared with other countries we were far more advanced with regard to child safety.  We have all read from time to time about places like Thailand where there is sex trafficking of teenagers.  Sadly, I have heard that young men, including young Irish men, are frequent visitors to Thailand.The issue of child labour is another concern.  A mother in Dublin may pay €140 for a pair of football boots, but the poor child who has practically blinded himself or herself at the sewing machine making the boots only gets approximately €2 for a day's work.I also want to mention the UN Committee's concerns about immigration and communities that continue to practise female genital mutilation.  At the weekend we heard the Supreme Court has come back with its judgment on the case going through the court and that it has granted the mother the right to appeal.  The issue is topical.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Before going further, I wish to acknowledge the work he is doing in this area.  We cannot doubt his commitment as progress in the area of children's rights and affairs has been significantly advanced.  As the Labour Party spokesperson on this area, I acknowledge his work in this significant area that covers matters ranging from the provision of child care to the area of children's justice.The Minister of State has now been landed with the issue of the constitutional referendum.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I have not got the Minister of State's wisdom or his legal background.  There has been significant progress in this area.  The Government has taken on the issue of child care, although not to the extent I would like.  One area missing attention is preschool education.  Will the Minister of State consider the failure of the Government to take on the possibility of providing a pre-school place for every child, not only from an economic point of view, although that is important, but also in terms of what it would make available to all our children?  I would have no difficulty, for example, with rolling out the scheme in a way that would ensure disadvantaged areas were the first to benefit.  It would make a great difference to families in disadvantaged areas if their children could access good quality pre-school education because education allows us to begin levelling the playing field.  By tackling child poverty and offering children equal opportunities to participate, we will give our youth the chance to reach their potential as participating members of the community.  However, commitment and investment will be needed if we are to succeed.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment in that regard but I wonder why the Government has not addressed the issue because, while private provision is generally good, it cannot replace a system in which every three year-old child can expect automatic access to pre-school education, regardless of his or her family circumstances.Significant progress has been made on child care with the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children and the Ombudsman for Children.  However, the range of the ombudsman's powers remains limited.  The exclusion of children in detention or prison from the ombudsman's remit is a serious shortcoming because the children concerned are vulnerable and need representation and support.  As the Minister for State's boss once famously said, it s a case of a lot done but more to do.The report by the UN committee highlights the misses — I will not use the word "failures" because that may be too harsh — in the Government's approach to children.  The committee criticised the revised age of criminal responsibility, which provides that children as young as ten years of age may be found guilty of serious criminal offences, from the perspective of the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.Many of the provisions of the Children Act 2001, including alternatives to detention for children through community and other sanctions, have yet to be implemented.  We need to consider the unimplemented provisions in the Act on child justice in the context of the apparent increase in anti-social behaviour by relatively young children.  I am sure the Minister of State is currently knocking on doors, as are I and all the other Members who wish to serve in the Dáil after the next general election.  It is a feature of many estates, and local authority estates in particular, that people feel terrorised by gangs of children.  Hallowe'en was a nightmare for a lot of people, although the fact that children were off school for a week puts the matter in context.  I am referring not only to older people here, because I met three single mothers living in the same estate who told me that a brother of one of the women had to rescue them on Hallowe'en night from the intimidatory actions being perpetrated outside their front doors by 12 to 14 year old children.  Given the considerable efforts that went into the Children Act and the fact that several excellent provisions contained in the Act remain to be implemented, it is time to reconsider the issues.The UN committee expressed concern at the plans to introduce biometric identity cards for children under new immigration legislation.  While I will not dwell on that matter, I wish to raise the issue of accommodation and care of unaccompanied minors who seek asylum.  Concerns have been expressed to me by people who work in this area that the hostel accommodation being provided is inappropriate.An issue which emerged during the summer was that a shortage of appropriate places resulted in children who were in care and about to attend court hearings being accommodated in hotels or bed and breakfasts and looked after by social workers or other HSE employees who worked in institutions during the day and stayed with the children during the evening.  This situation was reported to be prevalent in the midlands, although not in my area.  The Minister of State is looking at me with scepticism.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I do not consider such arrangements to be acceptable.  One could argue that care is being given to the children but the setting is not appropriate.  The issue was brought to my attention during the summer recess, and I did not raise it in the House before today.  My investigations have confirmed the truth of the matter, although I could not make an estimate of the numbers involved.  I am aware that difficulties have arisen in terms of developing the necessary resources for providing children with appropriate accommodation but the situation I have outlined falls far short of acceptable standards.  I urge the Minister of State to investigate the matter.I have asked the Leader for a debate on the issues raised by the baby Ann case.  I welcome the fact that we are beginning to debate the position of children within the community.  It was not long ago that the idea of giving children independent rights was inconceivable.  We have moved a long way in that regard.  The campaigns by Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance and other organisations to put this issue on the agenda is bearing fruit from their point of view.  That the Taoiseach has responded to calls for a referendum on including children's rights in the Constitution is an indication of the elevated level it has reached politically and in terms of it becoming a reality following a referendum.There are many issues to be considered and I welcome the Government's inclusive approach.  I am aware the non-governmental organisations have been asked, under the umbrella of the Children's Rights Alliance, to convene with the Minister of State to discuss possible wordings, the implications of those and so on.  I hope we will have a third discussion at Oireachtas level.  I have called for a debate in this House well in advance of the publication of a wording to allow us to tease out the issue, which is not simple.  I am not a constitutional lawyer but I know from reading the summary of the judgments in the so-called baby Ann case that there are complex issues to be considered and that a balance of rights must be achieved.  We have had difficulty in achieving a balance of rights in the past involving children who were unborn.  I hope we will be able to agree on a position which not only achieves what we want but does not cause us further problems.As a society and a community we have embraced the notion of children having rights independently.  Senator Feeney asked a question, to which I also want to hear the answer, about separate representation for a child in a Supreme Court case such as the one that was heard this week.  My assumption is that child could not have been represented because it was not possible legally, but cases other than Supreme Court cases are heard daily in which children need representation.  I am aware they get representation in many cases, but I ask the Minister to clarify that aspect.I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House for what is a valuable debate.  I thank the Leader also for providing time for the debate.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome also the opportunity to debate this issue.  The Minister of State has been positive in coming to the House on a number of occasions as he has today for this resumed debate.The issue of pre-school care to which Senator O'Meara referred is important.  I am very interested in some of the developments in that area.  I have long advocated the use of our schools as centres for pre-school and after school care.  That is beginning to happen in many small and large towns throughout the country.  The good news is that there now appears to be space in our primary schools that was not always available.  Once the space is available, it does not take too much money to provide staffing compared with the very large grants the Minister is providing for new child care centres.I could give the Minister examples of devolved grants being used very effectively to provide rooms to be used for child care.  The Minister recently announced funding of €1.4 million for a major child centre project in Kinvara.  That is the largest investment the town will ever see, but an additional €40,000 was provided for staffing in the local primary school, which is welcome because it can be used immediately and we do not have to wait for those buildings to be erected.There is a major cost involved in this area and I could name many towns that have benefited from this investment.  The standard figure appears to be between €1 million and €1.4 million.  I refer to towns like Mountbellew, Tuam and others towns in Galway that have benefited greatly from that funding.  In addition to the fact that child care is costly, the sad reality is that parents must sometimes travel long distances to work because of the housing difficulty.  The first priority for them, therefore, is child care because of that need to travel.Another welcome development is the number of child care committees now established.  I understand there are 33 local city and county child care committees, which have done very good work.  They have also recommended many of the projects the Minister of State is promoting and will support.Issues the Government has tackled in recent years have been important.  Maternity leave, for example, is important.  I understand an additional four weeks was provided last March and that an additional four weeks will be provided from next March.  Child benefit has been increased.  The early child care supplement of €1,000 for children less than six years is also welcome.Another welcome measure was the tax relief for child minders who could care for up to three children in their home, but I understand no tax is paid if the amount earned is less than €10,000 per annum.  I hope that will be examined in next month's budget because I made inquiries about cost in a number of child care centres in County Galway and the standard figure is approximately €160 per week for full child care.  That could amount of €24,000 per year for three children and therefore an increase in the threshold would be welcome.The question Senator O'Meara raised about schools being closed for Hallowe'en is important.  There is always a danger that accidents will occur involving young people or those living in fear of the damage fireworks can do.  It is important to have fireworks for community celebrations but it amazes me the way people can gather all those materials months before Hallowe'en.  I do not know where they get them but they must do a great deal of research and put a great deal of time into it.That brings me to the question of playground facilities, in which I hope we will see an improvement throughout the country.  There has been talk for years about insurance not being available for playgrounds.  Galway County Council came up with its own scheme which meant it could get an insurance policy.  The five electoral areas will have three new playgrounds this year, which is 15 in total for the county.  That is a very good start.When we consider the development of towns, new roads and where land becomes available, everybody says we must have housing in a certain location and land for industry, but the last consideration is a playground, recreation area or a park where young and old can play.  It is important for young people in particular that they would be able to avail of those facilities.An area I want to stress in particular is the question of services for children with disabilities.  I met the service providers, such as the Brothers of Charity, and the Galway County Association, who are happy that they are making good progress on their services, but they make the point, and the Minister might agree with it, that despite all the resources available for even one child, from where will the funding come for other children?  At this stage we should engage in forward planning and have definite budgets, whether for a three or five-year period.  When Senator Leyden and I were members of the health board, one of the issues we continually advocated was to have these schemes continued.On the question of residential places, I understood we had a sufficient number but from talking to the people in the Brothers of Charity and the Galway Association, that appears not to be the case.  That is an important area.I very much welcome the Taoiseach's statement about a referendum on children's rights.  That is important and the Minister of State has been very supportive of it.  The issues he raised are difficult ones.  People have told me that the bond between parents and children is important, whether it is a prospective adoptive family or whatever.  I agree it is important but one sometimes wonders why decisions are not taken more quickly.Senator O'Meara referred to the balance of rights and asked whether we would ever achieve it.  Difficulties arise between the birth mother and the prospective adoptive mother, or adoptive parents, and it is therefore very important that a balance be struck.In my travels I have spoken to elderly people.  Grandparents must be very careful and should never tell their sons and daughters how to rear their children, bearing in mind that they might have a different view on child rearing.  Children were reared differently in the grandparents' time.  Some of their practices may have been good and others may not.  This is a very difficult issue and I hope there will be a good outcome.  However, it means we will need to have much discussion on the rights of children, who are the most important people.  The rights of children comprise an important consideration in striking the right balance.

The Minister of State is eminently qualified to do so and has performed extremely well in this regard.  I thank him for all the work he has done on children's rights and affairs.  I met him in various locations around the country and noted that he takes his job very seriously and has championed the provision of child care facilities.Some of the UN committee's criticisms are a little over the top.  Approximately 17 criticisms have been highlighted and I will refer to two, one of which is the lack of child care facilities.  Much work has been done in this regard over the years and we could not debate this issue without recognising it.  However, there is a need for many more pre-school places.  Such places give children a proper start in life, especially in disadvantaged communities.Grind schools and fee-paying schools have become part of the education system.  In my area Boyle2000.com provides computer training in the form of European computer driving licence courses to every child of national school age.  This has enhanced the children’s computer skills and has given them confidence.  The advantaged or well-off are usually the only ones who can afford such courses.  The course in question has been a great success.  It has been allocated funding and could be allocated much more.  It is a pilot scheme carried out in conjunction with various community groups and it has worked.  It costs €3 or €4 per week but if a family cannot afford it, it is not charged, thus allowing all children to participate.  The model is worth considering.  Much pre-school and child care provision is of good quality but a little more can be done in this regard.We need to be vigilant about the increase in the number of racist crimes.  Ireland was traditionally very inward-looking and was not used to immigration.  It presents a great challenge but I would like to believe we have met it quite well.  This does not take from the fact that there are pockets of people who are plainly racist.  We must adopt measures on the ground to address this.  One or two schools in my constituency have expelled young students for hurling racist abuse at visitors.  In the towns in question, the Garda has taken the problem on board but it seems to have no resources or detention places for the offenders.  It is unnerving to note that the offenders, who may be 15 or 16 years of age, are probably misguided and out of control.  Their parents probably do not have the proper skills or confidence to take them on.  The youths in question are engaged in bullying outside the school environment.I am concerned that this problem is becoming prevalent throughout the country.  The offenders are more than likely male but some are female.  When one is 15 years of age and running wild, one has no responsibilities.  This must be dealt with.  The Garda, parents and teachers are trying to tackle the problem but there do not seem to be enough detention places or other mechanisms of redress.  We need to explore solutions to stamp out racist offences and bullying.Many resources and much time are being devoted to addressing the poor health status of Traveller children.  I was travelling from Sligo some days ago and admired all the new houses and housing estates.  Most of the new houses are quite well insulated and have all the modern conveniences, including hot running water, showers and televisions.  When one goes by Travellers' caravans on a wet day, one says to oneself that one would not be able to live in such conditions, which have a bearing on the poor health status of Traveller children.  We all believe more must and can be done to address this.The lack of progress in banning the smacking of children was raised.  We are losing control of ourselves in this regard.  When I was a certain age, a good smack sometimes did me no harm.

Where does the discipline process end?  If we are not disciplined and do not fear stepping over the mark, we can run wild.  Many years ago, if a child left his street or town, somebody always recognised him and informed his parents.  One always knew one's parents had a good cane.  Mine not only smacked me but smacked my friend also.  I would not say smacking children is desirable but the criticism that there is a lack of progress in banning the smacking of children is a little over the top.Issues arise regarding child poverty, particularly among children of lone parents.  There are many incentives in place and community welfare officers have much discretion in this regard.  It is worrying that child poverty in lone parent families seems to be unbalanced.  If I can make criticisms in certain respects, I cannot criticise the Minister of State's application to his job.  I wish him every success.  When one is in Opposition, it is nice to be able to acknowledge what has been done by the Government in this area.  I wish the Minister of State continued success.

I commend him on his work as Minister of State with responsibility for children.  The establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children was a wonderful decision by the Government and, in particular, by the Taoiseach.  The choice of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as the person with responsibility in this regard was a worthy one.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	152	We will have to wait until next May or June.  It may be before that.  As the Minister of State attends Cabinet meetings, he is fully aware of all the issues pertaining to children.I do not normally follow Senator Feighan in the House.  I commend him on his views on equality of opportunity for Travellers and Traveller families.  Those of us involved with Roscommon County Council have tried our best in that respect.  It is not the easiest or most politically advantageous issue to raise at any time.  We have made some contribution.  Traveller children can be educated if they are in fixed abodes.  We should commend our schools which have openly and willingly assisted settled Traveller families that are part of the community in the education sector.When Traveller children reach a certain age, there is a tendency for their families to follow the old-style tradition of withdrawing them from secondary schools.  It is a difficulty that is hard to explain.  Such children must continue their education and get to third level, if possible.  They have the ability, but they sometimes suffer when decisions are made by families not to allow children, especially girls, to continue in the education system.  Some Travellers might not want their children to be exposed to the settled community.I disagree with Senator Feighan's comments on corporal punishment, which I oppose in the home and in schools because I do not think it has contributed anything.  We all remember the fear we had when we attended school.  I walked a mile and a half to school.  It was not a pleasant experience to get six of the best or whatever it might have been.  It did not happen to me very often, but it happened to me as it happened to every other child.  The best teachers I ever had were Sister Anthony, who taught me in the Convent of Mercy in Roscommon and never slapped a child in her life, and Brother Paul O'Dwyer, who died last year and was in charge of the Christian Brothers school in Roscommon.  While the Christian Brothers have been much maligned, I had nothing but good experiences of them in Roscommon.It is difficult to make corporal punishment in the home illegal.  We do not want to go down that road because it would not be possible to enforce it.  Most families use corporal punishment as a last resort in any situation.  It rarely occurs, as far as possible, but I presume it arises from time to time.  All we can do is give the example of our own lives and the way we raise our children.  As I have said many times, one becomes somewhat experienced when one has the blessing and fortune of having a family, but one then becomes redundant, which is a strange thing.  Grandparents can have a great influence in the area of education.I would like to comment on the Minister of State's work in the context of this debate on the UN committee's highly commendable report on the progress that has been made on the position of children in Ireland.  I am sure the Government is delighted that the UN has produced a report that gives Ireland some very good marks.  The Minister of State recently spent a hectic day visiting some of the extraordinary number of quality child care facilities in County Roscommon.  He met the parish priest of Fourmilehouse, Rev. Fr. Raymond Browne, who is dynamic in bringing services to that area.  He also met Bernie Kearney and others who have helped to develop an impressive state-of-the-art child care centre adjoining the school, community centre, housing for the elderly and church in Fourmilehouse.I was delighted that the Minister of State attended.  He also went to the Lisnamult area of County Roscommon, where child care facilities have been provided for some time.  I am sure he will not be found wanting when the authorities from that area contact him seeking assistance with a major development of that facility.  I had the honour of serving with the Minister of State's father, the late Brian Lenihan, whom I succeeded as TD for Roscommon.The Minister of State called to the well-designed state-of-the-art facility in Frenchpark, which was opened by the President.  The Taoiseach was there last Friday.  There are similar facilities in Loughglynn.  The Minister of State also met the group from Tulsk and Cams that is proposing two projects in the area.  Since he met the group in question, both projects have been approved by the Government.  I am pleased to put such positive developments on the record.Just as we were under pressure to provide national schools when I was a Deputy, it seems we are now under pressure to provide child care facilities in every town and village.  If that is what is required, we will have to provide those facilities.  The Minister of State dug the foundation stone and approved the money for a beautiful new centre in Croghan.  He also received proposals for a child care facility as part of the youth centre at Circular Road in Roscommon.  He will appreciate that representations have been made to him by certain councillors in that area.  The worthwhile development in question will be based on a site donated by the State.I ask the Government to consider in the forthcoming budget the proposal that child care facilities be exempt from rates.  The proposal, which was made by Mr. Séamus Butler, who is a member of Longford County Council, has been approved unanimously by that council.  It makes sense because the State ultimately must pick up the tab for various overheads of this nature.  It is a form of cross-subsidisation.  I agree that child care facilities offered by the private and public sectors, communities and co-operatives should be exempt from rates.  Rates should not be imposed in such circumstances.  I commend Councillor Butler and I ask all local authorities to follow his lead.  The motion has been passed by Longford County Council.  I ask my friends in Roscommon County Council to agree to this proposal at their next meeting.  It would be worthwhile to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve the plan.I echo the words of Professor Lucy Smith, who is the United Nations representative in this area, in the report being considered by the House.  She said it is impressive that so much has been achieved in Ireland in respect of children's rights in such a short period.  That is a major statement by the UN.  It is right to acknowledge that we have come such a long way.  The Office of the Minister for Children was established in the 2006 budget, which also provided for the new early child care supplement and the national strategy for children, which will run from 2006 to 2010.The Minister of State recently met young people yet again at the highest level of democracy.  He has given young people throughout the country a voice in Government by allowing them to express their views to him, to be conveyed in turn to the Government.  The Minister of State does not just express his views and those of other mature politicians, but also those of young people who outlined their views to him in an open manner.  I listened to the Minister of State when he spoke on television about this matter which received tremendous coverage.The drafting of the new child protection regulations has commenced.  The level of investment in education is unprecedented, as I have already said in the context of my home county.  The Government made the wise decision to approve the appointment of the first Ombudsman for Children, who has been appointed by the President in accordance with usual procedure.An expert on the UN committee highlighted that social expenditure on children in Ireland has doubled since 1997.  This huge increase underlines the Government's commitment to children.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has said, we are working hard to ensure that our economic success leads to positive social change.  That is most important in the area of the rights of children.  I welcome the announcement that the Minister of State is engaged in an article-by-article examination of the Constitution to ensure it is child-proofed.  A referendum on this subject would be a landmark in the history of the State.  While we should not rush such a poll, it should be provided for in the lifetime of this Government or early in the next Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Labour Party Administration.

The Judiciary had no choice in this matter.  The only consolation is that baby Ann is loved very much and we cannot say that for many children around the world, especially those in Africa who have nobody to love and care for them.  That is not much consolation in this case in which there are two sets of parents with two sets of demands and requirements.  We can only hope that baby Ann will grow up with love from both sets of parents, who are excellent people.  I hope they can work together to ensure she has a bright future.  We should cherish all our children equally.  The constitutional amendment proposed by the Minister of State and approved in principle by the Taoiseach is the right direction in which to go.  We can devote our efforts to encourage other states in the EU to follow the lead given by this Minister of State with responsibility for children.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this.  I welcome the Minister of State and I am very pleased that he is handling this issue.  He has grabbed a hold of his portfolio and has shown his interest in the topic.  I also wish to start by applauding the process under discussion.  It is right that when we sign up to an international convention, we should be held accountable before the international community for how well we perform in bringing that convention into effect.  It is good that we should have to go before the UN committee every few years and account for what we have done.  I am not sure if we have done this too often in the past.As the UN report makes clear, we have made some progress in a number of areas but there are many remaining where our performance has been below par.  The purpose of a debate such as this is to bring such matters into the public domain, not only to create awareness but also a groundswell of support for future action.  I wish to focus my contribution on one of the areas in which the UN finds us lacking.  This is the matter of denominational education, which is raised on page 14, paragraphs 60 and 61.  The committee reiterates its concern that non-denominational or multi-denominational schools represent less than 1% of the number of primary education facilities in Ireland.  The committee encourages us:[T]o take fully into consideration the recommendations made by the Committee on Racial Discrimination which encourages the establishment of non-denominational or multi-denominational schools and to amend the existing legislative framework to eliminate discrimination in school admissions.This is not the first time the committee has drawn attention to this issue, but we have done nothing about it.  Two UN committees have found us wanting in this area, but so far we have not responded meaningfully to their prodding.History has left us with a structure for our educational system that is quite inappropriate for the age in which we live.  When the British created our national school system in the 1830s, Ireland was sharply divided into two religious communities and it made some sort of sense to mirror that division in the way education was organised.  The result was that the management of schools was effectively handed over to the two main churches, each of which provided denominational education for its own flock.  They did a marvellous job and we have been fortunate in Ireland with the education provided to us by nuns, priests and the Christian Brothers.I was in South America recently and I discovered that a couple of generations ago, legislators in both Uruguay and Argentina went looking for an education system that would suit their people.  They found what they were looking for in Ireland and they encouraged the Christian Brothers to set up an education system in their countries.The denominational system may have been the right solution for the 19th century, but I doubt if it is the right way to structure our education almost 200 years later.  Over the past 40 years, we have seen significant growth in the number of parents who prefer their children to be educated in a non-denominational or multi-denominational environment.  The recent wave of immigration has brought to our schools many children who belong to neither of the two denominations that until recently dominated our culture.Let me make it quite clear that I am not against people sending their children to denominational schools, which are for the most part excellent.  I do not for a moment suggest that the State should not support denominational schools to the generous extent that it does today.  I object to a structure for our education that does not offer to everyone as a right the choice of a non-denominational or multi-denominational approach.  We do not offer such a choice to everyone, still less do we offer it as a right. In today's world, it is wrong for us not to do so.  I agree with the two UN committees in this regard and I say this as a committed member of one of the two main churches.  I am a supporter of denominational education if one wants it, but I know that there are a considerable number of people who do not want such an education nowadays.  I am not sure if we have taken the correct steps to enable that to happen.My belief about this is strengthened when we consider the matter in an all-Ireland context.  Nobody would deny that the basic problem underlying the situation in Northern Ireland is the mutual antagonism of the two communities.  Many would argue that no lasting reconciliation between the communities can take place until they abandon the virtual apartheid that keeps them apart and start treating each other as the neighbours that they are.  I know the North very well and I know that the education system causes divisions.  If one meets somebody and wants to know what side that person is on, he or she just has to talk about his or her school.  A main pillar of the apartheid that continues to divide Northern Ireland is the sectarian nature of the education system. Like our own system in the Republic, it is strictly segregated on religious lines.  Despite the great success of the few multi-denominational schools that exist, very little progress has been made in loosening the sectarian stranglehold on education that many would argue is one of the fundamental causes of the divisions.In both North and South, the churches have united in their wish to continue the denominational system.  It is high time that we questioned that outright opposition in the light of the circumstances we live in today.  In this part of the country, given the calmer circumstances that prevail, we are in an excellent position to lead the way in this very sensitive area.  I hope this issue will not get overlooked among the many other matters the UN committee has raised in its uncompromising report.  For the sake of future peace on this island, it is one of the most important and urgent issues to emerge.I am pleased that the Minister of State has brought this matter before the House.  It is worth debating and I would like the focus to be placed on that particular topic.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	156	While I am in favour of choice in education, including multi-denominational education, we should not lose sight of the fact that there is much de facto multi-denominationalism.  My nephew and nieces have been educated without exception in Catholic schools, yet they are still members of the Church of Ireland.  I am a member of a board of management of a school which is under Church of Ireland management but which has a 70% Catholic intake.  Therefore, I do not think one should paint the system in the South as more rigid than elsewhere.  It may have been that way 30 or 40 years ago, but that is not the case today.I do not normally speak in these debates because it is not possible to follow every policy field with close attention.  However, I warmly congratulate the Minister of State with responsibility for children on the pioneering work he has been doing.  Tackling child poverty and disadvantage through the health, education and social welfare systems is obviously a high priority.  There has been tremendous growth in excellent child care facilities in villages, towns and cities all over the country, and I am sure the good work will be continued.  Consideration should be given to the problems of obesity and higher priority accorded to providing sports halls and facilities in schools, particularly at primary level.  Referring to a previous debating point, it is good that corporal punishment should be discouraged, even in the home.  Whether it is practical to penalise it, except in clearly defined and extreme circumstances, is another matter.I welcome the idea of a constitutional amendment, although, having being involved in some others, I do not underestimate the complex task of finding the right formulation.  However, it is right that children should be recognised as autonomous human beings rather than simply being subsumed into the family.  When the Constitution was written, people across the board had much more authoritarian ideas, and the role of parents, Church and State was taken for granted.  There was no question of children's rights differing in any way from those of their elders and, as they would have said in those days, betters.It would be a good idea in many instances to have children represented separately.  I do not know whether it would be practical or popular, but I believe it should apply not least in separation and divorce cases.  I know judges take account of children's interests, but if there were constitutional backing, it might become a more central factor.  The creation of an Ombudsman for Children is a very important step towards recognition of their autonomous rights.Incidentally, in another judgment, the Supreme Court has reprimanded the State regarding the separation of children from immigrant parents.  It is fitting that the rights of children would not be subjected to the exigencies of immigration policy, and we will have to rethink the matter.  That is the advantage of having a written Constitution and a Supreme Court.Two other matters relate to anti-social behaviour.  There has been a development in towns throughout the country of housing liaison officers becoming involved in order that the problem is not dealt with in a purely criminal or legal context but in a holistic social fashion.  Many measures not directly connected with the law can improve the situation.  Another idea from across the water that the Minister might consider, which I found both intriguing and amusing, is sending difficult children to the best boarding schools instead of placing them in detention, the reasoning being that their fees are still considerably less than the cost of a State place of detention.  Perhaps that might be explored with the boarding sector.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I thank Senators for their informative and useful statements.It was very generously acknowledged on all sides of the House that Ireland has come a long way in the past ten years in implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and that progress was endorsed by the UN committee that examined our record thereon.  There is no doubt the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children gives renewed focus to issues relating to children within public administration.  Equally, the appointment of a Minister of State regularly attending Government meetings ensures that, as never before, children's interests are taken into account before it arrives at decisions.The Taoiseach's recent announcement on behalf of the Government of its intention to hold a referendum on children's rights to accord them a central place in the Constitution is an important development regarding their status.  The status of the child as a rights holder was highlighted by the UN committee as a concern in its concluding remarks.  I have been charged with the responsibility of initiating a process of consultation and discussion with the other Dáil parties and all other relevant groups over coming weeks.  That process aims to achieve consensus on the wording of an appropriate amendment regarding the place of children in the Constitution.  It is the Government's intention to find a wording that reflects the Irish people's desire to establish robust safeguards for the rights and liberties of all children and enshrine the highest possible standards of protection.The Supreme Court's judgment this week brings into focus the Taoiseach's wisdom in proposing a referendum.  That the case took 19 days of argument in the High Court and an appeal to the Supreme Court demonstrates the complexity of the issues.  The Supreme Court judges have delivered separate judgments outlining their view of the law applicable to the dispute, and each requires very careful consideration.  I have examined the implications of all such judgments for the proposed referendum.  It may be that they have implications for the content and wording of any constitutional change, and judgments may also have implications for legislative change in our adoption code.  The exchange between the committee and the delegation can be seen as useful and constructive, and I know the Government will take into account the concluding observations in developing children's policy.In the very short time left it will not be possible to comment on the complete list of issues raised by Senators, but I will deal with several.  Senator Browne raised the issue of access to psychological services for children.  The current position is that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments, either through the National Educational Psychological Service or through the scheme that it administers for commissioning psychological assessments.  Schools that do not currently have psychologists assigned by NEPS can avail themselves of the scheme, whereby schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of a panel of private psychologists approved by the service, with fees paid directly.Senator Brian Hayes asked that I reply on the assessment of children in care and the procedure for returning children to their families.  Under the Child Care Act 1991, the HSE has statutory responsibility in the area.  The dominant focus has been on the protection and care of children at risk, but we have shifted to a more preventative approach.  It should be noted that 90% of children in care are in foster care placements.  A designated social worker is allocated to children as soon as the need for admission to care is identified and for as long as they remain in care.  Social workers co-ordinate care arrangements and have responsibility for ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and standards, including an assessment of the young person's needs, care planning and review, including consultations with the young person, families, foster carers and other significant parties.Regarding care planning for children in foster care, the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995 set out the legal requirement for the development of a care plan.  That must be reviewed every six months for the first two years and thereafter annually.  The regulations also set out some of the areas that must be considered by the assigned social worker in reviewing the care plan, including whether the child's circumstances have changed and whether it would be in the child's best interests to return to the custody of his or her parents.Senator Henry raised several issues regarding mental health, including the Mental Health Act 2001, which entered force on 1 November 2006.  The Act provides additional safeguards for the protection of the very small number of children requiring involuntary detention owing to mental illness.  From now on, all applications for the involuntary detention of a child must be made by the HSE to the District Court.  The HSE has put in place interim arrangements for the treatment of children in adult units pending the provision of the dedicated child and adolescent beds. As Senator Henry is aware, the Government adopted the report presented to it earlier this year in this regard.  All children admitted to adult units will be treated on a one-to-one basis by appropriately trained staff.  The Mental Health Commission has also issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001.  In recent years the HSE has made significant progress in the provision of additional child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists to support the work of community-based child and adolescent multidisciplinary mental health teams.  There are now 70 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists employed by the HSE.  Having said that, I take Senator Henry's point that progress must be made in respect of this area.The National Office for Suicide Prevention, which is responsible for the implementation of the national strategy or action on suicide prevention, supports a number of initiatives to promote the mental health of children and to prevent suicide.  These include programmes in schools, projects in youth organisations and related services, and the provision of information for young persons on dedicated websites.I thank Senator O'Meara for the good wishes she extended to me as Minister of State with responsibility for children.  The Senator referred to pre-school education.  I agree it would be a desirable objective to ensure every child in the country should obtain such education.  I was pleased to hear the Senator state that she would like to see those disadvantaged areas and other areas that are not availing of pre-school education to obtain access to it first.  The latter is extremely important.  I commend the Senator because in the lead-up to a general election, it would be easy for any political party to state it would like to ensure that every child should have access to a guaranteed free year of pre-school education.  It must be acknowledged that a large number of children are already obtaining pre-school education thanks to the efforts and contributions made by their parents.  It is vital to ensure that, in the first instance, those who do not have access to such education should obtain it.  That is the important first step because it will lead us close to the position where all children will have access to a pre-school year of education.  The wealth of evidence that the latter does so much good in the context of the later development of children is overwhelming.The Senator raised a number of other points.  She referred to the detention of children in prisons, which is extremely unusual.  The Government has accepted my proposal that the use of St. Patrick's Institution will be phased out.  Under the new Children Act, child detention schools will become the model for all offenders under the age of 18.  The necessary commitments have been made, in financial and planning terms, by the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science and work on this project is well under way.The age of criminal responsibility was discussed when the House debated the amendments to what has become the Children Act.  I disagreed with the United Nations on this matter in Geneva.  I was not prepared to take responsibility for stating that a ten or 11 year old could never commit a homicide or an aggravated sexual crime.  I disagreed with the UN because I was obliged to take responsibility for commencing the legislation.  It is easy for committees to indicate what is desirable, but they are not obliged to face victims and state that offences never occurred.  That is the obverse of what the UN recommends.  However, I accept that the latter must consider matters exclusively from the perspective of the child and criticise us on that basis.Senator Leyden referred to the considerable progress that has been made in the provision of community child care facilities.  There is no doubt a substantial investment has been made in that regard.  The Senator correctly indicated that child care facilities are increasingly replacing national schools as the focus of interest for many local representatives.  We have renewed the child care investment programme for a further five years in order that we can continue to roll out investment in this area.Senator Quinn raised the question of denominational education.  This matter did not feature very strongly at the hearing in Geneva.  The committee was impressed by the achievement and performance levels of our school sector and by the levels of attainment that Irish students, in the context of international standards, achieve.  However, the Senator made his case on an entirely different basis and stated that, as is the case under the Constitution, parents have the right to determine how their children are to be educated.  The Education Act recognises a variety of patrons.  I accept, however, that because Educate Together is the most recent patron, it has more temporary schools than other patrons that already have ownership of lands and established buildings, not that they are always satisfied with the condition of the latter.  Educate Together has a difficulty in that it possesses a large number of temporary schools.  The Government has increased the amount being invested in the schools building programme.  There is no doubt we must try to give increased priority to the completion of Educate Together schools.Senator Quinn referred to a number of phenomena in respect of multi-denominational and non-denominational education.  The Senator spoke about the massive growth in the numbers seeking non-denominational education and the recent waves of immigrants.  It would be dangerous to assume recent immigrants to this country necessarily want non-denominational education for their children.  My experience, as a representative of the constituency which probably has the largest proportion of immigrants in the country, is to the contrary.  I have discovered that many immigrants want religious education in schools because they tend to use their religion as an identifier in their country of arrival.  I will, however, draw the Senator's observations to the attention of the Minister.There is a great deal of wisdom in what Senator Mansergh stated, namely, that we must give consideration to schools exercising greater flexibility in this area.  There are a large number of Catholic schools in Dublin in which are enrolled large numbers of immigrant students who profess different religious faiths.  Arrangements will have to be devised for these children.  I am aware that some within the Catholic Church have acknowledged that.  A degree of flexibility will have to be developed in the system in respect of the different conscientious preferences of parents and for their proper accommodation.Senator Feeney referred to pre-school education and the need for play facilities.  Along with Senator Mansergh and several other Members, she also referred to the separate representation of children in the courts.  I am giving further consideration to this matter in the context of the legislation relating to children and the guardianship ad litem issue.  I am somewhat dissatisfied that while we provided in the Child Care Act for a guardian ad litem to be appointed to a child, we have never defined what should be the function and scope of this service.  It is important that it should be regulated and that there should be a clear set of standards.

That may well be my fault because I may have omitted to contact the Senator.  However, I took for granted that she would support a motion of this nature.  The absence of her name is not in any way to be taken as a matter of significance and resulted from an omission on my part.There is a history to my moving this motion.  In May 1984, I moved Second Stage of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill.  It caused enormous trouble for the Government at the time because those in the Labour Party, who subsequently became my colleagues but who were then in Government, refused to support the Government which wanted to vote down the Bill.  My good friend and one who is, I am glad to say, in the whole of his health, former Senator Jack Harte, was the Whip at that time.  He assured me in his inimitable Dublin accent there was no way he would whip the Labour Party to vote against a Bill to support the homeless.I deliberately chose the language in this motion to try to create a consensus.  Whatever about my party affiliations, throughout my career I have tried to deal with issues — the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, can confirm this — such as the care of the mentally ill and those concerning specific aspects of disability, however naive that may appear to the hard men and women of Fianna Fáil — they are not all hard but the ultimate core is very hard.  I would prefer to be in politics to try to make progress on these issues rather than simply to launch into a wonderful rhetorical flourish about the heartlessness of the Government, as I am more than capable of doing.The motion is inspired by the MakeRoom campaign, which was developed by Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold.  That campaign is based on and grows from the progress that has been achieved.  I am more than happy to accept progress has been achieved, given the evidence in Dublin and Cork that the number of people sleeping on the streets is not growing and may be stabilising or declining, which is no small achievement.The fact it is 22 years since I first raised the issue in the House is no great compliment to a succession of Governments, including some of which my party was a member.  However, although we are again discussing homelessness, any feelings of déjà vu are not appropriate.  When we dealt with the issue more than 20 years ago, we first had to convince a sceptical State, including the local authorities, that there was a problem.  The view then was that the only people who were homeless were those who chose to be homeless or who were not housable.  We have moved on from that position and we no longer hear that argument.When we made progress in that regard, the next problem was to sort out who was responsible for dealing with homelessness.  The litany of buck-passing between Government, health boards and local authorities was one of my most significant political educations.  We got beyond that phase and we now know who is responsible.  Local authorities are the lead service providers in dealing with homelessness, although they are not and should not be the only service providers.  It took blood, sweat and tears to achieve that but it has been achieved.We have made progress and I will not pretend otherwise.  Nevertheless, the people sleeping on the streets were an affront to us.  They are still there.  One can go out the front gate of Leinster House at 11 p.m. any night of the week, turn right, go less than 100 metres, look right into a doorway, and one will find a man sleeping there.  One can go to the bottom of Kildare Street and turn left down Nassau Street in the direction of Grafton Street, and one will find a person sleeping in a doorway there also.  There is something particularly symbolic in people having to sleep on the streets within 200 metres of the governing Parliament of the State.  However, I accept we are making progress.If we moved every homeless person off the streets and into hostels and shelters, we would not end homelessness, although we would make homelessness less visible or perhaps invisible.  My Bill of 22 years ago stated that a person forced to live in a night shelter or hostel was homeless.  A shelter or hostel is not a home for anybody.  The MakeRoom campaign recognises that to end homelessness, provide for homeless people and ensure that homelessness is a problem of the past it is not sufficient to provide night shelters and hostels, however good they are.  I accept shelters and hostels are better than they used to be but they are a step on the road to ending homelessness, not the solution.The MakeRoom campaign emphasises the need to recognise that nobody ends up homeless simply by accident.  There is a process that happens to people.  The first indicator of a likelihood of becoming homeless is poverty.  There is a tendency for everybody in church and State to say: "It could happen to anybody."  The church person will come up with a story of the member of the clergy who descended into homelessness while the State person will come up with a similar story.  They are seen as sad and tragic stories but as exceptions.  It must be remembered that homeless people are poor people who have fallen through the limited nets available for them.  Therefore, any way of dealing with homelessness involves dealing with poverty.The consequences and, less often, the causes of homelessness are considerable social and personal distress which can manifest itself in psychological and mental disorders, serious ill health and serious and sometimes scary anti-social behaviour. I speak having had a few interesting experiences in my time with the Simon Community.  Most of this is a consequence of homelessness or is the reason people became homeless.  Therefore, the motion recognises the need for integrated services.I thought there was an agreed position in this regard.  I thought, because I had read references to this in Cork, where I am still involved slightly with the Simon Community, that the Health Service Executive and the local authorities had accepted that one cannot simply deal with homelessness as a housing issue alone.  In the old scholastic logic tradition, housing is a necessary but not a sufficient remedy for homelessness.  One cannot solve homelessness without housing provision but one will not solve it by housing provision alone.I thought we had reached that stage until I read the most ungracious Government amendment.  I am astonished that the line in the motion "acknowledges the commitment of these [four] organisations to the care of homeless people in Ireland", which is recognised by every citizen, was left out of the Government amendment by choice.  Whoever drafted the amendment, could the Government not at least have had the grace to recognise the commitment and extraordinary service of the four organisations?Unfortunately, the amendment does not respond to the complexity of homelessness and it only recites Government achievements relating to housing.  Housing is a necessary condition to deal with homelessness but there is not sufficient availability nor does it address the entire problem.  The Government raised the housing issue in this debate but if it is going to deal with homelessness, it must support the homeless and others who are threatened with homelessness.  If I had time, I could go through the multiple steps of alienation.The Government claims to have taken action regarding housing but it has not done so, particularly in the private rented accommodation sector where the absence of standards is a scandal.  The PRTB, the Revenue, local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government do not share their data so that everybody knows what everybody else is doing.  Advertisements printed in local newspapers that state "no rent allowance" provide a signal that the owners do not pay tax on the rent.  The only reason they will not take in people on rent allowance is they are afraid they will get caught for tax.  Every one of those advertisements should be investigated by the Revenue.  The cap on supplementary welfare allowance is causing enormous hardship.  I conducted a quick check on www.daft.ie earlier.  Only three apartments in inner city Dublin advertised on the website meet the rental conditions of the SWA scheme, while no accommodation is available to rent at under €500 per week in Galway city.I am greatly disappointed the Government chose to have a confrontation rather than seeking a consensus and, instead of dealing with homelessness, it decided to table an amendment touting its own successes.  In view of this I will use my reply to the debate to list the Government's failures.  That is not what I intended to do, as I wanted to move the homelessness debate to a new level.  However, we are back to the silly politics in regard to this issue, from which I had hoped we had moved.  I am very disappointed.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I am happy to second the motion and, like Senator Ryan, I am very disappointed with the Government parties' amendment because they should have no problem with our motion.  However, it is opportune, as the budget approaches and as we experience one of the worst days weather-wise we have had in a long time, that we should discuss the homelessness issue and review the current position.  It would be great to say progress is being made, which the Government has attempted to do in its amendment but, unfortunately, that is not the case.The number of homeless people has doubled since 1996.  In 2002, 5,581 people were homeless, 87% of whom were to be found in urban areas.  Those who sleep on the street visibly demonstrate homelessness but Focus Ireland points out that there is more than one category of homelessness.  The organisation refers to the visible homeless sleeping rough on the street and those who stay in emergency accommodation in shelters but it also highlights the hidden homeless, who comprise individuals and couples who are forced to share accommodation with relatives, such as young couples who cannot afford to rent or buy and must live at home or with friends or people in insecure or substandard accommodation.Despite recent legislative changes which attempted to bring landlords into line and address substandard accommodation, that is not happening.  In addition, people are at risk of homelessness because of economic difficulties, for example, if rent becomes too expensive or if they experience health difficulties, marital breakdown or mental illness.  Inevitably, some of these people will become homeless because the triggers for homelessness are poverty, marital breakdown, employment loss and mental ill-health.  The necessary progress on this issue has not been made and new problems are emerging, such as homelessness among the migrant community.  A number of immigrants have travelled to Ireland to earn a living but they have not succeeded and they have found themselves in straitened circumstances similar to Irish people in London and other cities during periods of significant migration.I represent an area that does not experience homelessness to the same extent as Dublin or Cork but it lurks in the background.  I am occasionally approached, like other public representatives, by individuals and couples who have nowhere to live because they cannot continue to stay with a relative or friend or their rented accommodation is being sold and they cannot obtain suitable replacement accommodation.  They ask what I can do and, in many cases, they are accommodated in bed and breakfasts and hotels.  That is a short-term measure, which is not suitable for children, in particular.  The average time spent in emergency bed and breakfast accommodation has increased from only 20 days in 1993 to 18 months in 2006.  There is widespread use of such accommodation, which is expensive for the taxpayer and which is not appropriate for the people involved.  It may be considered a short-term solution but it is not in many cases.  It does not work and it highlights that there is a serious underlying problem.The shortage of affordable rented accommodation is a contributory factor.  The cost of housing has shot through the roof because of the property boom and rented accommodation is expensive, especially for those on low incomes.  All groups working in this area, such as Focus Ireland and the Simon Community, point to the need for affordable rented accommodation as an essential in any strategy to tackle homelessness.In 2000 the Government launched Homelessness — An Integrated Strategy.   A review conducted on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the implementation of the strategy stated progress was mixed.  For instance, the establishment of night shelters was recommended but that has been a hit and miss initiative.  New shelters have not been established in the northern suburbs of Dublin city, despite the need for them.  A new wave of homelessness is being experienced by the immigrant community and victims of domestic violence.I refer to the link between mental illness and homelessness.  As we know, there is a move away from large institutional care for people with mental illnesses.  In general, our community must support that move, but it does not work for a number of people.  Given that in many parts of the country, including north County Tipperary, the services on the ground are insufficient to meet the needs of people with mental illnesses, people will inevitably fall through the cracks.  People with mental illnesses must be considered as one of the most vulnerable groups in terms of being prone to homelessness.No examinations of the issues around mental ill health and psychiatric care can be complete without an examination of the implications for people who become homeless.  This is the last point I have time to make and I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak.  I also thank Senator Ryan for tabling this important motion.  I ask that Government parties support the motion because it is not too late to do so.

While the debate is timely, we are discussing the issue on one of the worst days of the year in terms of weather.  I agree with Senator Ryan regarding the number of people near this building who are homeless.  While there is much emphasis on the homeless situation in Dublin and other major cities, there are difficulties for people in parts of rural Ireland, particularly persons who do not want to move to bigger towns and cities.The issue of youth homelessness, which has been discussed, arose on "Liveline" several times during the summer in respect of families' serious difficulties, namely, the hell on earth families go through when young people cannot get on with their parents or guardians.  Much as on any "Liveline" programme, the different views were interesting.  Some people said young people should be put out of their houses or accommodated in some way with the help of social workers and other agencies.  I welcome the reduction in the figures relating to homeless children.  Last year, the figure was 460, but in 2002, it was 1,405, a reduction of 67%.  Senator Ryan accepted this trend.  Between 2002 and 2005, the global figures relating to homeless persons have decreased.  This is the good news.In rural Ireland, many single people are not helped.  In every local authority, there is a tendency to house families, but the traditional family no longer exists.  People in their 40s and 50s who try to get accommodation experience significant difficulties.  I applaud the fact that some local authorities will now provide housing for people in that category.Long before phrases such as "social and affordable housing", Galway County Council tried to reserve at least 10% of its housing estates for elderly people, lone parents or the homeless, which was a good policy.  Emigrants were often mentioned in that context.  Through social and affordable housing, that figure is currently 20%, but there is a vacuum in terms of the difficulties faced by returning emigrants when trying to get housing.  Special regard should be given to them because they have worked hard all of their lives.  Perhaps they did not have proper pensions in their workplaces or where they lived, but they deserve consideration.When schemes are put in place by the voluntary sector, which has done great work, I hope they are built to the highest standard.  A voluntary organisation known as the Clúid Housing Association — clúid means shelter — has established many good schemes.  It has been concerned about security, particularly for older people, and there is a house for an estate caretaker in each scheme.  When CCTV systems are rolled out, I urge that they be made available to those housing schemes.The important issue of rent was referred to.  Higher rent is paid for voluntary housing than for local authority housing.  Why is this the case and will it be examined?  Regarding the assessment of needs, I welcome the decrease in the numbers on waiting lists, the result of a positive investment in social and affordable housing.  I hope the Minister's plans for 2007-09 will be fulfilled.  I welcome the MakeRoom campaign's examination of homeless persons centres.  It is trying to help people who want to get out of homelessness.I understand the Minister will examine the limit on the amount of rent.  Senator Ryan gave figures concerning how expensive rent is in places such as Dublin and Galway city, which I know has a difficulty in this respect.  That the Department of Social and Family Affairs is reviewing the rent supplement and the rent limits to determine the limits that should apply from next January is important.  If one speaks with any community welfare officer, he or she will say there is a real difficulty.  From January, we will need definite figures, but I am sure some of these issues will be addressed by the budget in December.When we discuss rent, another issue is that of proper standards.  In September, we were told that under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, 123,000 properties were registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Some of the funding is used to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation.  The regulations must be implemented and they must be enforced properly.I welcome that there are some improvements, which every Senator would acknowledge, but the work of Focus Ireland, the Simon Community of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold is admirable.  I hope they continue their good work and that the Government can address the question of homeless persons as quickly as possible.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  On behalf of Fine Gael, I support the Labour Party motion and give our support to the MakeRoom campaign, the launch of which we attended in October.As we speak, 22 children under 12 are homeless on our streets, according to figures compiled by the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children.  These are the children whom the Celtic tiger has forgotten.  They are the children on whom the Government has turned its back.  They live in one of the richest countries in the world but they are not getting, nor looking for, luxuries.  They are not expecting places at private schools, exotic holidays or expensive gifts for Christmas.  What they are looking for is a warm, loving and caring home, which is the right of every young child.  Instead they face a winter of extreme cold and extreme danger on the streets.If we had read about it in Dickens we would be horrified, but thankfully times have changed.  In fact, times have not changed and they will not change under this Minister's watch.  The Government has a target of ending homelessness by 2010 which, even were it to be met, would be too late for these children.  It also had a target of ending sleeping rough by 2004 so I am not too optimistic about the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats commitment to a 2010 end to homelessness.The facts on homelessness have been stark in the past nine years and remain stark today.  By March 2005, 43,684 households were still waiting for a local authority house, and many housing bodies say this is an underestimation, which I believe.  There are 5,581 homeless people in Ireland but the Simon Community claims the overall figures are a gross underestimation, which I also believe.  In Dublin, 4,060 people are homeless.  There are 492 homeless children in Ireland, the majority of whom are in their mid to late teens, with the highest number being recorded in urban areas such as greater Dublin with 210.  The next highest is the south with 132, the west has 46 and the mid-west has 43.  The lowest figures were in the north west, where five children were found to be homeless.  The overall number of homeless children grew from 476 in 2003 to 492 in 2004.Adding to the statistics of Irish homeless, the Polish Embassy has said there may be as many as 600 homeless Polish people in Ireland.  According to voluntary aid workers, more than 300 Polish emigrants sleep rough in Dublin every night.  Most of the homeless gravitate towards the Phoenix Park, bus shelters and Garda stations.  As Senator Ryan pointed out, we see people living rough in doorways not 100 yards from this House.  With the Polish population currently standing at 90,000 and growing, the homelessness problem has become a major issue in the past few months.  Some 10% of St. Vincent de Paul's night shelter beds are now occupied by homeless Poles.  Focus Ireland has warned that Polish and other migrant workers are almost certain to become Ireland's new homeless poor within the next five years due to an inevitable downturn in the economy.  Their problems will be reminiscent of those the Irish in London faced some decades ago.The MakeRoom campaign, supported by Focus Ireland, the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold, four national voluntary organisations working in the area of homelessness and housing, is for everyone who wants to see an end to homelessness in Ireland.  Those agencies hope it will provide an opportunity for politicians, voluntary organisations, families, individuals and communities to be part of the debate and part of the solution.The MakeRoom campaign stresses that a comprehensive strategy is needed to prevent homelessness.  It believes each person, regardless of income or housing status, must have the opportunity to access vital services, and to redress if his or her needs are not adequately met.  It also believes that Government policies should not contribute directly to trapping people in homelessness.The six policy planks on which the MakeRoom campaign focuses are responding to what people need, more and better housing, support to leave homelessness, renting on a low income, proper standards in renting, tackling poverty and preventing homelessness.  This is not rocket science and the Government should not have to think too hard to achieve these aims.We should not have a debate on such an important issue simply to be negative and my party has developed a good policy in this area to tackle homelessness once and for all.  To do that, we are convinced of the need for the State to invest heavily in move-on accommodation.  Such housing is designed both to assist homeless people to move out of homelessness and to ensure vulnerable people do not become homeless.  In essence, it provides a semi-sheltered environment for those who cannot cope with independent living.It goes without saying that the Government's shameful failure to deliver on the social housing units it has repeatedly promised is adding to the problem.  It is also vital that the root causes of homelessness, such as poverty and the twin scourge of drug abuse and alcohol dependency, are tackled.  More social housing is urgently needed as the current supply is not adequate to meet demand.  The number of social houses made available under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is also below expectations.  In the second quarter of 2006, 1,358 social houses were provided, approximately 6.2% of total houses built in that period.  The work of voluntary housing associations needs to be supported, as they cannot and should not be expected to meet the demand for their services unaided.  The Government has neglected those in certain areas, as will be confirmed by anyone involved in those organisations.Fine Gael shares the belief of organisations like Focus Ireland that the legislative definition of homelessness is too narrow.  Rather we need to look at three groups for the real picture. They are the visible homeless who sleep rough or in emergency shelters and bed and breakfasts, the hidden homeless who live in inadequate, unsuitable or insecure accommodation and those at risk of homelessness, as well as those who are not homeless but are in danger of becoming so due to economic, familial or health difficulties.Fine Gael remains committed to full implementation of existing Government strategies and will work towards the implementation of the independent review of the Government's homeless strategy.  The review of the implementation of the Government's integrated and preventative homeless strategies examined the actions recommended to tackle and prevent homelessness and local authorities' action plans in response to the strategies.  It shows that a lot more remains to be done in the areas of long-term accommodation, co-ordination between Government agencies dealing with homelessness, the development of a case management approach to meeting the needs of the homeless and preventative strategies for other groups at risk of homelessness.Again, I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion and I wish the MakeRoom campaign every success in tackling the continual presence of homelessness.  The Minister of State has statistical figures but they are not accurate in many cases.  I have learnt from discussions with local authorities around the country that there is a huge underestimation in the numbers of homeless today.  What has the Government done in the past couple of years?  It has changed the format of the housing application document.  Many people find it difficult to complete that document so they abandon it and continue to live rough on the streets.  The figures the Minister has quoted over recent years are inaccurate.  People involved in supporting the homeless will confirm that.  I am not happy with the distorted figures offered by the Minister.  In the not too distant future we will have more accurate figures that will shame him and his Government on this issue.

The issue of homelessness is one in which all Members have a keen interest, especially in the current economic climate.  We all hope to arrive at a position where there will no longer be homeless people on our streets.  Equally, however, we must acknowledge that there are many and varying reasons for homelessness.  In this debate I will concentrate on a new element of homelessness which arises from the expansion of the EU.I have had a series of meetings with the Cork Simon Community and the Cork Homeless Forum in this regard and as a result, some interesting statistics have come to hand.  I will highlight them because they must be included in the overall debate on this issue.  In Cork city significant progress has been made in recent years in ending homelessness.  Due to a strong and productive partnership approach by all the relevant and statutory agencies, a significant base of expertise and provision has been developed that has enabled the Cork Homeless Forum to be effective in its approach to addressing a broad spectrum of issues related to homelessness.The forum's first action plan was produced in 2000 and it was subsequently revised in 2005.  It included an extensive range of specific actions incorporating timescales for delivery and inbuilt evaluation processes.  A comprehensive consultative process with all key stakeholders informed the development of these action plans.  The report published last year, the review of the Government's homeless strategies by Fitzpatrick Associates, described the approach in Cork as an example of good practice that all local homeless forums could follow, regardless of the nature of the specific problems within their areas.  I congratulate those associated with it.Notwithstanding the positive impact the Cork Homeless Forum is having on homelessness in Cork, an issue is now emerging to put pressure on the homeless services in the city.  An increasing number of people from some of the EU accession states are getting into difficulties, ending up sleeping rough and living in tents or other unsuitable accommodation.  Many have poor English language skills and access to social welfare support is limited.  While the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the community welfare officers have been doing all they can to help alleviate some of the difficulties being encountered by people from these EU states, they must work within the parameters of the habitual residence condition or HRC.  They are, therefore, restricted in the level of help and support they can offer.This situation is further compounded by the direction that local authorities have received from the Department to the effect that people from the EU states who present as homeless should not be accommodated unless they satisfy the requirements of the HRC.  This, in turn, has limited the scope of local authorities and voluntary agencies to respond.  We must examine this situation.  It is newly emerged and I believe we can tweak the regulations and move in a certain direction to help alleviate these problems.There are interesting statistics regarding how this problem has grown.  In 2005, the Cork Simon Community, in monitoring homelessness in the city, found that 16% of residents at its emergency shelter were from the EU accession states.  An average of 27% of service users in the Cork Simon Community day centre were from these states.  Another 19% of people living rough and 25% of the people availing of temporary cold weather shelter over the Christmas and new year period of 2005 were from EU accession states.This trend increased dramatically in 2006.  A total of 58 of the current 491 service users in the Cork Simon Community day centre were from the EU states while 35% of all people living rough were EU immigrants.  Throughout January during the nightly soup run volunteers made contact with an average of 19 people per night but in February this increased to 25.  This compares with an average of three people from EU states in the same period in 2005.The Cork Simon Community outreach team said in a report that the majority of EU nationals arriving in this country who find themselves in difficulty have basic English language skills or none at all.  Many arrive with little more than €200 and high expectations of finding work immediately.  Most are unaware of the cost of living or of the high cost of private rented accommodation.  While the majority have skills related to the construction industry, most do not have the required Safe Pass to work in the building trade nor the resources to acquire the Safe Pass.  Their level of awareness of their rights and entitlements under employment legislation is low.  As a result they are vulnerable to exploitation and at a further risk of homelessness.Many travel here in search of their fortune.  We must acknowledge this.  The key issues highlighted by the Cork Simon Community in this regard are that these people have no income, no access to suitable accommodation, limited capacity to access employment and little or no support from the statutory or voluntary agencies.  Of the 105 people the organisation came into contact with in the relevant period, 80% had no income.  It should be noted that the HSE and community welfare officers are aware of the situation and they continue to be proactive in helping individuals case by case who find themselves in difficulty.  However, they are still required to work within the parameters of the HRC and are, therefore, restricted in the level of help and support they can give.Existing accommodation services for homeless people are specialist in their nature.  They were established to respond to the specific needs of people with addiction, mental health and other support needs.  These services are in high demand and are experiencing full occupancy on an ongoing basis.  The accommodation needs of people coming from the EU are primarily economic and employment related and neither the State nor the voluntary sector has responded adequately to them.  Existing homeless services do not have the spare capacity and were not designed to respond adequately to their needs.  This lack of alternative homeless services and alternative sources of support for people from the EU who are in difficulty has the potential to displace other people who are homeless.We can move in a certain direction on this issue with a little thought.  There are a growing number of homeless people from the EU, and existing services that are designed to respond to a specific range of needs of people who are homeless are not an appropriate response to their needs.  These services are already functioning to capacity.Perhaps the Minister of State will consider a number of options.  I ask him to examine the option of repealing the habitual residence condition.  I ask this not in an effort to play politics but in an effort to make a contribution to this debate.  The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 is having an unintentional but noticeable impact on a small but growing number of men and women from the EU states who arrive to this country to work.  The financial destitution and subsequent homelessness of people from these states can be immediately addressed and resolved.Repealing the HRC would help alleviate the financial destitution, assist people in attempting to access private rented accommodation, support people in attempting to develop English language skills and assist them in accessing our labour market.  All statistics show we need these people in our labour market.  I do not believe we should be so strict and stringent in not accommodating them.We should also extend the remit of the Reception and Integration Agency to include short-term accommodation.  Consideration should be given to this so that we can provide immigrants with short-term accommodation while they establish themselves.  We should also provide clarity and direction to local authorities and voluntary agencies for dealing with these people.  The establishment of an integrated referral service to assist people from the EU member states to move to independent living could go a long way towards helping them.We have all heard the stories of the Irish abroad.  It is the first weeks and months that people coming here find most difficult.  They have come here to work, not to live off social welfare.  We should meet and encourage them and help them get set up.  I ask for this to be considered.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	169	This is an important debate.  I am sorry to see that once again the Government has introduced an amendment.  We are all on the same side on this issue and it is unnecessary for this sort of amendment.  All the amendment has done is remove some references from the motion and added more, mostly praise of the Government, but it is basically clear we are moving in the same direction.  I am puzzled by the removal of any mention of Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold, particularly as the Government side of the House frequently invoke and praise these groups.  I do not understand the reason these names had to be removed or why they were not acknowledged.  The requests of the MakeRoom campaign are ones that are supported by the Government side, so I cannot understand why in the name of God we have this awful adversarial system.Senator Minihan made an excellent contribution and I support his call for the removal of the habitual residence qualification, which principally affects people from European countries like Poland.  In today's paper there is a sad picture of a young man unconscious in hospital.  He collapsed outside the Merchant's Quay Project, which is among the groups that briefed us for this debate, and was taken to hospital where he has been unconscious ever since.  His entire possessions consisted of a small amount of Polish currency.  This situation is a reproach to all of us and one with which we must deal.Who are the homeless?  We know who they are because we have a definition in the Housing Act.  The Act provides that a person is homeless:If there is no accommodation available which, in the opinion of the authority, he, together with any other person who normally resides with him or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him, can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of...or . . .(b) he is living in a hospital, countyhome . . .and has no other means.The Merchant's Quay people have broken down the homeless into three categories.  First, the visible homeless who are those people we see, even on the steps of our great public buildings.  It is a cause of distress to many of us to see these people settling down for the night.  These are not all stereotypical old people and drunkards, but young people who should be on the threshold of life.  The second group is the hidden homeless who are people who are staying with relatives and so on who do not possess their own home.The third group is the people at risk of homelessness.  This is a growing section because, despite our increasing wealth and our satisfactory position on the world table, we have a situation where property is increasingly placed outside the capacity of young people to afford.  The cost of housing has gone completely off the register.  The house I bought in 1978 for €25,000 is now valued at €3.5 million, which is insane.It is difficult to know how many homeless people we have.  We can take a snapshot, but homelessness and the number of people we can detect as homeless change.  There are approximately 5,000 homeless people.  This is worrying and reflects the fact that housing has become increasingly unaffordable.On the matter of affordable housing, it is a shame the Government has so often colluded with property developers in the avoidance of this responsibility.  It has allowed them hand over parcels of useless land or money so that the middle class occupants of their developments will not be troubled or distressed by having to live beside people who come from a slightly different social background with a different accent.  In 2002, there was a total of 102,000 local authority houses, but we had some 48,000 households on the waiting list.  We need to take a look at this situation.Homelessness has an impact on people's welfare.  The average life expectancy of somebody on the streets is 42 years, yet this week we heard that women born today can expect to live to 100 years of age.  People on the streets are also more prone to diseases such as TB and hepatitis and to drug addiction, etc.I would like to end on a positive note.  The ready for work programme is sponsored by the various groups involved in homelessness and by one of our banks.  This initiative gives us a different view of the homeless who are often dismissed as shiftless or of having brought it on themselves.  Since 2002, out of 178 referrals to the ready for work project some 118 or 66% began training.  Of these, 95% completed the training and most went on to employment or to further training or education.  It is marvellous that people from such a disadvantaged background could be assisted to get up and do something for themselves.I like to put the human face on these issues.  A woman was kicked out of home when she was 18 years of age and slept in doorways and begged all over the city.  She now has two children and is in the business in the communities return to work scheme, assisted by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  She said:  "It is very strange having people respect me, if you know what I mean.  When I was on the streets I just kept my head down.  No-one hardly ever looked at me.  It was horrible.  Looking back to that time, it was just what was happening".  This is one person who has been given hope.  We have the resources and can do it.I salute Senator Ryan and his colleagues for putting forward this important motion and I hope that more will be done.  We should stick together and should not be divided by silly, unnecessary, adversarial amendments.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I thank Senators Norris and Henry for allowing me to share their time.  I support the motion and the opportunity to have this debate.  I was in Brazil last week to explain the Irish economic miracle.  While I was there I never mentioned homelessness because I am ashamed that I cannot explain how such a successful country can have a solvable problem like this.I have been trying to do something about educational disadvantage which is a significant problem that will not be solved easily or over a short period.  Homelessness is solvable.  The answer is in the motion put down by Senator Ryan, which puts forward six proposals for the Government and asks it to do something about the situation.  The problem can be solved by providing the financial resources required.  The nation is swamped with money as a result of our economic miracle.  The Government must act with determination and decide the issue is a high priority about which it can do something.  We have the answers in the motion, which is being supported by this side of the House.I too am disappointed the Government put down an amendment that does not mention the specific solutions offered by the MakeRoom campaign.  These are supported by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland and the other groups and is doable.  It will cost money, but we have the money to do it.  The Government must just determine to act on the issue.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I am very surprised the Government amendment does not mention the organisations which have put so much work into the area of homelessness.  I would like to include others such as the Salvation Army, Los Angeles Society for homeless boys and Ruhama.One group not mentioned in connection with homelessness is that of prisoners leaving prison, some of whom have nowhere to go when they come out.  There are far too few hostels run by the charities that cater for them.  Unfortunately, when planning permission is sought by some groups to provide housing for people coming out of prison, local people object to the granting of permission.  Homeless people have multiple needs.We need to give more attention to the issue as it affects children.  When the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, was Minister of State with responsibility for children, she was frequently told that homeless children were children who were out of home.  Given that they are frequently out of home as a result of physical or sexual abuse, that was no explanation.  We have to provide services, including foster care, for these children if we are going to stop them from sleeping rough or turning to prostitution, drugs and crime.  In that regard, I was delighted to note the increase in the number of foster parents for older children.Those who are mentally ill and homeless also face particular difficulties.  Health services for the mentally ill are provided on a sectoral basis, so if a person stops taking his or her medication and is found in the wrong sector, it can be difficult to access the proper treatment.Homeless people encounter terrible problems in terms of finding employment, even after they have found a roof over their heads. Several surveys have been conducted which indicate that people living in hostels rarely receive replies when they send curriculum vitae to prospective employers.I support the motion and regret that the Government parties were not in a position to do likewise.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the important issue of homelessness.  We tend to take our homes for granted but being homeless is not just a matter of bricks and mortar or four walls and a roof.  The comfort of family and neighbours, safety in a community, access to health and education services and a sense of hope are also important.  There are complex reasons behind an individual becoming homeless, especially where addiction or mental illness is involved.  However, homelessness can also result from simple circumstances.When it comes to hostel and bed and breakfast accommodation, we have to reconsider the definition of homelessness.  I have encountered individuals and families who had to leave their bed and breakfast accommodation at 9 a.m. and remain on the streets until evening, sometimes purely because of bureaucracy.Addressing homelessness involves providing people with the resources they need to make a choice.  There will always be exceptions to the rules or people who do not fit into a box, and some will try to take advantage of the system.  The people who make decisions on the problems associated with homelessness must be given the flexibility to make allowances for exceptional circumstances.  It is not easy to accommodate a person with, for example, addiction related needs.  A multi-agency approach is required, as well as understanding and support from the wider community.Appropriate accommodation and back-up services on an ongoing basis in health, employment and education are in the interest of everybody, not only clients of homeless services.  The Government has done a great deal of work on social inclusion but if somebody is to be socially included, he or she has to be accepted by the community rather than highlighted as different.  Unfortunately, some organisations fail in this area, giving rise to problems for the individuals concerned and for the wider community.I wish to make a special plea with regard to health services for homeless people.  The vast majority of homeless people do not have medical cards, so when they fall ill, they are usually referred by a GP or brought by ambulance to an accident and emergency department, where they tend to spend more time than other patients.  For various reasons, they also spend more time in the general hospital system.  However, when they recover, they are sent back out to the cold and rain in a vicious circle.  I congratulate Dr. Austin O'Carroll and his colleagues in the Mountjoy Street Family Practice on the submission they have made with regard to providing an intermediate care centre for homeless people which could offer a range of statutory, treatment and back-up services in a central location.  However, that is only one part of an array of necessary measures because there is no quick-fix solution to this problem.While the overall number of homeless people has decreased and significant progress has been made, as the amendment notes and organisations dealing with homelessness acknowledge, statistics indicate that the age at which people become homeless is decreasing, the number of homeless females is increasing and people tend to be homeless for longer periods.  Drug addiction and its accompanying ailments, such as blood infections and transmissible diseases, are increasingly prevalent among homeless people.  Some 64% of homeless people have used drugs at some stage, while a quarter continue to use drugs.  I commend Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Threshold and the other agencies who deal with these complex and difficult issues on a daily basis.Providing a home is a more complex matter than merely giving someone a room and, in this regard, I commend Dublin City Council on its close collaboration with homeless agencies and the successful initiatives, such as the night bus, which it has taken.  I encourage the council to continue to explore the issue of single person accommodation, although accommodation must also be provided to families.  While Dublin City Council has taken several successful initiatives on the north side of the city to provide social housing for young families, single person accommodation remains a significant issue in the inner city.  Many single people who lack a home tend to congregate in the inner city because that is where most services are based.  People have referred to the problems which have arisen as a result of that in locations not far from where we are standing.The amendment points out all the advances that have been made.  It is widely accepted, having regard to Towards 2016, that it is possible to tackle the vast majority of these problems by 2010 but there are no quick fixes.  A comprehensive holistic approach must be taken to this issue.  The Department, in conjunction with all the other agencies, is working extremely hard to address it.  We will continue to provide the resources for it.As we near Christmas, which is a time when we focus on our homes and families, we should realise this is a perennial issue.  It is complex in many areas but much work has been done.  I congratulate the Minister and the Department on what has been achieved so far.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Senator O'Meara mentioned the hidden homeless.  As a former county councillor, my experience of homelessness would be more in terms of the hidden homeless and dealing with people who have been on the housing list for years.Another aspect is the problems to which the housing crisis is contributing.  For example, some relationships never get off the ground because the couple and their child have waited for housing for many years during which time they had to live apart.  In those circumstances the relationship never gets a chance to develop and all concerned are affected in a detrimental way by that.There are also the people who lose the opportunity, because of our housing policy, to have a career because of the catch-22 situation they are in regarding the rent supplement scheme and all that involves.  If they were housed in council accommodation there would not be any catches in that regard.  They could get a job and improve their circumstances.Health issues arise also.  Someone may suffer from ill-health but if they become homeless it makes matters much worse.  If people with drug abuse problems do not have secure accommodation, it will not help their circumstances.I have been provided figures by Focus Ireland which indicate that a large number of children are homeless.  More than 35,000 children have a housing need.  Every second homeless child in Dublin is under the age of five.  Those statistics are very worrying.I have experience of dealing with people who are homeless.  They are living in bed and breakfast accommodation in Dublin although they are from my constituency in Dublin Mid-West.  They must travel into town each day to bring their children to school.  Sometimes they do not do that and the children's education is affected.  If the parents of the children have a drugs problem, for example, and are living in homeless accommodation, such as bed and breakfast premises, the children are separated from the family network that could fill the gap if their parents are unable to look after them properly.  Those are the hidden problems behind the housing crisis. There have been many lost opportunities and issues created by the fact that we have not tackled the housing crisis in the past few years.Every public representative here will have had the experience of people who have been on the housing list for years telephoning us in tears because of their circumstances.  I have dealt with people who, for whatever reason, ended up living in a rundown caravan with no water or electricity.  They were living in terrible deprivation.There are many problems with the way the housing crisis is being dealt with by the Government and we need to review it.  I will quote some statistics from a recent article in a Jesuit magazine by Fr. Peter McVerry.  He made the point that one of the reasons so many people are on the housing list and so many are homeless is because the issue of the price of housing land has never been dealt with.  The Minister of State's brother, the Taoiseach, made a big deal of the last report on property rights issued by the all-party committee on the Constitution but that report is sitting on a shelf.  Nothing has been done about it and in the meantime, the average price of housing in Dublin and throughout the country has gone up by another €100,000 since the report was launched by the Taoiseach.The Government has made much of its plans for further housing.  I am in favour of affordable housing but, first, it has not been delivered to the extent people expected from the Government announcements about thousands of affordable houses coming on stream and, second, the affordable housing scheme should have operated in conjunction with the building of a substantial number of council houses.  Fr. McVerry made the point that the percentage of council housing as a proportion of the overall housing output is minimal compared with what used to be the case.  In the article he states:[In summary], in the 1970s and 1980s, new social housing, as a percentage of total housing output, was between 20% and 33%.  [Actually], from 1922 up to the mid-1960s, 50% of all housing output was social housing ... new social housing is well below 10%, despite the scale of need established by the local authorities assessments ...He mentions the report of the National Economic and Social Council which recommended that over eight years, from 2005 to 2012, there would need to be an increase of 73,000 units, net of tenant purchase, of council houses to deal with our housing waiting lists but in reality we have not got anywhere near that target.  From 1995 to 2004, 4,275 social housing units were provided each year, less than half the output recommended by the NESC, and when one takes into account the sale of local authority houses, the situation, according to Fr. McVerry, is much worse.  He states that to meet the target set by the NESC, the number of new local authority and voluntary housing units being provided would need to more than triple over the next seven years.This is an emergency and the Government has not tackled it in any real way, despite its claims.  I have heard the Minister say in the House that 90,000 houses were built this year but the majority of that is private housing.  When it comes to examining other ways of tackling social housing need, for example, through the rental supplement scheme, the onus appears to be on the private sector, which is based on profit making and is not concerned with meeting people's housing needs.I ask the Government to go back to basics on the housing issue and deliver a certain number of council houses each year.  It should ensure they are integrated but that should be the Government's focus.  Affordable housing is important but there are many drawbacks with that scheme.  It should not replace the need to provide council housing units.  We may look back in years to come and wonder if we made a mistake with affordable housing.  The Government owns the council house and if the occupants decide to buy it, they must purchase it.The affordable housing scheme has clawback provisions but they do not apply after 20 years and the State may be left with no equity in the houses.  The clawback provisions may, in themselves, generate hardship among the buyers of the dwellings because the dwellings tend to be apartments and are not supposed to be lived in for the rest of one's life.  The clawback provisions are such that many will end up staying in an affordable house because they will not be able to afford to move up in the market.It is very important to place major emphasis on getting county councils to deliver housing on the ground.  If they are not delivering as they should, they should be penalised.  County councils have a problem matching the funding they receive but the Government can do something about this.  There needs to be much more local authority housing and it should amount to 30% of overall housing output.  People should be able to purchase their local authority house if they have an opportunity to do so.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I thank Senators for their views and the opportunity to speak on the issue of homelessness, which we all accept is of major concern.  I welcome the overall goal of the MakeRoom campaign to end homelessness by 2010.  The campaign's representatives have indicated this means "nobody will sleep rough; nobody will stay in emergency accommodation for longer than is absolutely necessary and nobody will become homeless because of a lack of appropriate services".  This is very much the Government's goal also.  As we become more affluent, it becomes even more important to look after the vulnerable.The Government's commitment to tackling homelessness is clear and is evident from the funding provided.  Six or seven years ago, the Department provided just over €12 million on a national basis for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons.  This has increased to €50 million per year, which is a huge increase.  If the issue were only about accommodation, we would have solved it a long time ago.  It is much more complicated and it is not simply a question of building houses.In addition to the money spent by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Health and Children spends an additional 50% or more on care for the people in question.  Many homeless persons have very complex addiction and mental health problems.  Years ago such people were probably placed in psychiatric institutions but we are now more enlightened and let them out into the community.  Some, however, fall through the cracks and very often end up homeless.  Reference was made to the safety net for gaps in many services.  We must be aware of this but also note that it is not just a question of putting a roof over people's heads.  If it were, the solution would be much simpler.Since 2000, when Homelessness — An Integrated Strategy was published, the Government has provided some €450 million in capital and current funding for accommodation and care related services for homeless persons.  There have been very significant improvements in services for homeless people in recent years.  The integrated strategy recognised the need to address factors not only related to the provision of accommodation but also to health, care and welfare, education and training, and prevention in order to tackle homelessness effectively.  An interdepartmental committee is working on this.The Homeless Agency was established in Dublin as a partnership body to co-ordinate the delivery of homeless services.  Similarly, local homeless fora were established at city and county levels in the rest of the country.  These partnerships between local authorities, the Health Service Executive and other relevant statutory and voluntary organisations have developed three-year local homeless action plans.  The plans set out how accommodation, health, settlement, welfare and other services are to be provided to homeless persons in a co-ordinated fashion and they have been vital in achieving the progress made to date.  The partnerships have pulled together many strands and achieved co-ordination among voluntary groups and Departments, which is very important.The homeless preventative strategy, published four years ago, built on the achievements of the integrated strategy with the aim of providing a direct preventative response by targeting groups at risk of becoming homeless, including adult offenders, young offenders, those leaving mental health facilities and acute hospitals and young people leaving institutional care.  Senator Henry referred to people leaving prison but these people are catered for in the strategy.  If offenders are on temporary release, the system may not always work fully but it is meant to.  The strategy is such that people coming out of hospital or prison, or people from the Army who might have been living in an institutional set-up for a while, can be catered for through co-ordinated services, thus preventing the problem of homelessness from arising.Real improvements have been made, as evidenced by the falling number of homeless persons reported in Counted In 2005, the Homeless Agency's most recent periodic assessment of homelessness in Dublin.  The data indicate a 40% decrease in the number of rough sleepers and a 19% reduction in the number of homeless households, as compared with the figures in the assessment of 2002.Through the vital work of the local homeless fora, there has been significant progress.  The housing needs assessment 2005, which we published some months ago, recorded a 46% fall in the number of homeless persons nationally by comparison with previous years.  I am not suggesting everything is perfect or that the problem has gone away — it has not and will not, in the short term in any case — but circumstances have improved.  We are working very much with local authorities, the HSE and the voluntary bodies.  We fund the voluntary groups, which are part of the campaign and part of the Government's service provision.  Many of the services are of an outreach nature and many of the groups have availed of the capital grants to provide accommodation.The social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, contains a commitment to the elimination of the long-term occupancy of emergency homeless accommodation by 2010.  This is well-aligned with the goals of the MakeRoom campaign.  It also ties in with the Homeless Agency's overarching objective of eliminating, by 2010, long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough in Dublin.One will be aware of the Review of Implementation of Homeless Strategies, prepared by Fitzpatrick Associates and published earlier this year.  The consultants engaged in wide-ranging consultation with both homeless service providers and homeless persons as part of the review process.  The Government accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the review and is committed to taking them forward.  Work is under way in my Department on preparing a revised and updated strategy on homelessness, having regard to the recommendations of the review.We are at a crucial stage in addressing homelessness, a point with which the MakeRoom campaign would agree.  We have made good progress in dealing with the emergency aspects.  Senator Brady mentioned the Dublin City Council bus which brings individuals to emergency accommodation every night if they so need it.  Needs very much depend on the time of year.  Many of these people choose not to get on the bus or to accept a bed for the night, for whatever reason.  All our energies are spent on trying to attract such people to use these services.  If we can get them to use the services, we can build up a certain level of understanding and start to work with them to meet many of their other needs.  The need for a roof over their heads at night is just one of the many needs of homeless people, as I have said.Our current homeless population was largely identified in last year's housing needs assessment.  Systems and structures are being put in place to ensure that the long-term housing, care and support needs of homeless people are met.  The Department has an ongoing focus on supporting projects in the areas of tenancy sustainment and resettlement, as well as on moving people out of homelessness.  We all agree that a need exists in such areas.  There is enough emergency accommodation.  We are working with the agencies which are involved in the various projects to move people on.  That is a much slower process, however.  We are paying for various services which are run by the voluntary groups.  We are all frustrated by the results because things are not happening as quickly as we would like.  We cannot throw money at it and expect it to be solved six or nine months later.  We are dealing with complex people and complex problems.  The departmental projects I mentioned will involve the provision of a range of long-term accommodation options for homeless people, including the provision of social housing by local authorities and the voluntary housing sector through the local authorities' social and affordable housing action plans.I listened to Senator Tuffy's speech.  I remind her that a great deal of money is being spent.  The Department's housing Vote is approximately €2 billion per annum, €1 billion of which is being spent on what the Senator referred to as standard local authority housing.  We are trying to move away from that in many ways. We are trying to provide integrated housing estates, to develop the voluntary sector and to police the Part V guidelines.  We are trying to move away from the development of vast local authority housing estates.  Some €240 million of the €2 billion I mentioned is being spent on remedial works and regeneration as part of an attempt to correct the mistakes of previous decades.  I got the impression that Senator Tuffy is longing and yearning for the days when we developed nothing other than vast local authority estates, with hundreds of houses.  I assure the Senator that the days when we did that are gone.We are building approximately 6,000 local authority houses, 1,500 voluntary houses and 3,000 affordable houses each year.  We are meeting the needs of approximately 12,000 families each year.  Our spending on the national development plan is ahead of schedule.  We do not intend to develop vast housing estates as we did in the past in places like Ballymun, Clondalkin, Moyross, O'Malley Park and Sligo.  Ministers and other politicians thought at the time that it was great to dispense keys at a rate of knots, but 25 years on we are spending approximately €200 million each year on trying to correct the mistakes which were made when we had a vast throughput of housing.  Such a system is not the answer.  Senator Tuffy quoted a report that was produced by the National Economic and Social Council, but nobody ever quotes the Economic and Social Research Institute.  Perhaps we are all guilty of selectively quoting from the various Government agencies as it suits us.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The programme featured a complimentary piece about the scheme, which will be of huge benefit over time.  It is being developed slowly, but the people who are availing of it will be able to go back to work without losing their rent allowance payments, as they would have previously.  I accept that it is happening slowly as a result of various difficulties, but it will take those who avail of it out of one of the main poverty traps which exist.The MakeRoom campaign has raised issues relating to the rent supplement scheme and the affordability of rent generally.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is reviewing the rent limits of the rent supplement scheme to determine the limits which should apply from January 2007.  The action that is being taken to promote the reform and development of the private rented sector is helping to improve the availability of affordable rental accommodation.  Approximately 60,000 people, or 40% of the overall rental market, are availing of rent supplement payments.  If the Department were to continue to give larger amounts of money without watching what was happening, there would not be any point to it.  If the scheme is not properly focused and targeted, it will add to the overall price of renting.The MakeRoom campaign has called for the enforcement of stricter standards in private rented accommodation, which is a matter that is being addressed by the Government.  When I attended the launch of Threshold's annual report some weeks ago, I took the opportunity of announcing the Government's plans in that regard.  Towards 2016 includes a commitment to update and enforce effectively the minimum standards and regulations in the private rented sector.  Under the action programme that is being undertaken to promote further improvements in the standards in private rented accommodation, the regulations will be reviewed and an attempt will be made to provide for more effective enforcement.  When we started the rental accommodation scheme and inspected some of the accommodation in respect of which people were getting rent allowance, we found that some of the accommodation was very poor.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Like all Senators, I am aware of houses in my constituency and every other constituency in respect of which certain people have been getting rent allowance for many years.  The people in question know their accommodation is substandard, but we continue to give them rent allowance for such properties.  I do not know why we are doing that, especially as many of the 80,000 houses in question are being rented out to people who are in the homeless category.  They are getting the best of accommodation in houses which have been built relatively recently.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	194	That is as it should be.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I accept that such people are not in their own homes — they are in such accommodation on a short-term basis — and that they would like to be able to say they have a roof over their heads.  The notion that the standards in the private rented sector are all bad is not true, as much of the accommodation in that sector is very good.Accommodation alone will not solve homelessness.  We must provide the supports which are necessary to enable previously homeless persons to sustain long-term tenancies.  The independent review pointed out that the use of case management systems, the provision of services at local level, the effective operation of the local homeless forums and the establishment of a more formal and transparent funding system are crucial to continued progress.  I assure Senators that those issues are addressed in the Government's revised homelessness strategy, which is being prepared.  All the agencies which are involved in this area will have to buy into the process if we are to maximise the outcome of the revised strategy.  The voluntary sector, including the organisations which are sponsoring the MakeRoom campaign, has a fundamentally important role in providing accommodation and services for homeless people in a caring and compassionate manner.  I publicly acknowledge the value of the work being done by the voluntary sector.  I know it will continue its involvement, which is vital if the Government's strategy is to be implemented successfully.The voluntary sector and the Government are partners.  The Government is funding the voluntary sector.  We are working together.  The Government is providing the services on the capital side and on the services side in co-operation with the voluntary sector.  We are part of a single strategy for dealing with this issue.The independent review that I mentioned recommended the establishment of a national homeless consultative committee, which will operate through the Housing Forum.  Its aim will be to facilitate input by voluntary sector providers of homeless services at national level into the development of the revised homeless strategy and into ongoing Government policy in addressing homelessness.  We will be making the necessary arrangements for the establishment of this committee at an early date.Have I overstretched my time allocation?

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	197	The resources are being provided.  In tomorrow's Estimates, Members will see that more and more money is being provided for social housing.  We are well ahead on our expenditure on the national development plan in that area.  I accept that the figure for needs assessment is still at 43,000, but it is down 10%.  Approximately 40% of those included are single.Senator Brady correctly pointed out that many of those in need of accommodation are single people.  We keep trying to tell local authorities to look at the people on their list.  Some officials in local authorities consider that they can still build the same three-bed semis that they built 40 years ago.  We keep telling them to look at the people on their list and to build accommodation suitable to the needs of the people on it.  If 40% of them are single, the councils should be providing one or two-bedroom houses or apartments and not three-bed semis.  It seems to be quite hard to get through to them on this issue.To respond to Senator Tuffy, we have plenty of money for the local authorities.  We are driving them to spend what we give them, but they are supposed to follow the remit of the housing strategy.  They are supposed to tell us what amount of social housing is needed as they provide the information for the housing strategy and the action plan.  They tell us, we give them the money and we drive them all the time to use it.  I wish they were knocking on our door looking for more.  We are taking the initiative, especially at this time of the year.

I want units to be built and I expect something for providing the money.  However, the authorities have given us their strategies and plans and we are resourcing that.  If that is not enough, their officials should tell us.I welcome this debate.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.  We are all committed to solving this.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I support this motion and I commend the efforts of the voluntary organisations instrumental in supporting the MakeRoom campaign.  It is most regrettable that the Government's amendment deleted the names of the voluntary organisations.I am particularly interested in highlighting the plight of those within the justice system, many of whom enter and leave prison homeless.  According to Bishop Donal McKeown, speaking at the opening of the new legal year, half of the State's prisoners have a history of homelessness and two-thirds of these have spent time in a psychiatric hospital.  The Simon Community estimates that the provision of high-quality accommodation in the private rented sector, with a support worker, would cost €12,000 in a year.  The average cost of hospital psychiatric care is €120,000 a year.  To provide the same person with supported housing in a community environment would cost €40,000.Fine Gael proposes to deal with the threat of prisoners becoming homeless when they leave prison by giving prisoners with drug addiction problems the option of full addiction treatment and rehabilitation.  Currently, only those who are on the methadone maintenance programme prior to entering prison can avail of this treatment.  I believe that treatment must be provided for those who have a drug problem and for those who begin to abuse drugs while in prison.  Once they have left prison, we will provide increased work and educational facilities for all prisoners.  Prisoners who are drug free or on methadone maintenance must receive greater assistance to allow them to remain drug free once they leave prison through the use of a compulsory specialised pre-release programme.A strong link between housing and employment can be seen in the difficulty of holding down employment while homeless and sustaining accommodation while unemployed.  This creates a vicious circle out of which it is hard to break, particularly for newly released prisoners with previous addiction problems.  Little progress has been made on the proposal that the Prison Service build and provide transitional housing units as part of its strategy to prepare offenders for release, or on the proposal that education services for homeless adults be extended across the country.  It is essential that we provide a greater follow-up system and co-ordination between prison officials and probation services to monitor the progress of prisoners, once they leave the prison system.  It is envisaged that this would involve co-operation between prison staff, juvenile liaison officers and probation officers.Consideration must be given to support those who move on from being homeless.  Former homeless people, who tend to have few ties to family or community need continuing support after finding accommodation.  Many need continuing help to allow them to live outside an institutional setting.  According to the MakeRoom campaign, once a person is no longer considered homeless by the authorities, such support may be difficult to access.  The main reason given for this situation is that the funding mechanism is not in place for this eventuality.  Action in the new national homeless strategy on the barriers to participation in society of people who are homeless must include voting rights, participation in public policy formation, employment rights, access to financial services and so on.To extend the area even further, it is estimated that 60% of homeless people in London are Irish-born and help must also be given to these people.  Here in Ireland, I need not draw the attention of the Minister of State to the fact that he only has to leave Leinster House to see people sleeping wherever they can, in doorways, laneways and any other safe — I use the word advisedly — places they can find. Last night at 11 p.m., I walked 50 yards in each direction from the front gate of Leinster House and I counted six people bedded down for the night in doorways.  Governments and society are judged on how they treat the less well-off.  Based on what we see in the streets of Dublin and other locations throughout the country, I would suggest that we are failing  miserably to address this  problem.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I thank Senator Cummins for sharing time with me and I congratulate the Labour Party for putting down this motion.  I am disappointed that the Government has chosen to produce a self-congratulatory amendment when there was no need to do so.Today I read the report for 2005 by the Tallaght Homeless Advice Unit.  A total of 346 new clients used its service, which is an increase of 111% of the previous year.  It demolishes the myth that homelessness exists only in big cities or large towns.  There is a homeless problem in every Dublin suburb tonight and in any large or medium-sized town in the country.I agree with the Minister of State that it is not just a problem of temporary accommodation and that we have seen progress in this area in recent years.  There needs to be a change of heart and attitude by the local authority housing departments to put more emphasis on smaller units, especially for single men.  If there is one group of people which is losing out the most, whose members are ending up in chaotic lifestyles and circumstances, depending on their aunt, former partner or whoever, it is single men.  How can a single man, who may have a child or two, possibly hope to remain in touch with his offspring if he does not have any permanent accommodation?The message from tonight's debate regarding the general campaign of the voluntary organisations mentioned in the motion, which I support, is that there should be much more pressure on local authorities in Dublin to provide smaller units better tailored to the needs of men in particular who are rock-bottom and going nowhere on the housing list.  They have no chance of securing a house because their child lives with their former partner or spouse.  We must do much more to produce creative housing solutions for those men in particular, even if it is in a co-operative or community environment, with three or four men in separate bedrooms in a single unit.  One takes away a man's dignity if one denies him the right to see his child or children regularly.  They cannot do that in the current environment, since suburban Dublin does not provide enough or suitable housing units.The Tallaght Homeless Advice Unit, which is doing superb work in the Dublin 24 area, needs the support of local authorities and the Government to ensure that creative responses to the problems of homeless men and women can be found.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	210	All the relevant points have been raised.  I will take up where Senator Brian Hayes left off regarding the involvement of local authorities.  I like the name "MakeRoom" campaign, which says it all.  We must find simple accommodation — rooms rather than houses — to facilitate those who want to overcome homelessness.  I have often given a great deal of thought to why such people become homeless.  It is a major issue, and for many the problem is more than accommodation.  It is not simply a matter of finding a room, and I know of many who were facilitated with accommodation but within a few weeks were on the street again.  For whatever reason, they do not wish to be accommodated.Young people can become homeless because of a breakdown in their relationship with their parents or because of physical or mental abuse.  We must create the infrastructure for such people, and that is why the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children must become involved.  There must be joined-up thinking in this regard.  Services must be provided to accommodate and facilitate young people at risk.  I congratulate the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who has moved in the direction of home-school links regarding educational disadvantage.Many young people are on the street tonight because they cannot go home.  They are at risk, and we must spot that before the worst happens.  We should examine that area too, since it is not only a matter of accommodation.  Rather, the question is how to pick them up.  I compliment the city council on its night bus, along with the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland and all the voluntary agencies working in tandem with the Government to see how best we might tackle the problem.  The Minister of State has said that there is no quick fix.  However, local authorities have a major role, since they are in touch.I see nothing wrong with all those local centres being in a little room in Molesworth Street.  There should be several of them in the city centre.  They should be in south Dublin with drop-in centres in which they can assess needs, determine problems and decide how we might facilitate people.  I would increase the number of drop-in centres, and the best way to do so is to get each local authority area to provide such centres to facilitate people.  A preventative strategy is very important, and that is where the schools come in, since they have a major role in that.  For example, those leaving prison must be facilitated and the requisite infrastructure and services provided to assist their transition back into society.I have a great deal more to say, but time is short.  The Government is doing all it can, but there is no quick fix, and local authorities must do more.  I compliment the Government on the substantial sums that have been spent addressing the problem.  While the unbalanced Labour Party motion should have facilitated everyone's work, that was not the case.  I compliment the Taoiseach on the Government's work in tacking this problem, which will not go away.  It is easy to see that it is not solely a matter of accommodation, so let us provide the services to facilitate those at risk.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I thank Members for the debate's extremely positive tone and content.  It has been interesting, challenging, thoughtful and reflective.  Although we had a few cross exchanges, I include the speech by the Minister of State, which was quite constructive.In that context I cannot figure out who drafted the Government amendment, since no one in this Chamber used its tone or confrontational language.  A few weeks ago, we had another Minister here, who, in the face of the good sense of Fianna Fáil Senators, had to excise large parts of his speech and become a good deal more conciliatory than intended.  It is a pity that it did not happen here, since the issue is extremely important.  It is welcome that we have come so far in the tone of the debate; I have something of a history in this area, whether it is positive or negative.I will address one or two matters of great importance.  What Senator Minihan said regarding the new immigrant population becoming homeless highlights a matter of great urgency.  To start with, we need language skills so that people can speak to them.  I spent ten years of my adult life campaigning to get homelessness recognised as a problem, and we have spent the subsequent 25 years trying to deal with it.  I accept unequivocally that we are making progress, since things are better than they used to be.  However, we all agree that they are not ideal.  If we allow homeless immigrants to become another problem that must wait ten years to be recognised and another 25 to be resolved, we do both them and Irish society enormous harm.I am sceptical of the suggestion by the Minister of State that agencies set up by the State were co-ordinating voluntary groups.  The experience of voluntary groups is that they spend most of their time trying to co-ordinate State agencies that do not talk to or collaborate with each other, often being in competition.  The situation may be better now, but that was how things were.  Voluntary organisations have played a positive role in getting State agencies to face in the same direction and agree to the same agenda and to similar standards of service provision.On standards in private rented accommodation, I am at a loss as to why the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the tax system cannot be co-ordinated so that no one may register with the PRTB who has not been paying his or her tax and no one doing so is able to claim allowances.  One should meet certain standards before either is possible.  It is very simple; one would give a landlord a statement to certify that he or she was compliant.  He or she would sign it as a statement of fact — as happens with self-assessment for tax — and give it to the tenant, who would then be free to tell either the PRTB or the Revenue if the landlord was telling lies.  Through making it self-assessed, one would obviate the need for large armies of inspectors .  If, on the other hand, one is waiting for shyster landlords to improve who may make donations or campaign in elections, one will not do that.  There are plenty of ways to do so, however.The country's housing problem has reached crisis proportions.  Earlier this week, I came into possession of a submission from the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland to the Government in respect of the national development plan in which it was stated that unless the housing crisis is dealt with, US executives would find it difficult to come here to live because the level of house prices has reached ridiculous proportions.  One cannot provide housing for the poor if the richest in our country are beginning to feel that houses are becoming ridiculously expensive.  This is not the only issue at stake, but it is fundamental in nature.It is a great pity that the Government did not have the graciousness to recognise, in its amendment, the work of the voluntary sector.  That sector forced the State and a succession of Governments, including those of which my party was a member — albeit reluctantly at the outset — into providing a service.  To omit the voluntary sector from the Government amendment is, unfortunately, a good example of insensitivity.We could have reached a good consensus on this matter and engaged in a serious debate on the future of homelessness rather than hearing a succession of speeches of self-congratulation.  In light of the quality of life we currently enjoy, none of us should congratulate ourselves about how we cater for the homeless.  We have failed these people for 25 years.  I accept that things are improving but we remain in failure mode.  No one who enjoys the privileges enjoyed by Members of this House will be in a position to congratulate himself, herself, the Government or anyone else with regard to how we care for the homeless for some time.

In response, the Minister advised that aspects of this were important and that we would introduce an amendment in this regard.  Therefore, we are introducing an amendment which specifically provides that a BID proposal may be made available on the Internet.  The amendments I have brought forward provide accordingly and insert the first reference to the Internet in a new subsection, section 129D, thus highlighting the point raised by the Labour Party far more clearly.  In addition, amendment No. 6 provides that where a BID proposal is made available on the Internet, the website address for viewing a copy of the BID proposal must be specified in the public notice inviting submissions on the BID proposal.  I hope this incorporates and enhances the Labour Party proposals.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I indicated to the House on Committee Stage that, if it was considered appropriate, I would bring forward any necessary amendments on Report Stage with regard to the definition of the term "unoccupied" and related terms in sections 4 and 5 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 8 introduces a definition of the term "unoccupied" in the context of the termination of the BID contribution levy under the new section 129N.  Current rating law contains provisions in regard to rate refunds where a property is unoccupied.  Section 129(N) contains a similar provision whereby 50% of the BID contribution levy will apply where a property is unoccupied.  The 50% rate will, therefore, apply where no income is being derived from a property and this is an equitable provision.Amendment No. 8 provides that for a property to qualify as unoccupied, the owner must satisfy the rating authority under three separate tests: first, that the owner is not occupying the property; second, that no other person is entitled to the use or enjoyment of the property; and, third, that the owner is genuinely unable to find a tenant at a reasonable rent.  The owner must satisfy the rating authority under these headings to qualify for the 50% rate on the BID contribution levy.  The wording of the amendments is similar to that used in rating legislation and it is necessary to set these tests out explicitly in the legislation.Amendment No. 9 introduces a similar provision in respect of entry year property and post-entry year property levies.  Amendments Nos. 7, 10 and 11 are consequential amendments to amendments Nos. 8 and 9 and they are required to realign relevant language in the Bill following definition of the term "unoccupied".

Local authorities have failed to establish the ownership of properties in various towns in the past because, for example, when the owner died, his or her relatives were in America and the property lay dormant.  Longford County Council has been unable to establish ownership of a property in one town for the past five years.  Is this covered by the legislation?

The legislation deals with the occupier of the property who is benefiting from it.  If the person is operating a business from the property, he or she will be liable to pay a contribution to the local BID but if the property is unoccupied, such a requirement will not apply, although if the property has been leased, the owner will be liable.  Title and ownership are not at issue in this legislation.

Fine Gael has supported the Bill since its introduction because we have seen how similar legislation has enhanced cities in Europe and the United States.  The concept was developed in New York and it will enable towns, cities and even smaller areas to become more attractive to investors.  BIDs bring great benefit to businesses and communities and they will also be greatly beneficial in attracting industry because the first thing an industrialist considers is the attractiveness of an area.  Our cities and towns will be greatly enhanced and, therefore, I welcome the Bill.

They have been tried elsewhere, especially in the US and Canada, and the success achieved can be translated to our cities and towns in the years ahead.  BIDs have significant positive effects by improving business and enhancing the local communities.  They can also have a positive effect on tourism and employment.  In a number of jurisdictions, there is evidence BIDs have contributed to a reduction in crime, an issue which is never far from our minds.

#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.  The concept of management companies is in dire need of reform and regulation because hundreds of thousands of euro is being collected from householders who have moved into apartment complexes and mixed housing developments.  However, there is no transparency in the collection and expenditure of this money and the bank accounts in which it is held.  I held public meetings in Lusk and Balbriggan in north County Dublin and the information I gathered indicates that a number of management companies can only be contacted through a mobile number which, more often that not, is out of service.  In a number of instances, management companies are not even registered with the Companies Registration Office.  They are flying in the face of their legal corporate governance responsibilities.During a debate in the House last May, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government addressed this issue and whether such companies are acceptable on housing estates.  I accept they are needed in apartment complexes that have common areas such as lifts, stairwells and hallways but people residing on traditional housing estates cannot see the need for them.  Some 500,000 people, 12% of the population, live in apartment complexes with management companies, but the area is not regulated.A further bone of contention is whether this practice is legal.  Will the Government be landed with a bill of unforeseen magnitude and do councils have a legitimate right to impose a planning condition that they cannot enforce?  Normally, a condition in a planning permission is enforceable, for example, landscaping for trees, open spaces and so on.  In this situation, councils are imposing the condition of a management company and are then walking away and saying that the estates are no longer their responsibilities.  However, a planning permission should be enforceable by the authority that grants it.If a test case were taken, local authorities could be held liable in respect of management companies in conventional estates where people have own-door keys, that is, they do not share hall doors or common spaces.  It is wrong that people are forced to pay for public liability insurance and public lighting, that the estates are not taken in charge by councils and that people are left with the long-term responsibility of establishing sinking funds in their communities for roads, open spaces and all other areas over which councils have traditionally had responsibility because they claim that these are privately managed estates.A ridiculous situation has developed.  In Dublin, someone living in a €5 million house could pay no charges for the upkeep of his or her estate because it is taken in charge in terms of public lighting, maintenance, grass cutting and so on in the normal way.  Young couples on the affordable housing list in Fingal, people on lower incomes by the very nature of being on the list, are told when they sign their mortgages, which they get with the assistance of the council, that the estate is managed and that they must supply a cheque for €500 on day one and a cheque for €800 or €1,000 next year.  This situation is ironic, outlandish and needs regulation.  In the first instance, the Minister must instruct local authorities that they must desist from including such conditions in planning permissions.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter and I thank Senator Morrissey for raising it.  As Senators are aware, it was traditional for management companies to operate for apartment developments because it was necessary to have arrangements in place for the upkeep and maintenance of buildings and shared private areas in such developments.Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 recognised the practice of establishing management companies by allowing a planning authority to attach conditions to a planning permission for the maintenance or management of the proposed development.  In early 2006, my Department carried out a survey of planning authorities in response to complaints that they had inappropriately extended the practice of placing the condition of management companies on traditional housing estates.  In response, the authorities indicated that they did not generally do so.My Department subsequently made it plain to planning authorities that conditions requiring management companies should not be attached to planning permissions for traditional housing estates, that is, estates of houses with individual private gardens, except in very specific circumstances, for example, if a particular service or facility is provided for residents' use only, such as a playground.  In January 2006, my Department reminded planning authorities of their responsibilities under the Act in respect of the taking in charge of roads, footpaths, sewerage, etc. in such estates.Many of the residential estates being built are the newer type of high-density estate containing a mix of apartments, duplex houses and other terraced houses, with shared open spaces instead of traditional gardens.  Frequently, these estates contain features such as high-maintenance landscaping and shrubberies, open spaces where interlocking cobbled treatment is used and small playgrounds that would have been intended for residents' use only.Roads, footpaths, public lighting and sewerage should always be taken in charge by the local authority.  However, Senators will acknowledge that some further consideration must be given to whether it is appropriate that all shared areas in high-density estates should be taken in charge and maintained at public expense.  It may be that it is appropriate that some of these facilities should be maintained by the residents themselves.Accordingly, the Department established a working group in August 2006 that is representative of the Department, local authorities, architects, planners and consumer interests.  The group is considering the question of responsibility for the maintenance of various common shared facilities in residential estates, including small landscaped open spaces, car parking and playgrounds.  The group is also considering the issues around completion of estates and the taking-in-charge process having regard to the statutory requirements under section 180 of the Act.  The remit of the group is to develop clear policy advice for planning authorities.Planning authorities have been advised that pending the outcome of the work of the working group, they should only attach planning conditions in respect of the ongoing management of shared facilities in circumstances where they judge that those are clearly required for the benefit of residents.  These circumstances could include apartment blocks, gated communities or where a specific service or facility is provided for residents' use only, such as a private playground.  It is intended to issue guidance to planning authorities by early 2007 at the latest.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Since I tabled this matter last week there has been a considerable change in terms of the Labour Court outcome to the case in question.  Prior to that, the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association hoped for a more positive outcome in terms of their core demand to reduce the working week from 39 hours to 35 hours.  The INO and the PNA will get together to try to formulate a strategic approach to getting their just entitlements and rights within the public service.From working closely with local authorities and other State agencies, the Minister of State knows that only one arm of the public service works a 39-hour week, namely, nurses.  This is a discriminatory practice and it would be wrong to revert the matter to be dealt with by benchmarking.  The Labour Court was in a position to deal with it, but did not do so.  For the Health Service Executive to kick the matter back to touch is the wrong way to go about this business.  In the early 1990s, benchmarking did not work in respect of this issue, anomalies in pay conditions for nursing staff or anomalies in working hours.  I ask the Minister of State to have a serious consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on this matter because the anger within the two organisations is growing.  That anger is justified because of the way they have been treated, but it can be dealt with if we intervene at this stage.  If we kick it to touch and leave benchmarking to deal with the issue, it will not be dealt with.  We procrastinated before and that will happen again.The Minister of State knows from his constituency that most nurses and nursing staff are female and work in arduous conditions with long and anti-social hours which put them under great stress.  There are also males in the sector but the majority are female and it is discriminatory and sexist.  The Government should not take its eye off the ball because their anger is building.  The decision was made last Friday and now it is Wednesday.  There is a meeting next week and I advise the Government to heed the demands of the Psychiatric Nurses Association and the Irish Nurses Organisation.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I thank Senator McHugh for raising what is a very important issue and I am pleased to have the opportunity to answer the question on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the position on the issues raised.Since 1987 the social partnership agreements have helped to maintain a strategic focus on key national priorities and have created and sustained the conditions for employment growth, fiscal stability and the restructuring of the economy to respond to new challenges and opportunities.  There has been a dramatic improvement in living standards and the culture of dialogue has served workers, employers and the people very well.The parties to the previous national agreement, Sustaining Progress , had agreed that the benchmarking exercise was an important initiative in developing a better system of pay determination in the public sector.  The parties further agreed that this process was an appropriate way of determining pay rates in the future.  Following on from this, a new public service benchmarking body, PSBB, was established on 13 January 2006 by the Minister for Finance.  The new PSBB is the mechanism for the determination of the pay of public servants, including nurses and midwives.Members of the Irish Nurses Organisation, INO, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, had accepted pay increases under Sustaining Progress which endorsed benchmarking as the means of addressing claims concerning pay and conditions of employment.  However, the INO and the PNA have since decided not to participate in the current benchmarking process.Prior to the expiry of Sustaining Progress,  the INO and the PNA lodged eight cost-increasing claims with the Health Service Executive employers’ agency for improvements in pay and conditions.  The eight claims were for a pay parity claim with social care and child care workers; a 35-hour week for nurses, without a corresponding reduction in pay; pay parity claim with therapist grades; introduction of a Dublin living allowance; increased shift premium payments; introduction of a preceptorship allowance; a review of clinical nurse specialist and advance nurse practitioner posts; and days lost during the 1999 strike to be reckoned for pension purposes.An initial estimate of the ongoing cost of the claims is more than €800 million per annum and this does not include increased pension costs.  In addition, the unions are seeking retrospection estimated at €566 million.  It is also estimated that in excess of 4,000 additional nurses would be required to make up the shortfall if the working week were to be reduced from 39 to 35 hours.

A Labour Court hearing on the claims was held on 20 June and the court issued its recommendation on 9 November.  It noted that the social partnership agreements continued to have the support of the great majority of workers, their trade unions and employers.  The court also stated that the agreements provided an agreed framework by which workers could obtain improvements in pay and conditions of employment.The court did not recommend concession of any of the major claims made by the two unions.  Instead the court urged the unions to reconsider their position with regard to participation in benchmarking to have their claims examined through that process.The HSE employers' agency has accepted the Labour Court recommendation and has called on the unions to reconsider their attitude to the benchmarking process.  The employers have also urged the INO and the PNA to sign up the current national agreement, Towards 2016.  It should be noted that SIPTU and IMPACT, which represent a minority of nurses, are co-operating with benchmarking and have recently made written and oral submissions to the public service benchmarking body on behalf of their members.  Government policy on cost-increasing claims is clear.  It is not open to public service unions to pursue pay claims otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the prevailing national pay agreement.The Minister values the essential contribution of nurses and midwives to the delivery of a quality health service and she urges the INO and the PNA, in the interests of both patients and staff, to give serious consideration to the court's recommendation.

This is not a like-for-like demand.  I am talking about a woman or a man who has worked in the nursing profession for perhaps 25 or 30 years.  One cannot compare somebody with the skills and expertise of a nurse with a junior doctor just starting his or her career, who may also have to work 39 hours per week.  Looking at different levels is a dangerous road to go down.  The Minister of State knows, as he stated at the end of his response, the value of the contributions nurses make.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	267	This issue has been causing huge concern in Clonakilty in recent times.  Those concerned, the principal, teaching staff, parents and pupils who attend Clonakilty community college, are beyond frustration.  The college was built in 1980 to accommodate 400 pupils.  There are now almost 600 students enrolled there.There is a clear need for an extension to the school.  Much professional advice to that effect has been offered by the Department's experts.  At present, such are the restrictions in terms of capacity at the college that students must walk from one side of Clonakilty to the old technical school on the other side of the town to use spare capacity there.  In February this year I organised a public meeting in Clonakilty in conjunction with people who are affected by the problem in the college.  I have visited the college on a number of occasions and have brought various members of my party to the college when they made constituency visits to highlight the problem, should they or other politicians be in a position in future to do something about it.I walked from the college along the route to the technical school that students are expected to travel.  It is inherently dangerous.  Regardless of the debate about the extension, I must confess that walking that route, which entailed crossing five or six dangerous junctions, is not ideal in terms of safety and the other problems that could arise.  What if a student, for example, were struck by a car?  It could happen on MacCurtain Hill, near the Garda station in Clonakilty, through Assumption Place or crossing the road to the old technical college.The extension is needed now more than ever.  Experts from the Department of Education and Science have examined this issue.  The proposed extension was to be 1,600 sq. m. but in 2001 inspectors from the Department increased it to 1,900 sq. m.  That is how the Department envisages it.  It has been sanctioned since 2001.  In 2002, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, wrote to the local Deputy, who also happened to be the Minister for Agriculture and Food in that Administration, and sanctioned the appointment of the design team.  This was greeted with great fanfare locally.  People were delighted.  However, nothing has happened since.There has been a deafening silence from the Minister about this issue.  There is no way of knowing if the design team will be appointed in days, weeks or months.  The school is constantly expanding and it is not good enough that there is a silence about when the design team will be appointed, particularly given the clear political stunt that was pulled in 2002.  There has never been an explanation from the current Minister as to why the project did not go ahead.There was great expectation locally about the schools listed in the most recent schools building programme; it was expected that Clonakilty community college would feature on it.  Alas, however, there was no mention of the school.  Again, there has been utter silence.  I have been in constant communication with the Department of Education and Science on this issue.  The responses I have received contain all sorts of Civil Service drivel about prioritisation criteria but what does that mean?  How does one go from a situation where the extension is sanctioned in 2002 to nothing happening in 2006?  There has been no communication with the community in Clonakilty about it.Recently, the Taoiseach was in Clonakilty to attend the transfer of Bord Iascaigh Mhara staff to the technology park.  It was a great day for Clonakilty and for decentralisation.  It is part of the decentralisation programme that has worked well and is a most welcome development in the area.  People of Clonakilty welcome the employees of BIM and their families with open arms.  However, if the Government were serious about decentralisation, it would ensure the educational facilities in that area were such that they would attract the employees of BIM and their families.This issue is a cause of great ongoing frustration in Clonakilty.  The Minister could imagine the angst of people if this occurred in his constituency.  There is a deafening silence from the Department despite the raised expectations.  There was a clear pre-election commitment but it has not been fulfilled.  People want to know when this project will go ahead.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I thank Senator McCarthy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the position regarding Clonakilty community college.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office the Government has shown focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.As evidence of this commitment, there will be approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects active in primary and post-primary schools during 2006.  This year, approximately €500 million is being spent on primary and post-primary projects.  The Senator will agree this record level of investment is a lasting testament to the high priority the Government attaches to this sector.There are two schools serving the post-primary needs of Clonakilty — Clonakilty community college, which is co-educational, and Sacred Heart secondary school, which is an all-girls school.  Clonakilty community college was formed in 1980 as a result of the amalgamation of the town's vocational school and St. Mary's boys' secondary school.  It operates under the aegis of County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  The community college was built in 1980 to cater for 400 pupils.  Since then, additional accommodation has been provided to cater for increasing enrolments.Cork VEC requested that the Department of Education and Science review the accommodation at the college and make capital funding available for refurbishment and extension.  This application was processed having regard to all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends in the area and the overall accommodation requirements of the post-primary schools in Clonakilty.  An accommodation brief to cater for a long-term enrolment of 550 has been agreed with the school authorities.  Schedules of accommodation were revised earlier this year to ensure the appropriate level of accommodation is provided to meet the school's long-term needs.  This project is under active consideration in the Department and will be progressed in the context of the schools building and modernisation programme, 2006-10.I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the position with this school project and to highlight the great amount of work being undertaken by the Department of Education and Science in implementing the schools building and modernisation programme to ensure infrastructure of the highest standard is available for all our schoolgoing population.

It has been for many years but we need to know when it will happen.  If that decision were announced, people would be happy.  The project has been already approved and if there were no knowledge deficit, the situation would not be so frustrating.  The project is urgent.  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, for replying.

These concerns have been brought to the attention of the Minister.  She has declared that the project is under active consideration and is part of the 2006-10 building programme.
