Happy New Year to one and all, guests and members. On behalf of the committee, I congratulate Deputy Carroll MacNeill on her appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Finance. It is a very important role. I acknowledge her contribution to this committee and I wish her well in that new role. Hopefully, we will have a replacement soon. We do not have one yet, but I would say we will have one in the next week or two. If attending from within the committee room, I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied this morning by Ms Paula O’Connor, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This morning, we are engaging with officials from the Housing Agency and the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority to examine the following: financial statements 2020 – Housing Agency; financial statements 2021 – Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority; the report of the accounts of public services 2021; and chapter 7 - the Housing Agency revolving acquisition fund. We are joined by the following officials from the Housing Agency: Mr. Bob Jordan, chief executive; Mr. Jim Baneham, director of delivery and innovation; and Ms Claire Feeney, director of services and inclusion. We are also joined by the following officials from the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority: Ms Susanna Lyons, chief executive officer; Mr. Steven Sheridan, head of performance and communications; and Ms Paula Nyland, head of finance and corporate services. We are also joined by officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Mr. Feargal Ó Coigligh and Mr. Roger Harrington, principal officer. You are all very welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to have their mobile phones switched off or on silent mode.  Members will want to note that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage advises that the Housing Agency’s financial statements 2021 are due to be presented to the Government next Tuesday, 24 January. They are expected to be laid before the Houses following that date. We will be examining the 2020 financial statements today. The committee may wish to convene a further meeting to examine the 2021 financial statements.Before I proceed, I want to ask about the following. We are disappointed not to have the 2021 statements here. We are now in 2023. We understand they are coming next Tuesday, but I wish to ask the Department on what date did it receive the agency's 2021 accounts?

There was some design and translation work required to finalise them for presentation. They were submitted to the Minister on 9 January 2023. We have just received them and they are now with the Minister for his consideration.

Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	3	That is correct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	5	We will try to ensure this is not repeated next year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	9	That is fine.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	10	Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Cathaoirleach, to ensure that privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, I may direct witnesses to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative they comply with any such directions. Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	11	As the Chairman said, the Housing Agency's financial statements for 2021 were certified by me on 25 November. As these have not yet been presented to the Oireachtas, I have to confine my comments to the agency's 2020 financial statements. The Housing Agency's statement of income and expenditure is arranged to reflect the agency's three main areas of activity, namely the pyrite remediation scheme; the purchase of housing units mainly through the revolving acquisitions fund; and operational activity. The agency acts on behalf of the pyrite remediation board, managing the pyrite remediation scheme and making payments for remediation work. Funding for the scheme is provided under Vote 34 - Housing, Local Government and Heritage. In 2020, €13 million was provided from the Vote and a further €2.3 million was recovered in settlements with builders and developers. Expenditure on the scheme was €15.5 million. The revolving acquisitions fund was established as part of the action plan for homelessness. In 2020, the Housing Agency had income of just under €30 million from the sale of housing units and spent almost €31 million on the purchase of units. Operational activities of the agency, including administration and employment costs, are predominantly grant funded from Vote 34. In 2020, income for operations totalled €11.1 million. Operational expenditure totalled €10.6 million. A significant portion of the agency's fixed assets comprise plots of building land acquired under the land aggregation scheme. In 2010, 73 sites were approved to transfer to the agency. On 31 December 2020, 65 of these sites continued to be held by the Housing Agency. These were valued at €51 million. I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the agency's 2020 financial statements. The revolving acquisition fund was formally set up on 1 January 2017 for the purposes of acquiring vacant residential units from financial institutions and selling them primarily to approved housing bodies for social housing use. The proceeds from the sales would then be available to be recycled for new purchases. Utilising a fund of over €70 million, the aim was to deliver 1,600 properties by the initial target date of the end of 2020. The target delivery date was later deferred to the end of 2021. The examination found there was a significant shortfall in the delivery of residential units through the fund. By the end of 2021, the agency had completed the acquisition of 868 units, or 54% of the planned number of acquisitions, and had disposed of 735 of the acquired units, mainly through sales to approved housing bodies and local authorities. Initially, the completion of a sale to an approved housing body was considered to represent delivery of a housing unit, however, since 2018 residential units placed on caretaker leases with approved housing bodies have been reported by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in its delivery figures for social housing. While 130 units were held under caretaker agreements at the end of 2021, around 40% of these were in fact vacant at the time. The examination also found that, at the end of 2021, the cash balance of the acquisitions fund was €37.7 million, representing around half of the total fund value. This is indicative of underutilisation of the fund's resources. The Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority was established in February 2021 to oversee the effective governance, financial management and performance of all voluntary and co-operative housing bodies. The authority's first annual financial statements were prepared for the 11-month period ending on 31 December 2021. The authority recorded income for the period in the form of grant funding of €1 million from Vote 34. Gross expenditure by the authority recorded for the period was €1.1 million. The largest expense in the period of account was payroll with the authority employing a total of 19 full-time equivalents at a cost of €672,000. Other significant expenditure includes €132,000 paid to the Housing Agency for a range of support services provided under a service level agreement. During 2022, the authority started to unwind the agreement and to procure the required services from external providers. Again, I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the authority's financial statements for 2021.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	12	I call Mr. Jordan to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	13	I thank the Cathaoirleach and members for the opportunity to present to the Committee of Public Accounts on the 2020 financial statements of the Housing Agency, the agency's revolving acquisitions fund, and the work of the agency. I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Jim Baneham, director of delivery and innovation, and Ms Claire Feeney, director of services and inclusion. The Housing Agency's purpose is to provide expertise and solutions to help deliver sustainable communities throughout Ireland. We do this by being a centre of expertise on housing, supporting housing policy development, and implementing effective housing programmes in collaboration with others. We work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, local authorities and approved housing bodies, in the delivery of housing and housing services. The agency also implements the pyrite remediation scheme on behalf of the Pyrite Resolution Board. To meet the challenges facing our society in respect of housing, the Housing Agency's role and work has increased significantly in recent years. Our work is closely aligned with the Government's national housing strategy, Housing for All. New areas of work include the cost rental equity loan, the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme, the Croí Cónaithe cities scheme, and the management of the land acquisition fund. We will also be playing a role in resolving defects in apartments, which was announced yesterday. Our operational budget for 2023 is €16 million and we currently have 133 staff in the agency. The Housing Agency's acquisitions fund of €70 million was established at the beginning of 2017. The agency's role was to engage with banks and investment funds, in areas of high levels of social housing demand, to acquire vacant residential units for social housing. Separate to the fund, the agency's acquisitions team has acquired properties for local authorities and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to support the delivery of accommodation for international protection applicants. In 2014, the Housing Agency was given responsibility for regulating approved housing bodies under the voluntary regulation code.This role ceased at the end of 2021 following the establishment of an independent authority - the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority, which is here with us today. To facilitate this transition, the Housing Agency provided the agency with administrative support that concluded at the end of 2022. The Housing Agency has a number of priorities. Our first priority is supporting the delivery of more affordable housing. We do this through providing cost-rental equity loans and central underwriting for local authority home loans and facilitating the provision of affordable purchase homes by local authorities. Another priority is increasing the supply of social and private homes. This will be achieved through our technical team to increase supports to local authorities and AHBs. We will be managing the roll-out of the Croí Cónaithe city scheme and are supporting the delivery of the Town Centre First policy to address vacancy and dereliction. We will also be purchasing land for social housing through the land acquisition fund. Our third priority is addressing social inclusion issues, including co-ordinating the delivery of the national Housing First programme to end long-term homelessness, supporting the implementation of the national housing strategy for disabled people and supporting international protection. Regarding the remediation of defective homes, we oversee the delivery of the pyrite remediation scheme. We will be supporting local authorities later this year in the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme and will also be involved in the resolution of defects in apartments. Finally, we contribute to policy development and public discourse by undertaking research. Our research covers three themes - affordability, sustainable communities and social inclusion. For example, we undertake the summary of social housing assessments annually. The Housing Agency is central to the successful delivery of homes and sustainable communities across Ireland. We are committed to ensuring there is financial probity, good governance structures and efficient measures in place to meet the remit and objectives of the agency. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their assistance and courtesy in conducting their work. I thank the committee and the Chairman for their attention and will answer any questions they may have.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	15	I thank the committee for inviting me here today to address it regarding the 2021 audited financial statements of the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority, AHBRA. I am joined by AHBRA's head of communication Mr. Steven Sheridan, and our head of finance and corporate services Ms Paula Nyland. The Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Act 2019 provides for the regulation of AHBs for the purposes of protecting housing assets provided or managed by such bodies. Central to this was the establishment of AHBRA on 1 February 2021. We are funded by the Exchequer from subhead A26 of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Our budget in 2021 was just over €1 million and our total spend was €980,000. Payroll accounted for approximately 66% of our overall spend. Our board comprises nine members appointed in February 2021 following a process conducted by the Public Appointments Service. Our corporate governance arrangements are determined by our legislation, the code of practice for governance of State bodies and an oversight agreement with the Department. We have a number of regulatory functions, including the establishment and maintenance of registration, the setting of standards, encouraging and facilitating better governance, administration, management of AHBs, collecting and publishing information, assessing compliance against the standards and undertaking investigations and enforcement actions as appropriate. AHBs are independent not-for-profit organisations whose purpose includes the provision and management of housing. They play a central role in the Government's Housing for All plan. AHBs report that they own, lease and manage just over 53,000 dwellings. The sector is complex and layered with a large number of AHBs that differ in size, scale, delivery models, funding structures and risk profiles. We have entered a multifaceted regulatory environment. Our powers and functions were commenced on a phased basis throughout 2021 and 2022. One of our initial tasks was the development of our first statement of strategy, which we launched in October 2021. It sets out our vision, mission, values and five strategic objectives. These are captured in members' information packs. We have spent considerable time establishing our organisational structures, policies and procedures and implementing an appropriate governance framework. The current staff complement is 20. Thirteen staff transferred from the Housing Agency and we also commenced a recruitment programme, which remains ongoing.  In 2021, we drafted the standards for AHBs. They cover the areas of governance, financial management and reporting, property and asset management and tenancy management by AHBs. In drafting the standards, we conducted extensive engagement with key stakeholders. In 2021, we launched our website, hosted a series of educational communication webinars and made significant presentations to our key stakeholders.  Initially, the Housing Agency provided a range of services for AHBRA, enabling and supporting our early operations. These administrative services were governed by a service-level agreement and unwound in 2022. In January 2022, 450 AHBs were deemed registered. From this date, we became responsible for registration. We published the register and launched the registration programme. As part of this, there was an initial capture of information, which helped to inform the process. We published the standards for AHBs in February 2022 followed by guidance to support each standard. Our remaining powers and functions were commenced in July 2022 with AHBRA becoming operational. We published our regulatory framework in September. It sets out the framework that AHBs are subject to and outlines our risk-based approach to the sector. We launched our notifiable and general concerns programmes. We launched our annual monitoring programme where AHBs are requested to provide a range of information and data, which we are analysing and evaluating. We will use it to inform our future planned assessment programmes, identify common risks, develop education and guidance programmes and publish sectoral analysis. We introduced a pilot assessment programme that involves a small but diverse set of AHBs. That will allow us to test and evaluate the effectiveness of our process and procedures. Our formal assessment programme will be commenced in the first half of 2023.  We remain at the early stages of our evolution but we have made significant progress in establishing the organisation and putting in place the required regulatory structures but there is more to do. We remain committed to working with all our key stakeholders in delivering effective regulation. I am happy to respond to any questions members may have.

I would second the idea about inviting people back this year. I will focus on the regulator because it is our first interaction with it and it is an area in which I am very interested. I am delighted to see regulation in this area. Given that AHBRA received administrative support from the Housing Agency through to 2022, the Housing Agency might want to come in as well. The introduction period was meant to be completed by November 2022. Are there any outstanding pieces of the legislation that have not been commenced?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	17	No. I can confirm that all pieces of the legislation were commenced from July 2022
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	18	My understanding is that in 2017, there were over 500 AHBs. That number has gone down to 450 at the creation of the register. Could Ms Lyons outline how the initial register was compiled? Did AHBRA send out notification there an existing list that simply rolled over into a register? How did that happen?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	19	The 450 that were deemed registered on 1 January 2022 were on the list of organisations that had received AHB status under section 9 of the miscellaneous Act. They were registered with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Effective from 1 January 2022, they became the responsibility of AHBRA depending on their status.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	23	It is an offence under the Act to act or represent oneself as an AHB. That would enable us to utilise our powers. If someone is behaving and acting as an AHB and representing oneself as same, we have powers.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	29	I thank the Deputy for that important question. Some 450 AHBs were registered with AHBRA in the first instance. Those 450 then had a period of time in which to register with AHBRA to retain their status. It depends on the size of the organisation. One with more than 300 dwellings has 12 months to register to retain its status. By 31 December 2023, it will need to have registered with us and been able to demonstrate that it can meet our eligibility requirements.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	33	Yes. No organisation has yet applied. The organisations have time. As the Deputy will see in our submission or that of the Department, a technical matter relating to eligibility arose. As a result, an extension was given to the timeframes within which organisations could register. The Department has informed us that it is reviewing the technical matter within the eligibility criteria. It is anticipated that amendments will be proposed in 2023.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	35	We are hoping to present amending legislation in the first half of this year through the miscellaneous housing Bill, which will cover a number of issues. The criteria for registration were cast too narrowly, with some unintended consequences. We need to adjust them to facilitate registration.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	36	At the end of my session, I had a question on regulatory capture. We discuss this matter often where housing is concerned. The implication of what the witnesses are saying is that we are already changing regulations or guidelines to suit particular agencies, but is that the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	37	No. The legislation was overly narrow and specific in how the criteria for registration were drafted. They would have excluded-----

For our work in future, how much of the witnesses' collected information is published and available to the public and committees like ours? Going forward, what will that look like?

Based on 2021 numbers, AHBs account for €441 million, or approximately 15%, of the budget. Is that correct? The aim is for that level to reach between 40% and 50%, making AHBs a considerable part of the sector.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	49	Correct.

That is the intention of Housing for All, if we take previous numbers as a guide.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	51	I can only go by the figures that we have and that have been reported. We can see over 53,000 dwellings, an asset base of approximately €7 billion, income of approximately €1.6 billion and liabilities of approximately €5.6 billion in the sector.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	55	There is definitely a debate to be had about the size of the sector in that regard. Our key focus as regulator is on the organisations having the capacity and capability to ensure that people are safe in quality homes, on the organisations being governed correctly and financially viable, on them reinvesting in their properties and other assets, and on them having strong tenant communication policies and procedures.

We often discuss performance indicators and evidence-based decision making. What are the key performance indicators that the Department reports on in respect of each of the AHB funding schemes and how do they feed back into the budgetary process?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	61	There are a number of funding schemes for AHBs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	63	They are the capital assistance scheme, CAS; the cost rental equity loan scheme, CREL; the capital advance leasing facility, CALF; and the provision of affordable housing scheme. I am responsible in the Department for the main scheme, the CALF, which is the main funding source for AHBs in the provision of social housing. Regarding the targets under Housing for All, each local authority area has a target of between 40% and 50% from the AHB sector. In Dublin and Cork, that target is 50% of all social housing delivery. It is 40% in all other local authority areas.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	73	Approximately €65 million.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	75	In the region of nearly €300 million.

When money that is available is not utilised, is there an interrogation of the reason?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	77	There would be. Last year was unique, for example due to the problems arising from the war in Ukraine and its impacts.The rise in construction inflation hampered projects. In terms of what was reported to us by the AHB sector, there was quite a sharp shock in confidence. Also, between the rise in construction inflation of approximately 15% and two interest rate rises by their primarily matching lenders, what happens is under the CALF we give a capital contribution of up to 30% in terms of the capital cost of projects. In the main, the AHB sector then approaches the Housing Finance Agency for the matching 70%. A lot of viability challenges were reported to us in that year because projects that were viable were no longer viable.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	78	Of course and I think that happened throughout the sector. Today is the first time that the delegation is before the committee and, therefore, in some ways, we are setting the groundwork to enable us to continue this conversation. One issue that is immediately obvious is that we can invite the Housing Agency, the authority and the Department in but so much of this matter is bound up with local authorities whom we cannot invite. I would like all three groups present to outline the role that local authorities will have in the oversight of AHBs and their spending and the oversight for the Department in respect of social housing support schemes, and I ask the Housing Agency to list all of its interactions with local authorities. How can we have a joined-up view of what is happening when we cannot extend an invitation to a large part of the State's apparatus? I want to understand the relationships, particularly concerning the regulator and generally. I want to know how we can optimise oversight. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	79	I will begin by advising the committee of the architecture in place. The overall targets as part of Housing for All are given to each local authority and those local authorities have prepared a housing delivery action plan. Within the context of how that works, each local authority has what they call an AHB forum. The AHBs are invited in on a regular basis by the local authority and the local authority discusses with them where they need social and affordable housing, and the timeframe.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	84	The regulator does not have a role specifically relating to local authorities but they will be able to utilise the delivery of our services so they can check against the register, etc. They enter their own contractual arrangements with each AHB and, therefore, they remain responsible for reviewing each of those contracts that they have, including nomination, capital programmes, etc. That is for the individual local authorities. AHBRA then can see the entire spend across the spectrum by local authority, AHB, etc. and that is a valuable tool.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	85	I have run out of time but I wish to flag that there is an obvious issue with the Housing Agency.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	86	The housing delivery action plans are an innovation under Housing for All. In a way what happens in terms of social housing delivery was the local authorities were delivering what they were delivering and only looking over their shoulder to see what AHBs might deliver. Now they are mutually accountable for targets and that is a good thing.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	87	They are not accountable to us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	88	That is true. There is more mutual accountability at local level between local authorities and AHBs. Much more consultation is taking place around delivery, which is a good thing at a local level.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	89	Mr. Harrington mentioned the forums at local authority level and how there is an AHB forum in each local authority. Is it not the case that is only officials who are on them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	90	It is officials from the local authorities, yes. They invite in the various representatives of the AHBs.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	91	It is not members of the local authority and, therefore, there is no strand of accountability to the members at local level once they pass Part 8 applications. Is that correct? There is a flaw because there is no line of accountability at local level. Deputy Hourigan has pointed out that there is no straight line of accountability to us. There is no straight line of accountability to the members who were democratically elected at local level and are, legally, the local council. I draw Mr. Harrington's attention to this issue and perhaps it could be flagged to the Minister.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	92	Certainly.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	93	I thank all the witnesses for making time available this morning. I wish to deal with the Housing Agency's revolving acquisition fund. A target of 1,600 houses within a four-year timeframe was set and slightly over 50% has been achieved. Is there a reason that target was set? I ask because 50% is way off target and I wonder whether there is an explanation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	94	There is. First, the revolving fund was set up to access off-market portfolios of repossessed rental properties by banks and funds. At the point in time that it was set up under Rebuilding Ireland there was quite a lot of that around. In acquiring properties, the role of the Housing Agency was to refer to local authorities to ensure that any properties that we buy or bought would have been in line with social housing need, ensuring that they had good title and there was good value for money for the State. The whole approach to non-performing loans changed over time. At a certain point in time we saw the way the fund was operating and decided to just work with the local authorities on acquiring properties directly on their behalf. Two things were going on. One was a fund but the separate thing was a national housing acquisition team, and that team required a further 582 properties. We were still focused on the 1,600 target. As of today, we have achieved 1,537 but .

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	96	I mean the availability of properties from banks and investment funds dried up.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	97	That is interesting. I deal with banks in a different capacity as a solicitor. In the last few months I have come across two properties that were in possession of banks, which have been vacant for more than ten years. Vulture funds have come along and bought from banks and I do not understand why the State could not have done the same in a far greater capacity. How many properties in total were repossessed by the banks in that five- to eight-year period?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	98	I do not have the figure.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	99	Only 400 in the first two or three years is a small number compared with what was available.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	100	As I said, there were a couple of restrictions on us. First, the local authorities needed to confirm that they wanted these properties for social housing purposes.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	101	It is easy for a local authority to confirm that. One could drop an email to a local authority and ask how many properties can it take on board. The housing list is huge so surely to God the number required could be identified in a timely manner.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	102	I will go into that. To go back a little bit, I was very active on delivering the fund at the time. The banks made lists of properties available to us. They sent substantial lists, which we then disseminated. We would split them up per local authority, and engage with each local authority. In some cases the details on the lists, in terms of identifying the property, was not sufficiently good for them to know exactly what property it was or the properties were unsuitable. Not to make it sound overly easy for the local authorities, they had some work to do. They had to look at issues, say, over saturation for social housing for some of them, etc. Effectively, there was a fairly significant drop-off between the lists. For example, if we sent a list of 50 properties to a local authority, the likelihood was that it would come back with an interest in 25.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	103	I have a question on the sending of a list of 50 properties to a local authority.How long would it take the local authority to respond? I am a bit confused about the time it takes from when a local authority acquires land and gets the building done. Likewise, regarding something like this, why does it take so long for an assessment to be done and to go back to the Housing Agency? What kind of timescale are we talking about? Are we talking about six months, 12 months, 18 months-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	104	No, it would be a lot less than that. The assessment side was relatively quick but it did vary. Sometimes, it was not entirely straightforward. It was very unusual for them to come back the next day, but the following week or perhaps two weeks would be fairly typical.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	105	Yet, more than 400 houses were turned over in the first two years. It seems to have slowed up again after that. Was there a particular reason that by the end of 2021 it was 800 odd houses instead of 1,600 houses? Surely there must be some explanation as to why this was so off target
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	106	There are a couple of technical issues. The biggest issue has probably been the speed of rotation. We anticipated that we could buy properties and then sell them on to an AHB relatively quickly. We thought we could certainly do it in less than a year, but we were kind of optimistic and thought it might take six months. In reality, once we got into the process, it took much longer. There are several reasons that was the case. One of those is that the funding system used by AHBs involves somebody lending them money. The CALF and P and A system involves them getting funding from a lender. These lenders have their own requirements, so-----
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	107	I am sorry; I ask Mr. Baneham to explain about the lenders. I am a bit confused. Where are the lenders coming in? The Housing Agency is talking about acquiring from the banks. It has the funding and it is then transferring on. Why should it run into problems at that stage regarding to whom it is transferring on?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	108	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	110	I will go back a little bit and explain the nature of the arrangement with the AHBs. We had capital money, so it was straightforward for us to buy the houses once there was good title and the local authority was happy for us to buy them, etc. That was the relatively easy bit. When we were selling them, and this was how the fund was rotated, by selling the properties on, mainly to AHBs, those AHBs had to fund that acquisition.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	111	After two years, surely the Housing Agency knew problems were arising and someone should have sat down at the table and asked how the process could be fast tracked? This is about getting housing available to people on housing waiting lists or trying to use up properties that are vacant. As I said, two properties I dealt with in the past three months have been vacant for ten years. We have, therefore, many properties vacant and yet it takes us ages to move them on, even though the funding is available and they have been sorted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	112	There were many meetings and a lot of effort made to try to speed the process up with the AHBs. To try to explain the complexities in that regard, if an AHB had a funding arrangement with a bank, the bank would have a term sheet and it would say that the minimum drawdown from that institution under that facility would be, for instance, €5 million. Individual properties could not be bought from us on that basis. It was necessary to bundle properties together. The banks also insisted that, in some instances anyway, the properties would be fully occupied and repaired.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	113	Regarding the banks, they are being sorted out in the sense that the State is taking properties off them. We are talking about reputable AHBs in this context, so surely to God a mechanism should have been set up with the banks to ensure this process was fast-tracked. The State was sorting out a problem for the banks and getting vacant properties used. In that context, surely there should be a more effective way of dealing with this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	114	We did not have any influence on the banks' lending policies. At least one of them was not an Irish bank, so we had no influence over it. The banks' term sheets and the manner in which they set their terms to lend to AHBs was a matter for them. Additionally, and not to talk only about the banks, it was challenging for the AHBs to deal with properties. Returning to what the Deputy said about the two properties that were vacant for a long time, it would be exceptional for properties to be vacant for that long, in the context of properties to be dealt with. Properties were vacant for long periods, however, and they needed a fair bit of work. There was also a broad range of properties. In taking on a broad range of different properties in different locations with different conditions, AHBs found it a bit more challenging than they would have initially anticipated-----
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	115	I will move on to one final issue concerning residential units that were placed on caretaker leases. Quite a number of them were vacant. Why put a property on a caretaker lease? That is always dangerous because doing so means problems can be run into quickly with that kind of structure.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	116	Again, just to explain the concept of the caretaker lease, we had two options when we started the process. We could have bought the properties and waited to sell them to the AHBs. The Housing Agency, though, is not a housing authority and we do not have big infrastructure that would allow us to maintain and operate properties across the country. We are just not that type of body. The other option was to allow the AHBs, before they bought the properties, to enter those properties and start working on them to make them ready for people to occupy. The purpose of the caretaker lease was to get people moved into properties sooner than if we were waiting ourselves to sell them on.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	118	They were. I think there was a vacancy rate of 40%. Again, it takes time. On a general process basis, it takes time. Once we hand the keys over to an AHB, its representatives visit the property, assess what has to be done, engage a contractor, etc. There is a process there. In some cases, there have been problem properties, and there still are some, where persistent issues have taken some time to address.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	124	There is a commitment under Housing for All to review the fund. That review has taken place. The deadline for that was the first quarter of 2022. Having done that analysis, we came up with a proposal where we would move the fund slightly, trying to use the strengths it has built up in recent years, to set up two streams. One would be around assisting in the work on the town centre first endeavours. The second concerned assisting in terms of Housing First and homelessness. We approached the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to seek a revised sanction for that work. Unfortunately, the Department's view was that those proposals were not sufficiently distinct from several of the funding streams we have and it rejected that approach. We have had continuing conversations with the Department regarding this approach and continued to provide it with information we received throughout 2022, but the Department has maintained its view that it was not satisfactorily distinct enough from the range of funding mechanisms we have centrally and with the local authorities. Accordingly, we are now looking at a proposal that focuses on creating additionality in social housing through the conversion of non-residential and large-scale residential buildings into smaller units. This again speaks to many of the skill sets and experiences we have built up through the operation of the fund and the team that works in the Housing Agency. We have approved this proposal internally and it is currently with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its consideration.

#PaulMcAuliffe	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-party	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-dob	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	126	I might stay with Mr. Baneham regarding the questions Deputy Burke asked concerning the acquisition fund. On the issues relating to local authority vetting or auditing, I was a member of a local authority when that took place. I recall some of the reasons properties were refused. Those included not being wheelchair accessible or not being on the ground floor.I remember Fingal County Council referring to properties in the Finglas area, which is in the council's functional area, but it would have said that its housing demand was, perhaps, for Blanchardstown or Swords. In hindsight, those reasons almost feel like a huge luxury when you look at the housing waiting lists. When Mr. Baneham looks five years on, does he regret not being stronger with some of those local authorities in order that we might have acquired more housing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	127	The relationship with the local authorities is a very important one for the Housing Agency. They are not going to go anywhere so it is important we have good relations with them. While we might have tried to cajole local authorities on occasion in respect of properties, their decisions were the final decisions and that was the end of the matter for us. We never bought a property if a local authority did not want us to buy it.
#PaulMcAuliffe	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-party	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-dob	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	128	In 2017, when there was very clear housing need across the whole spectrum, local authorities were refusing units. I can understand the reasons they might but, as somebody who has people coming to his clinic every single day, they just seem like a luxury. That is a polite term. This seems like such a missed opportunity in that units that were available would have been availed of. I have constituents applying for what are called choice-based lettings, whereby they apply for units where there might be very significant criminal activity in the broader region. We cannot get people to take those houses from the main list and people are still applying for those choice-based lettings because they are so desperate to get housing. In my view, it was a flaw in the process that local authorities could effectively put a block on the purchase of units that often became available then to people other than those on the waiting list. Would Mr. Baneham agree with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	129	I must be careful in that I deal with local authorities every day so I do not want to say anything disparaging about local authorities-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	131	Our role is to support the local authorities in the delivery of their services. At the end they have to sign off on this. The only other thing I will say-----
#PaulMcAuliffe	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-party	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-dob	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	132	Does that continue to be the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	133	I think it does because they are the statutory authorities at the end of the day and they know their local social housing waiting lists. To be fair, they also know the areas where, perhaps, they cannot make allocations or where they do not need housing, so they need to be front and centre. Part of this was to do with the nature of the revolving funds. As I said, we did close to 600 direct acquisitions on behalf of local authorities. It is important to say that a lot of those acquisitions were focused on securing one-bedroom properties and larger properties for people who were homeless or coming out of homelessness to support the Housing First programme, about 300 units in total. To be honest, I do not think the Housing First targets under the Housing First implementation plan would have been achieved without the Housing Agency and the local authorities working very strongly together. I am sure the Deputy knows that one-bedroom properties are like hen's teeth, and we were in a position to go out and secure them. There was therefore a benefit-----

If I may come back to the remaining target, how does the Housing Agency hope to achieve the remaining target and the remaining balance of the funding available to it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	137	Mr. Harrington might want to come in here, but at the moment we are suspended from purchasing properties pending the review. Obviously, the direction of travel at the moment is looking at combining maybe a number of the functions of the agency. We have an advisory service on compulsory purchase orders. We have a technical unit to advise on converting non-residential units into residential units. We hope that this acquisition fund could be deployed then to purchase non-residential units, or larger residential units for conversion into smaller units, to tackle vacancy out there and to support the social housing list. The main benefit of that would be bringing real additionality in respect of the work of the fund.
#PaulMcAuliffe	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-party	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-dob	unknown-#PaulMcAuliffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	138	I do want to move on to the approved housing bodies but, staying with Mr. Jordan, yesterday there was a very significant announcement relating to apartment defects. There is a proposed role for the agency in respect of the administration of the funding. The Construction Defects Alliance, which has done a huge amount of work on that, has very reasonably pointed out that many of the people running owner management companies, OMCs, are volunteers. They are owners who happen to be living in those developments and would not have the procurement, architectural or fire safety skills needed or even the skills to get the whole-building approach that is required now under the proposed legislation. I accept we are a long way from the final detail on this, but would Mr. Jordan accept that for these schemes to be successful it will be important for his agency to be not only resourced but also able to advise those owner management companies, on a broader range, of other defect schemes relating to individual owners?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	139	I think it would be fair to say that there are definitely widely varying capacities within OMCs. To be clear, since 2019, we have been providing training seminars for members of OMCs, people engaged in multi-unit developments, around issues such as sinking funds, service charges and so on but also on governance. At the moment all we know about our own role - obviously, the announcement was just yesterday - is that we have been asked to formalise that into an advisory and support service to OMCs which will be established in quarter 1. We are in the process of establishing that. Beyond that, depending on what the Minister and the Government ask us to do, we may be asked to provide some technical support-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	141	Our resourcing is not the issue. We already have a team there, so that is not the issue and the resources will be available from the Department. We have the expertise and, as I said, we have been working with OMCs for a long time.

I am Vice Chair of the Oireachtas housing committee and we have a line of accountability over what is happening in that area. We are just completing a round of delivery of Housing for All with AHBs and the local authorities and it has been very interesting to see how different local authorities and AHBs have been availing of the new tools that are available for public housing on public land and on private land. This sort of bounces between both the AHB sector and the Housing Agency. How comprehensively are they watching the gearing and the borrowing requirements for AHBs? The AHBs are raising a red flag and saying that some of the requirements around CALF and other funding streams require them to take on borrowing and they are somewhat reluctant to do that. They would prefer more a cash-based or grant-based scheme, so this is about the overall regulation of the financial arrangements and the financial governance but also about delivery. Second, is there an audit or something taking place in the AHB sector to say how many AHBs are availing of all the tools? It is very clear that the new affordable purchase scheme and the affordable rental scheme are things the AHB sector has not really bitten on yet. Some of the local authorities have a long way to go as well. However, those tools are available, they have been legislated for and the funding is there. If AHBs are to be valuable, they must first of all be able to borrow. That is what we want them to do. That is the whole reason to have them; otherwise, we would be doing it ourselves. The second reason would be that they avail of the tools the State provides. Is that being monitored between the Department and the regulator?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	143	I might open up with that before I hand over to the regulator. First, on the question of gearing, yes, we are very conscious of that issue and we have had a lot of interaction with the AHB sector over the past year or so on that. The Housing Alliance has produced a comprehensive report by Savills, which it has forwarded to us. The Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, has also produced a financial roadmap document which it published last October. We have been undertaking a CALF review, and one of the recommendations of that review is that we set up an internal departmental working group to look at the issue of gearing in the AHB sector, which will report in 2023.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	148	Certainly. Deputy McAuliffe asked if all the AHBs are availing of all the tools. Certainly, what we are trying to do, and where I am responsible for CALF, which is the main funding model, is to coax or to persuade AHBs to get more into the delivery of social housing.To give a practical example, later this month, on 26 January, along with the ICSH, we are organising a workshop for smaller AHBs to essentially say to them that these are the range of tools that are available from the State. I will go along to present in terms of the CALF review, outlining the supports we have. The Housing Agency will be there talking about the technical supports and the Housing Finance Agency will also be there. We are basically trying to persuade those smaller AHBs that there is a range of those supports which will enable them to take up a higher level of delivery of social housing.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	150	On the gearing issue, it comes down to concentration risk in regard to growth. I just want to clarify that the gearing matter and leveraging is not a sector-wide issue. It is only for a very small number of AHBs that are demonstrating they are meeting their own headroom in regard to it. We have highlighted historically where in growing by debt and debt alone, you will naturally meet your own headroom in regard to that growth. For a very small number of AHBs, that is absolutely coming to fruition, so there need to be different considerations in that regard, and maybe significant mergers to help leverage their balance sheets better and so on. That is very important. I refer the committee to page 30 of the pack, where we can see that it is only a very small number, whereas the rest of the sector is not wildly leveraged and does not have the same issue. From a regulatory point of view, there is concentration risk from delivery. Those organisations that are delivering are utilising debt and debt alone and, as a result, the natural fruition is that they are going to meet their own capacity.

I would like to talk to Mr. Jordan about one of the flagship Government programmes, Croí Conaithe, which I understand is being administered by the Housing Agency. If I am correct, the basis of the scheme was on the evaluation that the construction cost of an apartment, at around €400,000, which is cited at the moment, would make it unaffordable and, therefore, an €80,000 subsidy would reduce the cost of that. Is that essentially the premise on which it operates?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	153	The premise is the viability gap between the delivery costs of apartments and the cost people are willing to pay on the open market.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	171	I suppose it is a common position between us inasmuch as there have been a number of queries raised in regard to it but, because it is a live process and at this stage there is quite a lot of engagement with people who are still in the process, the figures have not been given out.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	172	To clarify, and this is a point to Mr. Jordan and the Department specifically, this is the Committee of Public Accounts. The Housing Agency is administering a scheme. A member of the Committee of Public Accounts at a hearing is asking Mr. Jordan how many people applied for that scheme. I am not asking for any of the further detail. According to the response we are receiving, the Department and the Housing Agency have together decided that they are not going to divulge that information. Is that the situation as it stands?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	173	The situation is that it is an expression of interest process that we are carrying out on behalf of the Government and it is up to the Government to decide what information is revealed in regard to that, but it is a live process at the moment. We are in a stage 3 appraisal process and we are also awaiting a state aid decision.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	174	The question has been put to Mr. Jordan as the Accounting Officer in the Housing Agency, in regard to a scheme that it is administering, as to how many people applied for that scheme. Mr. Jordan's position is that he is not providing that information.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	175	That is correct.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	176	Why?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	177	Because it is a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to decide when that information will be provided.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	178	So it is a political decision.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	179	I am not saying that. I am just saying it is a matter for the Department.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	180	I asked Mr. Jordan whether the Department had instructed him not to divulge that information because it is very strange. If a local authority is carrying out a scheme which requires expressions of interest, it does not have to seek the approval of the Department in order to say how many expressions were received. It would be considered the most basic of information that is in the public interest. Last May, Mr. Jordan, I presume of his own volition, published an article in a national newspaper. A pertinent paragraph outlined why the Government had launched a new Croí Conaithe Cities scheme aimed at providing 5,000 apartments in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway by 2026 through financially supporting the construction of apartment developments that will have planning permission but are not financially viable. It stated that the Housing Agency would administer the scheme on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. To any objective observer, that was very much the stamp of approval by the Housing Agency on that scheme, which was aimed at providing 5,000 apartments in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. The Housing Agency had an expressions of interest scheme. It is in the public interest to know whether the level of expressions of interest would allow for the delivery of those and Mr. Jordan is not providing that information. I do not think it is acceptable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	181	I understand what the Deputy is saying. What we can say is that there has been significant interest in the scheme.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	182	There has been significant interest. Okay. We will try to move on. In terms of the significant interest, has there been a regional breakdown or disparity between the areas that Mr. Jordan cited in his article, namely, Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway? Have there been expressions of interest from all of those areas, for example?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	183	I can confirm that, at the outset, there was an application in regard to all five of the national planning framework cities. That was the case at the start, yes.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	184	I take it from that language that some of those expressions of interest have since receded or are no longer in the-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	185	Again, I can broadly describe a process. Some of them were not eligible. Some of them have basically dropped off further along the process for other reasons, but some of them were not eligible. I can give a simple example of why they might not be eligible. Some of them at the point of submission did not have planning, and that was a requirement.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	186	How many cases did that relate to?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	187	There was definitely one that did not have planning. There were also submissions built around schemes.They cannot be sold individually so they are not eligible. There were at least two of those.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	188	If all of the remaining applications, if I can use that term, were to reach fruition, how many apartments would be delivered?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	189	Again, I cannot be specific but, to give some context, it is clear from the review of Housing for All that there is to be a second call, so it is fairly logical to assume that we are not in a position to guarantee the delivery of 5,000 from the first call.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	190	I presume state aid approval has not been granted. From that and from Mr. Baneham's reticence to give information, I take it that no application has actually been approved as of yet. Is that fair to say?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	191	No, we cannot approve applications.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	192	I take it that Mr. Baneham also cannot or will not provide a breakdown of approvals by local authority area or project size. We will have to follow up on this matter and use our authority to insist on that information being provided. This is a flagship programme. In every debate on housing I listen to, a Government spokesperson tells us that this is going to be a key scheme. One of the things we know is that, since the launch last year, there has been significant inflation in construction costs. At the much-vaunted housing seminar called by the Taoiseach in recent weeks, a number of developers were requesting increased subsidies. Has there been any engagement with those who have previously made expressions of interest who are now seeking additional funding under this scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	193	There is an ongoing process with the developers who are in the scheme. Increased funding has been raised as a proposal from their side. At the moment, however, there is no change. The parameters of the scheme are totally unchanged.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	194	We are told that, at the summit, representatives of a number of developers were indicating that they wanted an increased level of subsidy. I take it the Housing Agency was represented at that seminar.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	195	We were.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	197	No. Specific figures were not mentioned but the issue of viability came up quite a bit.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	200	The witnesses are very welcome. I will primarily focus on the enhanced long-term leasing of social housing. Obviously, value for money is a critical issue. We have to be prudent to get more for the money we have. The Housing Agency has a responsibility to deal with the local authorities in respect of leasing, which we were told was going to be phased out. Do we know how many leases are in place and the average cost per annum?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	201	We do not have that information because the leases are signed with the local authorities. We are aware that-----
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	202	I have very limited time. This is really important. I have found it really difficult to get this information. I would nearly have to write to each local authority. This is madness. My local authority has 2,250 leases. The information given in response to a parliamentary question a year and a half ago was that the average cost was €17,000 per annum. Doing my calculations on the basis of that, I see that the 2,250 leases in Kildare would cost €38 million a year. Over the typical 25-year lease, that works out to be almost €1 billion. There is no asset at the end. The house is refurbished and handed back at the end. We do not know where the tenants go but provision must obviously be made for them. That is incredibly bad value for money. In an article in 2021, someone I am not used to quoting, Mr. Dermot Desmond, said that this was a "criminal waste of money" and that investment funds were having a laugh at Ireland's expense. We all know we need housing. We need social housing, affordable housing, housing for sale and housing for rent. However, value for money is critical. The Housing Agency is carrying out a review. I believe it is into Part V provision. Do local authorities have the authority to buy Part V housing? Are they required to take the option of leasing Part V housing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	203	With regard to Part V, the default position is that local authorities are supposed to try to buy the units. There are instances in the build-to-rent sector, for example, where they may not be able to and must enter a long-term lease. However, in the main, the properties are bought. That is what the Department encourages local authorities to do.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	204	The Minister said that he was going to bring in legislation to exclude Part V units. Has that happened?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	205	No, not that I am aware of.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	207	I believe any leasing under Part V is very limited.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	209	Yes.

Ms Feeney said that it is carried out by individual local authorities. The Housing Agency has a role in this. Why would it not have overall statistics through which to look at this issue, the value for money achieved and how this is applied in each local authority? I am finding it really difficult to get comprehensive figures. It is absolutely essential that we get comprehensive figures and such an overview if this is a "criminal waste of money".
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	211	The Deputy is correct that this is being phased out but, for the enhanced leases or any other leasing proposal with a cost of over €20 million, we do a cost analysis for the Department. We compare the cost of the leases over the term with the housing assistance payment, HAP, direct build or any other approach. In many cases, the cost provisions in the recommendations are constrained by the fact that the units are only available for leasing. However, we do carry out a cost analysis for the Department.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	215	I am not aware of the number of planning permissions there are for build-to-rent developments.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	219	Yes. It compares the arrangement with acquisitions, local authority new builds on similar sites and so on.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	221	It may not be a better option but the only option for the units.

The Housing Agency may go back to a local authority with a cost-benefit analysis but, if it does not have the option to buy, it is not really looking at that option.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	227	We have compared it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	231	It would probably come down to the Department requesting us to do the work.

I am aware that there is an intention to carry out such an analysis. We have been told that the scheme going to be phased out. When I started raising this matter with the Taoiseach in the Dáil a couple of years ago - I thought he was taken aback by what the scheme involved - I was told that it was going to be phased out. I was also told that the Government was not going to be on both sides of the fence whereby it would be leasing properties and local authorities would be providing tenants. Incidentally, people get paid for long leases regardless of whether the houses involved are occupied. The position is very certain. It is like winning the lottery because the numbers are known in advance. What is the Department doing to ensure that there is value for money in terms of reviews? Why is there an absence of global information in respect of this matter?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	233	In the context of today's agenda, neither Mr. Harrington nor I deal with this issue within the Department. I am sure the relevant officials would be happy to come back some other day to discuss these issues with the committee.

The Department is not going to have stock at the end of this. I ask that the officials come back with a comprehensive report. Answers are also required in respect of a number of questions. How many leases are or were in place and what is the average cost involved? Replies to parliamentary questions indicate that the information involved is commercially sensitive on an individual basis. Perhaps the Department could outline the average cost per county. When will the scheme will be phased out? Why has not been phased out to date? How can the Department conduct a cost-benefit analysis in circumstances where something is not for sale? How does the build-to-rent aspect work in the context of Part V housing? We need to have oversight of all that. If we are going to assess whether there has been value for money, we need that information. It is very hard to see how anyone could say that there is value for money when it comes to enhanced leases.

I also thank them for their work within the relevant Departments. I will start with the Housing Agency's remit to deliver a workable pyrite remediation scheme. I am interested to hear about the agency's involvement in the roll-out of the scheme.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	243	We roll out the pyrite remediation scheme on behalf of the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB. We have been doing this since February 2014. We do the full solution in terms of carrying out the remediation of properties accepted into the scheme. We co-ordinate the testing of dwellings and recommend the inclusion of dwellings within the scheme. We then enter into agreements with each scheme participant and get contractors to do the work. In terms of figures, we have just surpassed the 2,500 remediations mark. Over the past couple of years, the cost of remediation has increased, mainly due to construction inflation, from about €65,000 on average per unit to about €90,000 today. We would regard the pyrite remediation scheme as being in its mature phase in the sense that the number of applications is going down and the number of remediations that we have to do is also falling. I can give the Deputy some figures on the scheme. In 2020 and 2021, 201 properties were remediated. Last year the figure was 235 and we have a target of 260 dwellings to remediate this year.  The other point to make is that we are very conscious of the impact of pyrite on homeowners. Indeed, that is a theme this week in the context of defects. The PRB conducts an annual survey of people who have had their properties remediated and the overall satisfaction rate for the scheme and the Housing Agency's involvement in it is over 85%. The current figure is actually 87%.

Since the scheme's establishment, we have remediated over 2,500 dwellings.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	245	Yes, 2,500 properties have been remediated and approximately 3,200 applications have been made to date. There are nine local authority areas within the scheme and the total spend as of the end of 2022 was about €170 million. The estimated 10,000 properties have not materialised.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	246	On the extension of the scheme to other local authorities, I see that Westmeath has now been brought in. I ask Mr. Jordan to provide some detail on that and to outline any future plans to extend the scheme to other local authority areas.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	247	Decisions on any extension of the scheme are a matter for the PRB. We conduct the pyrite remediation scheme on behalf of the board and any extension of it would be a matter for the PRB.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	249	Yes, and that includes VAT.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	250	How has that affected the annual budget allocation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	251	To be fair, the budget has remained fairly static at around €20 million per year. It is estimated that it will be about €25 million in 2023 but an increased number of properties will be included in the scheme this year. The budget is fairly stable.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	252	What has the Housing Agency learned from the roll-out of the scheme? Have there been any learnings from the agency's engagement with homeowners, local authorities and the contractors on the execution of the scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	253	The main learning from the scheme has been that the contractors have got very efficient at doing housing in estates and can now do the work in a short period of time. They have learned how to implement the scheme.Maybe the bigger learning from the pyrite remediation scheme is that we are now taking on a role in the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Some of the staff who have been involved in delivering the pyrite remediation scheme will bring and are bringing that skill set to that scheme. Obviously, if the agency has a significant role in relation to apartment defects, those skills will be brought forward. I suppose the agency has developed an expertise in this area of remediation and the resolution of defects.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	254	I will ask about the agency's staffing because the roll-out of the enhanced defective blocks remediation scheme will be enormous. What type of resources are required to work with local authorities? Is the Housing Agency taking responsibility away from local authorities in delivery for homeowners who gain approval to enter the scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	255	Under the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme, the homeowner applies to the local authority. The local authorities remain out front. Our job will be to act as agents of the local authorities in the assessment of applications to ensure that they meet the damage threshold, sampling and testing the homes, determining the appropriate remediation option, and recommending the maximum grant amount to the local authority, which will then inform the homeowner of the amount of the grant. On the logistics of it, we now have a regional office in County Donegal, which is equidistant between the Inishowen Peninsula-----
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	256	Is it in County Mayo?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	257	-----and County Mayo. It is equidistant. We are trying to cover both areas through that office. Counties Clare and Limerick will also be coming into the scheme. We have a lot of interaction with local authorities around that. At the moment, we are at the stage where regulations are being prepared by the Department. We are working with the Department on our role in respect of those specific regulations. We have done a tendering process to get consulting engineers ready to go. Essentially, the agency is ready to take up our role in this scheme, once the green light is pressed for the introduction of regulations.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	258	Will the Housing Agency support homeowners in the acquisition of contractors to do remediation works?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	259	No, we will not. Our role really ceases once we have made a recommendation to the local authority of the maximum grant amount. Beyond that, individual homeowners will have to get their own engineers to do the work.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	260	Will the Housing Agency review the cost analysis in respect of building inflation for the initial scheme? As was mentioned, costs for the pyrite remediation scheme have increased from €67,000 to €90,000, which is an increase of nearly 30%.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	261	The rates and the amount of money people will get is a matter for the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI. It is my understanding the society is doing that at the moment.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	262	I will ask departmental officials about the roll-out of the scheme. How confident are they in local authorities regarding the delivery of this scheme? To take Mayo and Donegal county councils, what has been the officials' engagement to date in respect of the accessibility to homeowners of the new, enhanced scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	263	Again, this is another topic that does not come under the remit of my responsibility or that of Mr. Harrington's, within the Department. The Department is working on regulations to give effect to the scheme. It has put a lot of effort and resources into that to try to address all the issues. If there are any specific questions, we can come back to the Deputy.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	264	As departmental officials are here, I will ask whether they have oversight of the pyrite remediation scheme.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	265	I have oversight of the pyrite remediation scheme but not, as it happens, the concrete blocks scheme.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	266	My time is limited. I will move on to the land aggregation scheme. How many units does the Housing Agency estimate it will deliver on existing sites at present? Will its representatives provide an overview regarding its work in this area?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	267	I will give an update on that. The land aggregation scheme involved the transfer of 73 sites at the outset of the process. At the moment, we have transferred 13 of those either to local authorities or AHBs. There are also some school transfers to the Department of Education. To date, 676 dwellings have been built on lands that were land aggregation lands. A small number - I think it is only 18 - are currently on site, but planning has been granted for a further 444 and another 1,300 or so are in the planning process. Quite a large chunk of that is with the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the strategic housing delivery planning system. There is bit of delay on that but, taking it altogether, we are looking at approximately 2,500 dwellings at present in terms of delivery that has already occurred, what is in the pipeline and what is planned. There is probably capacity for further houses beyond that as well.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	268	On the allocation of those houses, how does the Housing Agency work with local authorities in assigning those houses to individuals?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	269	There is particular LDA legislation which obviously impacts certain sites but the first port of call is with local authorities to see whether they want to use the site. They always get the first dibs on it. After that, we engage with AHBs, if they are amenable. We have had a couple of processes with AHBs where we have gone out and looked for expressions of interest. Once a scheme is built and is ready to be allocated, that is entirely a matter for the local authority.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	270	I will touch on AHBs. If smaller AHBs look to wind down and given that State funding or backing has been provided, what regulatory oversight does the AHBRA have, once the loans are repaid in full, particularly if the AHB is not looking to deliver additional housing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	271	If an AHB is seeking to wind down and cancel its regulation with AHBRA, we will seek clarification on what will happen with the assets and what is the current status of those assets, in addition to what will happen with the tenants and whether the assets are being transferred to another AHB. Additionally, we will seek representation from the local authorities to make sure that any liabilities associated, and any contractual arrangements, have been fully covered and that they are satisfied with such. That is the formal side of it but from a mergers and stock transfers perspective, because there are some interests in this AHBRA will release information and guidance relating to best practice for winding down, mergers and the type of things the board should consider.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	272	Generally speaking, what does AHBRA find happens to the assets?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	273	From what we have seen so far, and it has been quite small, assets are predominantly transferring and remaining within the AHB sector.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	274	With the trustees of the board. Is that the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	275	They are transferring the housing assets to another AHB.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	276	To give an example, it would go from, say, Respond to-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	277	Exactly. It would go from a small AHB. The Peter McVerry Trust is probably a good example. It has taken over the management of a number of smaller AHBs, which have merged successfully within the Peter McVerry Trust.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	278	On building up the total housing stock throughout the State, would it not make more sense for the State to take out an equity stake rather than providing loans? We would then be building up the housing stock. Would that not make more sense?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	279	That is a matter of policy. The regulator is here to evaluate the AHBs, to understand the financial structures etc.At this time what we are seeing is that growth is utilising the capital advanced leasing facility, CALF, and loan financing and any growth is debt financing. Historically, if we look at the base, about 51% would have been the capital assistance scheme, CAS, and the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS, but now we see that the CALF and debt funding are starting to take over from that. However, whether that is equity is probably more a matter for the Department.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	280	Has any consideration been given to that or has any research been commissioned?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	281	This is an issue that has arisen in the context of the CALF review and in terms of the wider debate that is going on in the approved housing bodies, AHB, sector, as we discussed, regarding the levels of gearing. We have very recently completed the CALF review and it has been approved by the Minister. It is currently on its way to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its sanction. One of the recommendations is to establish an internal departmental working group to look at the issue of gearing. In terms of potential solutions to that issue, we will be looking at the equity stake idea.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	282	I did not catch all of the meeting but what struck me most of all from the first questioner, Deputy Hourigan, right through was the phrases "we are currently looking into that" and "we are looking to establish this". We are in the depths of a housing emergency and whether it is delays or the revolving acquisition fund or whatever questions the witnesses were asked, the answer was always that the matter was being looked at. We are in the depths of a housing emergency and things are just being looked at and faults identified in the various schemes and processes have just been allowed run. I question the witnesses' grasp of how desperate it is out there when things are allowed to sit and slide without immediate attention being given to them. Things that could be rectified fairly swiftly to ensure the smooth delivery of homes to people have not been done.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	283	In my area of responsibility on the CALF side, which is one of the major programmes for funding AHBs, when we hit situations where those particular financial models do not work as well as they could or they run into issues, as they did last year with construction inflation and the challenges to viability from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA interest rate, while it might be frustrating, in order to go forward, it is a necessity for us and we have to, in a sense, stop, do a review, consider the position and then move on with an improved system that will deliver more housing in more local authority areas under the CALF scheme.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	284	Mr. Harrington would accept that the evidence suggests there is a lack of expediency. The process is so drawn out. We hear from approved housing bodies how long it takes for departmental approval. They go through the Housing Agency in a relatively short time and then they have to duplicate that work which can take anything up to six months. The cost of construction is rising, so things are costing more in the long run because of that delay. Is it something the Housing Agency is aware of as an issue? Mr. Harrington mentioned going through a process, but when AHBs are saying that there is undue delay and it is coming from the Department, that is something that could be simplified, I am sure.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	285	I am not aware what specific scheme the AHBs Deputy Munster may have been talking to are referring to. With the one I have responsibility for in CALF, we turn around, with the assistance of the Housing Agency, all applications within a maximum of six weeks. Indeed, the majority of our applications are turned around within four weeks. On occasion, where we have to react to urgent applications from the AHB sector that are moving to meet the credit committee deadlines of the Housing Finance Agency, we turn them around in 24 hours. I do not know if there is any further comment the Housing Agency might want to make, but certainly it is a pretty speedy process in terms of the CALF application process.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	286	I have just pointed out to Mr. Harrington that approved housing bodies have flagged that there is undue delay, that there is a reasonable turnaround with the Housing Agency, but then it goes to the Department and the whole rigmarole has to be gone through again and everything duplicated, leading to increased construction costs. This is all totally unnecessary in the midst of a housing emergency. It beggars belief.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	287	It may not be the CALF funding mechanism. I suspect it may be the other mechanisms. The turnaround time on CALF is very good. We do it within two weeks within the agency. I can provide the figures for last year. We appraised 241 projects with the potential to generate 5,000 homes through the approved housing bodies. They were all turned around very quickly. The appraisals are done on behalf of the Department, so there is not a follow on.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	288	We do a specific technical appraisal. It is a financial analysis of the proposal in relation to assessing how much CALF is required etc. It is a separate process which fits into the overall process of the Department. There is not really a duplication.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	289	They are not saying that because they are bored. They are saying it out of frustration.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	290	What the Deputy might be referring to is a particular situation we had in 2022 where, because of the two HFA interest rates, it may have been necessary for certain AHBs to get re-approved because the financial circumstances had changed as a result of the HFA interest rate rise. This issue has not been raised in the consultation we have done and in our fairly regular meetings with the AHB sector. We are looking at a situation, and we hope to implement it relatively quickly in quarter 1 of this year, where the approval will reflect, in terms of the CALF and the payment and availability amount, what might happen if the HFA were to increase its interest rates. It would negate the need for the AHBs to come back to us and for us to go back to the Housing Agency to get a re-approval process. That should short-circuit that particular process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	292	There are 450 AHBs registered with AHBRA.

Is AHBRA fully responsible for the governance of the AHBs or are they individually responsible as commercial entities? How does that work?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	298	The regulator has implemented a set of standards relating to the governance, financial management, reporting, asset and property management and tenancy management of AHBs. They are independent legal entities in the main. That is our regulatory framework. We also manage the registration of AHBs, so those that are currently deemed and any new organisations that may wish to register as an AHB would do so with the new authority.

Across the board there is €5.6 billion of liabilities for those organisations. That can be split into grants to the sector, which are just shy of €1.5 billion, and loan financing, which is €3.6 billion. Loan financing is comprised of CALF and HFA funding. I can give the Deputy any further split he requires after the meeting.

Will the Housing Agency give an update on the development of each of the eight sites Mr. Baneham referred to that were transferred to the land aggregation scheme at the end of 2020?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	313	The Deputy mentioned a certain number of sites.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	315	Perhaps it was LDA sites rather than eight sites.

Can anyone speak about those sites that were transferred to the LDA or is that outside the witnesses' remit?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	317	I will speak about them. There are three sites. They have yet to transfer to the LDA. One is in Naas - it is close to the local authority offices in Devoy Barracks - another is in Skerries and the last one is in Balbriggan. The site in Naas has planning approval for 219 dwellings. Planning applications were submitted for the other two well before Christmas and a decision is awaited. The one in Skerries is for 344 dwellings and the other is for 811 dwellings in Balbriggan. I do not want to misquote them, but they are hoping to start on site before the end of quarter 2 in Naas.

Have any been transferred at this point?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	319	We started with 73 sites. Perhaps the 65 the Deputy refers to is from our 2020 report. We still had 65 then. We are down to 60 as of the end of last year. The other matter to be mindful of is that we sometimes transfer a portion of a site. We would still count it as a site we own but we own less of it, so there has been more activity and there have been more transfers than might be obvious from the movement from 73 to 60. As noted, we first consult local authorities to see what their intentions are for sites and, subject to them being happy with us going to the AHB sector, we engage with AHBs.

In some cases they have been 100% financed, while in others it has been 90% or 30% and the AHBs go to the Housing Finance Agency to borrow the rest. When the AHB is out the other end, as it were, and the finance has been redeemed after 25 or 30 years, why is the State not taking an equity share in those developments? Will Mr. Jordan explain the agency's thinking on that as it seems it is losing an asset?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	322	Does the Chair mean that the asset reverts in the end?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	323	Where does it revert to? I have looked at the briefings for today's meeting and read about the five different schemes, and I am not clear about what happens at the end. If the State has equity in a scheme, it has control of the asset. The reason I ask the question is because some of the earlier and especially smaller AHBs that started in the 1990s are now coming out the other end of it, so to speak. A small one I am aware of is in a situation where allocations have never come through the local authority and it built, possibly, as far as I can ascertain, and there will be clarification from the Department and the local authority on this, with 100% finance. There is no regard to rent. No allocations are coming through the local authority. A private company is now running the show. The only interface the tenants, who are vulnerable, have with anyone is with a private company. Some were handed forms recently to go to the social welfare office and claim rent supplement to pay higher rents, and to cap it all off, new tenants coming in for a considerable period of time are paying hello money of up to €10,000. Let me be clear. In the main, the AHBs play a valuable role. They are very good. We will accept that some are better than others. In our neck of the woods we have been lucky with some good ones. Certainly, we have found that some of the bigger ones provide good quality housing, good tenant liaison, fair rents and so on. The sector is good.However, I am concerned about vulnerable tenants. The first thing that is going wrong is that the allocations are not coming through the local authority, which assesses housing needs. That is the gate people come through, is that correct? Now, rents can be increased. Recently, there was a situation where a manager, who perhaps would have handled it on behalf of a voluntary board, is now supplanted by a private management company that notifies residents that their rents will increase by perhaps 60%. There is a situation with that. Some people have been handed forms to go down and claim rent supplement. I also raise the question of hello money. Can Ms Feeney deal with that for me?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	324	It is a very unusual situation. The first thing-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	326	The allocations normally depend on the funding. With all of the current schemes, because the funding is coming through the local authority, the local authority has 100% allocation rights. There was a time where if something was delivered through, say, fundraising, the local authority would not have had any say regarding the allocation. In addition, there was a period where, depending on the type of capital assistance scheme, it could be a ratio of 75:25.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	327	That is correct.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	328	However, vulnerable tenants need to be protected. If the Chair wants us to have a look at that particular incident separately, we would. Under the housing strategy for disabled people; I have that under my remit and I would be very concerned about-----
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	329	I am asking a very direct question regarding the point where the loan is redeemed or where there is no longer that financial connection. Let us say the 25 or 30 years are up. Can this situation arise? How has this situation arisen? I read that it is most likely a capital assistance scheme coming from the 1990s. It states here that the rent should be an economic rent and tenants are taken off the local authority housing waiting list. Can somebody in the agency or the Department confirm whether that should still be the case, even when they are out of the period of financing? However, the AHB has a 25% nomination right if it offers 95% CAS funding, which could be the case. There is an active search for the paperwork on this at the moment. At the very least, the local authority should have 75%. Do they have that when they are out of the financing period?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	330	No, unless the organisation enters into a further payment. That is actually something that is active-----
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	331	To clarify, does that mean that they can allocate to whomever they want?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	332	The problem is that after the 25 years with CAS, there is no lien on the property with regard to the mortgage. Albeit it is an AHB and is providing, and its purpose is to provide social housing, there is no control regarding the allocation, to be honest.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	333	So they can do what they like. Here we have houses built with taxpayers’ money and land donated by an institution – and thanks to them for that. It was a very positive thing at the time and a very good use of a piece of land. Houses were built by the taxpayer and the taxpayer is now subsidising the rents for these. The vulnerable tenants are left in a situation where the only interface they have is with this private company.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	334	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	336	Yes, I would agree.

As the Committee of Public Accounts, there is the whole thing about value for money. We are losing. One of the Deputies already referred to this matter briefly. Could these situations arise? Here is an example of where it has arisen. We are losing housing stock. It is a small enough one at fewer than three dozen. I do not want to be too specific about it. It is fewer than three dozen. There is at least one that I am aware of and possibly a second. There is a situation where that social housing is now lost. For example, a vulnerable tenant living in a caravan – a pensioner – who does not have the €10,000 and is most in need of single-storey accommodation in that area does not have a hope of getting in the door, potentially, if situations like this start arising around the country. Somebody who has €10,000 in hello money is straight in the door. The management is now done by a private company. This is bizarre. We are now in a situation where social housing is now in the possession and control of a private company. The State – the taxpayer – finances it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	338	Is the ownership still with the approved housing body?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	339	Yes. However, the main interface, and the only interface that some have had, is with a private company. That is the point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	340	It is up to anyone to raise a concern with AHBRA. From what the Chair has outlined, it may be beneficial to raise a concern with us, which will enable us to do a full screening of the circumstances outlined. That would be a good use of the regulator.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	341	I welcome the fact that there is a regulator in place. From the point of view of value for public money, the reason we have social housing is to meet the social housing need for those who cannot provide a house. The group I am talking about is elderly people – the most vulnerable – and some of them have special needs. Yet, we find ourselves in this situation. The concern is that if this starts happening across the State, what power does the State have? Is the State completely rudderless? Are the hands of the Government, the Department, the Housing Agency and the regulator tied behind their backs and all we can do is stand on the sidelines, look at it and say “Is this not terrible?”
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	342	A concern could be raised with us if the organisation that the Chair is referring to is a registered approved housing body. What he has demonstrated does not appear to be correct in relation to governance, financial management and property and asset management. Second, 95% of AHB organisations are charities, so there is a charitable purpose. Organisations’ constitutions will clearly lay out that they are in the provision and delivery of housing for those in need. Use of the term “hello money” etc. would not necessarily demonstrate that. Within our concerns policy, anybody – any member of the public – can raise a concern with us and it may be a good idea to do that in that particular circumstance.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	343	The provision of these units was very positive. They met the housing needs of an awful lot of people, some of whom were elderly and, unfortunately, have passed on over the past 20 or 30 years. The intentions of the body itself were positive and good. The people on the small approved housing body did good work and had good intentions. However, typically, people move on and people are getting older. They then find that their capacity to manage it has changed, they decide to bring in a private company and here we go. That is the situation. I think there will be a bit more on this one and there could be another one along with it as well. I will allow members back in for a second round of questions.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	344	I want to stick with that issue. For clarity, taking out the particular instance the Chair has provided, at the end of any kind of financial lien with an AHB, the AHB has full control over the asset and there is no allocation rights from the local authority. Is that correct? Okay. We can have a long conversation about value for money in terms of the State and having absolutely no allocation rights in perpetuity. However, just to be clear, regarding the briefings we received, much of the discussion around the AHB model is that you can work with local authorities to fulfil national policy on things such as disability provision, the provision of elder housing and all of those good things. The issue of the AHB being a charity or non-profit is neither here nor there.The issue is not profit; it is that they will be under no requirement to work with the local authorities to fulfil those quotas. The housing units will be there but the AHB can operate completely independently from the local authority at that stage because there is no lien on the property. I would just flag the fact that does not make any sense. I want to be clear on a few other things. These questions are for Ms Lyons. Are there any investigations currently being undertaken by the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority? Has it launched any investigations yet? I know the authority is in early its stages.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	345	No, we have not launched any investigations yet.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	347	Yes, we received eight concerns in 2022. We have what we call a notifiable events programme and we have received 89 notifiable events, which inform us of changes in governance, potential transfer of assets etc. It is a fairly comprehensive programme.

Any concern that is raised with the regulator is screened. We then review that against our remit. It may be that that concern may be best dealt with by another regulator. Then we do a risk evaluation on it and then we review. We may close it and not ask for any further information. We may proceed to ask for additional information or we may proceed to bring it into our regulatory framework, that is, have a planned assessment or reactive assessment.

It should at least have that as a guideline. Obviously if a tenant is experiencing something distressing or difficult, not having a timeframe is problematic. We have talked a little today about registering AHBs that are currently in that process. During 2021-22, were there any AHBs that received funding from the Department that would not have been registered, whose registration was pending or were not fully registered?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	355	I am not aware of any funding in that regard. There was a transition between the interim regulatory system and the fully legislative-based system. To receive funding under either system, organisations had to be registered.

My experience with the larger ones is that they are professionally managed, whereas the smaller ones are usually run by volunteers and can be vastly different. That is where I have seen difficulties with getting insurance and not being in compliance with things and causing all sorts of problems. Some of those issues have been resolved. My understanding is that for a lot of these, it was capital assistance and then there was an annual maintenance amount provided so as to keep the stock up to standard. Am I right on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	363	On payment and availability, the Deputy is right.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	365	No, it does not. It is for the term of the loan.

What happens to those assets? Once they do not have a loan they will get rents. They may well have people, if they have a differential rent for example, who are paying the maximum of that and if they have been using that maintenance grant wisely the housing stock will be in good condition so they may well not have to reinvest it in those houses. What happens to those assets? Do we know?

Any operational funds that are given are based on what is projected as being needed to keep the property and would take the rent off.

It could be an economic rent. Under the CAS funding, it is an economic rent and under the others, it is a differential rent. I will check that for the Deputy and come back to her.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	373	It is cross-section. We have some on the larger side. It is predominantly smaller AHBs but it is probably about 50:50.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	375	No, we have that ability. We monitor all 450. We have just rolled that out. We can assess an organisation specifically against the standards. We will roll out a planned assessment programme throughout 2023 and we will choose those AHBs based on their size, scale, risk profile, any information we may get in, concerns, any adverse media or any notifiable events. We take a multiple of things that allow us to evaluate who needs to be assessed within our regulatory function.

That would be quite a critical issue to make sure you do not end up with someone who can pay a market rent. That was my experience with some of the smaller AHBs. They wanted to get allocations made to people who could pay at the top end of the differential rent in order to build up the assets. They may well have been people who were able to rent outside of the scheme. This would be small numbers but I have seen it happen. It would mean that AHB could build up substantial assets. There is a very unknown quantity about who controls that. I only have 49 seconds left. I was going to ask about the pyrite scheme-----

People have a perception that once these schemes are put in place it will be immediate. However, it rolls out over a long period. Approximately 10,000 dwellings were initially assessed as possible. The estimate is now down to 6,000 and 2,500 have been remediated. It is remediation as opposed to a compensation scheme. How many more are in the pipeline? The qualifying criteria tightened after the initial scheme was put in place in that the house had to be in a worse condition before remediation kicked in. The State elongated it. It is now €22,000 more expensive than the estimate of €45,000. The outworkings figure is now €67,000. Then there is building inflation. Will prolonging this cost more? How many are in the pipeline?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	379	As of December 2022, approximately 3,200 applications had been received and 2,800 approved for inclusion. As the Deputy said, 2,500 have been remediated. We aim to do 2,060 next year. Certainly, it is the intention of the agency working with the Pyrite Resolution Board that we get as many applications in as possible. As I said earlier, we believe this scheme is in the mature phase. We do not want to prolong this. We want to ensure that people get their applications in and this is essentially worked through in the next couple of years. We are doing a review in that regard at the moment. One of the issues has been that previously many of the properties were in estates and there are economies of scale and efficiencies in doing the work whereas we have had more single properties over the past couple of years. We are looking at our processes to ensure that does not delay the remediations going forward.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	384	53,000.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	385	There are potentially 50,000 homes for which the State could provide up to 100% finance in some cases and when the loan finance is discharged, despite the fact that they are within the ownership of the AHBs, which I understand are charities, the local authority will have no allocation power and cannot allocate tenants on the basis of social need. There will be no control over rent. They can charge hello money if they wish and tenants need not necessarily be managed by the AHBs, which, in general, I find good. They could be managed by a private company brought in on its behalf and the interface and any dealings that the tenants have is with the private entity. That is the position. This is a pause and stand back moment for me, looking across these schemes. I have been looking at this for a while. Since I received the briefing document yesterday I have been studying this. Following the clarity this morning on this, it is a pause and stand back moment. This is most serious. Can anyone correct me if I am wrong? We have sleepwalked into this. With up to 50,000 housing units, when the loan is discharged, the situations I outlined can arise. The local authority has no control over allocation. Ms Feeney clarified that. There is no control over rents. People can be asked to claim rent supplement if the body wishes to charge hello money unless some other powers or laws can be found within the statutes of the State to stop this. Hello money can be charged and a private company can be brought in to manage them. Can anybody clarify that I am wrong?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	386	I will speak to that. A piece of work is being done in the Department, looking at this particular situation at the moment. It is referred to as the unencumbered units working group. It is effectively looking at these future pieces particularly around the disparity. Deputy Murphy raised this issue. What happens when the loans are ended is that there is a disparity between the income and expenditure in respect of the particular units. That working group is looking at that at the moment. I gather it is due to report mid-year.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	387	I accept that there is an economic reality that has to be faced in house maintenance but while doing that work, I ask the Department to consider that some of these AHBs are in an position to draw down considerable SEAI grants. The SEAI was anxious to capture groups of houses, particularly where there is a small community centre, which there is in many of these small developments. We have had SEAI before the committee in the past. It was actively seeking them. Some of these bodies may have availed of these. In any look at this taken by the Department or the Housing Agency, I ask that this be factored into it. There may have been substantial funding drawn down in terms of energy upgrades for external wraparounds, internal insulation, changes of heating systems, doors and windows. That should be brought into the case. I have a couple of questions for the regulator. Ms Lyons confirmed that she has the power to cancel AHB registrations but she has not had to do that as yet. She has had eight complaints. Going back to when the finance loan is discharged, has she any powers in that regard?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	388	There is probably some assurance here. Mainly if an organisation is an AHB and is subject to all aspects of our Act - and some examples were mentioned by the Chair - we have the powers to require information and records. Where we do not believe that properties are being managed in the appropriate manner, we have the ability to cancel its registration and transfer those assets only if it is still within mortgage. Once outside mortgage, these assets are owned by independent organisations. We then move into the more complex area of the Charities Act and charitable law. For an assurance framework it is unusual for organisations not to have a mixture of funding and funding tenure, as in the lifetime of that. The regulator is not just regulating a specific property that it is just funding; we are regulating the organisation and how it manages the properties, how it owns them, leases them, maintain them and so on. We have the ability to ask questions on that. That provides an assurance.

That is the question. She seems to be alluding to, once out of that financing period, be it 25 or 30 years, the powers would be under charities legislation only. That is what she is indicating here.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	390	That is correct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	402	It is our role to oversee these bodies and to make sure they are operating in the correct manner. Whether funding ends after 25 years is a contractual matter for the Department. However, our laws and the way our legislation is written at this time relates to how they were funded and, as the Deputy will appreciate, that is exactly where our powers come from. If a property has a mortgage, we have substantial powers. We have the power to go to the High Court and ask for an order where we can bring in new directors and stop the sale or transfer of a property. Therefore, we do have considerable powers in that regard and we will utilise those.

After the 25-year period, AHBs can set the rent themselves, bring in a private company to manage them and ignore the local authority as to allocations. They do not have to go on the basis of housing need. Some of these have never gone on such a basis. I will not say "never" but the practice has not been to consult or take nominations from the local authority. AHBs can hand tenants rent supplement forms and, we have now learned, they can also sell the houses. That is the situation we are in.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	405	The committee has raised legitimate issues and, as my colleague, Mr. Harrington, said, there is a working group in the Department looking at the issue of unencumbered AHBs. It would be wrong to give the impression that the sector, as a whole or in general, seeks to act in a way that is not appropriate. The sector is providing a very good service.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	406	I will clarify that point. I said this at the start. I acknowledge the good work the sector is doing, but we have left a way open, in the design of these five schemes, such that most of these houses can end up in a situation, when they are out of mortgage and the finance is discharged on them, where the State has no control, loses the asset, and tenants have no control over rent. It essentially becomes a private entity and a private matter between tenants and the AHB. The case I outlined is that of a private company brought in to manage them. I accept the vast majority of people who formed small housing bodies over the years did so with good intentions and gave up their time on a voluntary basis. That has been accepted. I also accept that the larger bodies act professionally. My dealings with and observations of them have been positive. I have found them to be good, generally, but not always. I accept that. What I am pointing out is that we have left a way open, through these schemes, for these situations to arise in respect of no less than 50,000 homes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	407	My problem is with the Chairman's last comment about the "no less than 50,000 homes" because I do not think that is the position. He has raised a legitimate issue and the Department is looking at unencumbered houses, but in terms of the sector in general, the larger providers that provide most of those homes, and will have an enduring relationship with the Department, have to work with the State. It is not a scenario that could arise. What we need to do is see if there are any gaps, such as the lacuna the Chairman pointed out. If there is anything else we need to address, we will look at that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	408	The gap is as wide as the barn door. That is how wide the gap is. I accept most bodies will continue to work with the State, particularly if they continue to roll out projects, because they have to play ball with the Department but they could also tell the Department to get lost. They can tell everyone to get lost - the Committee of Public Accounts, Mr. Jordan, the Minister, the Taoiseach, and the Attorney General - because, legally, that is it. All the cards are in their hands after that period.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	409	I am not quite sure that is the case.

The Department is looking at the issue of unencumbered estates. We will consider that. We hear what the Chairman and the committee is saying today. We will work with the regulator, and anyone else, to see if additional measures need to be taken.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	412	I was concerned before 9 a.m. I have become more concerned since. I acknowledge the Department has to deal with it as it is, the design and all that, but this is a very serious matter that needs swift attention.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	413	I refer to Mr. Ó Coigligh's characterisation of it as "a small number of issues". We have just outlined in this session that it seems 100% of AHBs will fully own their assets at the end of the lien on the property. That is not a small number of issues. That is a State approach that will allow us to fund something that we will not have control over as an asset. On the Chair's point, we have heard today that we are at 15% now, but Housing for All will make this 40% to 50%. It could amount to in excess of €1.5 billion being spent every year on an asset over which, in 30 years, we will not have any control. That is a massive issue for this committee. I reiterate that I have serious concerns about the interplay with this and local authorities because it seems there is not sufficient oversight there. I asked the Department earlier for key performance indicators on how it assesses AHB funding schemes. I would appreciate if a list of those indicators could be provided. I presume they are required by the Department of Finance anyway, so they are probably on file somewhere. I agree with the Chair; this is deeply concerning.

How many of the units currently with AHBs were funded through the capital assistance scheme, and has there been any change over the years that would make a difference when the houses that have been funded to date become, as we call it, "unencumbered"?

The other matter falls under the remit of the Charities Regulator because this involves companies that are governed by charity legislation. Is it the case that if they were to change their constitution, they would cease to be charities?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	417	Correct. I am not an expert on charitable law but if a registered charity wants to change its constitution, as a charity, it can seek approval from the Charities Regulator.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	418	Who would be the beneficial owners then?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	419	They are charitable assets. Some 97% of AHBs are charities and, as a result, all their assets are charitable assets.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	420	In the case of an AHB being unencumbered, and where it changes its constitution to cease being a charity, who is the beneficial owner? Who would do that? Is it the directors of the company?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	421	Correct, but under charity law you are not allowed to distribute any profits or anything like that, so if they were to sell a house or a dwelling, those moneys would need to be put back into the charity for its charitable purpose.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	422	Then we come back to the point about the hole in the bucket. Who owns the assets at the end if there is nothing to put them back into? For example-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	423	The AHB is the charity-----
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	424	Yes, but you might end up with a small site with a dozen houses on it and with no room to put another house on it. Where do the assets go? You can do only so much maintenance and upgrading. You could end up with very sizeable assets as a consequence of the State making this investment in the first place for a very good reason. In fact, part of the reason some of these smaller ones came about was that it was an opportunity to deliver on social housing when in fact the local authorities were not delivering the numbers required to be delivered. It was additional. I think we will need to come back to what protections there are for the State in making sure you end up with some degree of control at the end. What has also piqued my interest is that the State is on the one side, where it has paid for the building of these houses, and then, as the point has been made, you may end up having to fund the rent through the RAS or rent supplement, which is ludicrous, because the State is then paying the rent for a house the State paid for to build in the first place. I am absolutely depressed after this morning. I cannot conceive of people designing this kind of scheme and not imagining how it would end or where the roadblocks or the problems would be. I think you are right, Chair. We came in here worried and now we are really worried.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	425	Unfortunately, in this country we deal with an awful lot of short-termism. That is what I call it. There is a challenge for everyone here. There is a challenge for us and a challenge for the witnesses. Mr. Baneham, you wanted to conclude.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	426	Yes. This affects only a relatively small number of units but it might affect more in the future. The Housing Agency has used long-term leases for a number of AHB projects. The one that is probably best known is the Enniskerry Road project. The transfer of the land for that is under a 150-year lease and the freehold has been transferred to the local authority. There are therefore restrictions on use for the term of the lease in that regard and the freehold ownership does not pass to the approved housing body. We have a land fund. We receive money from the Department to buy land for both local authorities and AHBs, and it is envisaged that long-term leasing will be used as the mechanism for transferring land to AHBs under that scheme as well. It has yet to be finalised exactly how that will work, but that is how it is envisaged it will. That type of arrangement, I think, would address a lot of the concerns that have been expressed.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	427	Will you outline that briefly again, Mr. Baneham? Are you talking about housing units that have come out of the end of the financing period?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	428	To a degree the financing period is irrelevant. The land on which the units are built is leased, and there are requirements under the lease in terms of the use of the units, so they cannot dispose of them and they cannot change their use.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	429	What if the land is in the ownership of the AHB, which would be the case-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	430	In the majority of cases this is not the arrangement, but under the lease, effectively, the land would not be in the ownership of the AHB. It would have beneficial ownership because it needs to have beneficial ownership to raise finance etc., but-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	432	This does not apply to the CAF scheme.

There is no legal lien in terms of freehold or leasehold on the land. That is-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	434	No. It relates only to a small number of units at the moment.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	435	We are after dealing with a lot of stuff. It is a big challenge for everyone. I know there is a lot of questioning and scrutiny of the issues, and it is a challenge for the agency, the regulator, the Department and us as public representatives. I thank the witnesses and the staff from the agency and the regulatory body - we wish them well on this - and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as always, for the work involved in preparing for today's meeting. I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for assisting with and preparing for today's meeting. Is it agreed that the clerk will seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed to note and publish the opening statements and briefings provided for today's meeting? Agreed. This meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts is suspended until 1.30 p.m. We will resume in public session, so I ask members to be back on time because we have a lot of business, correspondence, etc., to deal with in the afternoon.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	436	The business this afternoon is minutes, accounts and financial statements, correspondence, work programme, the Comptroller and Auditor General's section 2 report, and any other business. We will then go briefly into private session before adjourning until next Thursday, 26 January. The minutes of our meeting on 15 December have been circulated. Do members wish to raise matters about them? I believe they are accurate. Are the minutes agreed? Agreed. As usual, they will be published on the committee's web page. Accounts and financial statements are next. There are quite a few of these today. Thirty-six sets of accounts and financial statements were laid before the Houses between 12 December and 21 January. I ask Mr. McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to address these before I open to the floor.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	437	As the Chair said, quite a few sets of accounts and statements were laid before the Houses during the recess period. No. 1 is St. Angela's College, Sligo, for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset. The committee will hear me referring to this again today. It is standard for bodies with substantial non-State income, such as universities. No. 2 is the travellers' protection fund, travel agents and tour operators bond accounts for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 3 is the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, for 2021. This received a qualified audit opinion. In my opinion, the accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable. This is standard for many health bodies at the direction of the Minister for Health. No. 4 is the Commission for Aviation Regulation for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion. Nos. 5 and 6 are group accounts - Sport Ireland for 2021 received a clear audit opinion and Sport Ireland Facilities Designated Activity Company, DAC, for 2021 also received a clear audit opinion. The next four relate to the Credit Union Restructuring Board. The first is for the year of account 2018, which received a clear audit opinion. I draw attention to inadequate accounting records, which is the reason four sets of accounts are being done together. After the Credit Union Restructuring Board ended its active period, the members of the board left and responsibility passed over to the Department of Finance, there was effectively a falling down in its accounting records, and it took a considerable time to get that sorted. The board's 2019 accounts got a clear audit opinion, but there were inadequate accounting records. The board's 2020 accounts got a clear audit opinion, but attention was drawn to the inadequate accounting records. The board's 2021 accounts received a clear audit opinion. By then, the Department had got on top of the difficulty with the accounting records. No. 11 relates to the Beaumont Hospital Board for the period of account 2020. It received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to a number of issues. The first was a series of governance issues, including the unscheduled resignation of the chairperson and the appointment of an interim chair, the audit committee lacking members to represent a quorum for a period, and considerable delays in the preparation of the annual financial statements. As a result, these accounts were certified on 21 October 2022. There was also a failure by the board to review the effectiveness of controls in 2020, as required by the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. There were breaches in controls resulting in payroll overpayments totalling €294,000 between 2019 and 2021. There was also non-compliant procurement totalling €16.9 million in 2020.This represented approximately 11% of non-pay expenditure. That was up from 8% of non-pay expenditure in 2019. I should say that the 2021 accounts for Beaumont Hospital were signed by me on 21 December 2022. We were able to get in quickly enough and complete the 2021 financial statements but they have not been presented. They will be presented in due course.  No. 12 is Microfinance Ireland for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. However, I draw attention to non-compliance with European guarantee fund conditions which reduced the amount that Microfinance Ireland could potentially draw down under the funding guarantee by an estimated €968,000. There is a process ongoing whereby it may be able to rectify the paperwork. It may reduce the amount from the €968,000 but we will obviously have an update on that in regard to 2022. No. 13 is the Educational Research Centre. It received a clear audit opinion but in this case I am drawing attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset. Again it is standard for bodies with substantial non-State income. No. 14 is the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. In this case, I draw attention to the fact that I signed off on the account on 30 June 2022. There was a delay in presentation. In line with the committee’s standard procedure, it may want to follow up with the authority to get an explanation on that. No. 15 is the sundry moneys account for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. No. 16 is the Grangegorman Development Agency for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. No. 17 is the Oberstown Children Detention Campus for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. No. 18 is a special account, the hepatitis C insurance scheme for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. No. 19 is Dublin City University for 2020-21. That received a clear audit opinion. Again, I draw attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset. No. 20 is University College Dublin for the year of account 2020-21. That received a clear audit opinion. Again, I draw attention to the assumptions underpinning the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset. I am also drawing attention in UCD’s case to a significant level of procurement non-compliance. The figure was around €6.6 million which is quite sizeable. No. 21 is the Institute of Public Administration for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. No. 22 is Children’s Health Ireland for 2021. That received a qualified audit opinion. As I mentioned previously in relation to a health body, the accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable. I also draw attention to the disclosure of a significant level of non-compliant procurement, in this case approximately €2.2 million.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	439	The figure is €6.6 million in that case. No. 23 is the National Council for Special Education for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. No. 24 is the Digital Hub Development Agency for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to note 6 to the financial statements which discloses that the agency incurred expenditure of €227,500 in respect of 2021 as a result of a vacant site levy charge imposed by the local authority. That was possibly the third year in which such a fine had been incurred. Again, in this case the account was signed off on 20 June 2022 so there has been a delay in submission which the committee may want to follow up on. Next we come to Horse Racing Ireland, the group accounts, and then the next nine are subsidiaries of Horse Racing Ireland. They all relate to 2021 and all received a clear audit opinion. However, I draw attention to a further loss of €1.3 million in 2021 related to Horse Racing Ireland's investment in an associate company, Curragh Racecourse Limited. The cumulative loss on the investment to the end of 2021 was €7.7 million. I do not propose to read out the names of all the subsidiaries. They will be on the list. No. 35 is the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board for the period of account 2020. That received a clear audit opinion. However, I draw attention to cost overruns on two school extension projects and to a settlement related to VAT of €300,000 due for the period 2015 to 2021 resulting in interest and penalty charges totalling €98,000. Finally, No. 36 is Tourism Ireland, which is one of the North-South bodies, for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion.

In regard to the Beaumont Hospital audit, obviously it is not just one issue. There is a range of issues there. As a committee we should correspond with it to find out what it has done to address the four issues. On the governance issue, does it have a permanent chair now? How soon will it have a permanent chair? On the failure of the board to review the effectiveness of controls as required by the code of practice, is it now actively doing that? On the breaches in controls regarding the payroll overpayment, what steps has it taken to prevent that from happening? The non-compliant procurement is fairly significant. It is almost €17 million, or 11% of non-pay expenditure. I propose that we should write to the board in regard to those four matters because it seems that a number of issues there are not as tidy as they should be and need to be addressed. Actions need to be taken. We should ask in correspondence for them to address these matters and come back to us in a timely manner on what measures it is taking in regard to each one.

It is a centre of excellence as well. It is the one that jumps out from the list. I agree we should write and look for that information but we may consider at some point in the future bringing in this hospital and others that follow it in the remit. We might put it down tentatively but I do not think it would be enough on its own. It may well be that we might have a look at some of the issues and whether there are similar issues in other locations and sectors. The university sector stands out. I cannot recall from previous reports for the hospitals that come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General whether similar issues arose. Let us mark that one out.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	444	I have not drawn attention to anything like this number of issues in any of the other hospitals. The other major ones are St. James’s Hospital and Children's Health Ireland. They would be the three big ones. The Dental Hospital and Leopardstown operate on a much smaller scale.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	445	Is Mr. McCarthy satisfied that the issues that were there are now resolved?

I refer to Horse Racing Ireland, No. 25, where attention is drawn to a further loss of €1.3 million. I know there was underinvestment, so there was a need for investment into the racecourse, which by the way is in County Kildare but is not in my constituency, for what it is worth. On the further loss, who picks up that loss and how is it paid for? Does it come out of the public purse?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	453	It is a joint venture. There were other investors in the redevelopment of the racecourse. The equity that was put in has effectively been eroded. It resulted, in 2020 I think, in an additional resource - a loan, in effect - being made available to the company, Curragh Racecourse Limited. From memory, the amount on the State's side was about €9 million, or perhaps a little bit more, but the other investors had to put in an equivalent amount. If the loan has not been repaid by the end of January 2024, it will be converted to equity. Further resources have gone in to meet that loss.

Can we agree and note the listing of accounts and financial statements? Agreed. As usual, the list of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of the minutes. Members will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General presented a report, prepared in accordance with the provisions under section 2(7) of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, to the Dáil on 21 December in relation to an unauthorised release of funds from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. This is on our agenda for discussions after correspondence and the work programme. I suggest, if people are happy to do so, we will leave dealing with it until then. We will move on to correspondence. As previously agreed, items that are not items of discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated. Decisions taken by the committee on the correspondence will be recorded on the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the web page. The first category which members have flagged is category B - correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers as a follow-up to committee meetings. I propose to deal with these items today, one way or another, because we do not want correspondence being pushed out for a number of weeks. They were held over from our meeting on 15 December 2022. No. R1621B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, dated 12 December 2022, provides information requested by the committee arising from our consideration of the report entitled Funding and Deficit Challenges in Voluntary Disability Services Agencies. Members will recall that this concerns section 38 and section 39 organisations. It was flagged for discussion at our meeting on 15 December by Deputies Catherine Murphy, Munster and Carthy but was held over to allow members more time to review it. It has not been flagged for discussion at today's meeting. I propose to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Do members want to add the funding of voluntary disability services agencies to the agenda at one of our forthcoming meetings with the HSE? Let us be mindful of our previous conversations with the HSE. It is such a big outfit, covering so many different areas, that we found in the past when trying to deal with everything that we did not do so effectively. We decided during discussions of the committee that in future, we would try to narrow our engagements and get a focus. Allowing some leeway, perhaps we will pencil in one of those visits by the HSE.

One of the things about which we could correspond with the HSE beforehand is the level of services provided by comparison with the level of funding provided for each region. For example, in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, that my constituency falls under, I am aware that different criteria apply in the availability of respite care for children with disabilities. In Cavan and Monaghan, and I think in Donegal, there is a very high threshold, which means that many families that are desperately in need of such respite care cannot avail of it regardless of their circumstances if their child has been adjudged not to have a disability that is severe enough. If the same child were in a different county, he or she would be able to avail of respite services. That is unacceptable. I see nothing in terms of financial allocation that would result in such a disparity whereby some counties have fewer supports and services available. If we are bringing in the HSE on that issue, we should include that as a matter for consideration. I am told that across the State, on a macro level, the disparities are stark. Children and their families are being discriminated against in respect of the types of services available to them simply based on where they live, which is something we cannot tolerate in our health services.

The policy prevents some children from applying. There will always be disparities with waiting lists and the timeframe within which services are delivered, but here we have a situation where policy is discriminating against children depending on where they live.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	466	It certainly is a postcode lottery. It does not matter if there is disparity in polices; if the funding is not there, people are not going to get the services. The CHO area where I live and which I represent, CHO 7, is twice the size of some of the other CHOs. It is in a rapidly growing area, and is playing catch-up the whole time. When we have our annual meeting with them, we are told that they have historically been poorly funded in this regard. We might have one single HSE but we do not have one HSE standard. Whether it is caused by policies or funding, it is a postcode lottery for people. We have to get to grips with that because we are failing people who are not getting even the limited supports that they should be getting in comparison to other areas. How do we address that? We have to look at the policies but also the funding. We could narrow it down to disability supports, as the Deputy said. Many organisations that deliver disability supports are not directly provided by the HSE but they are outsourced to them, which is another aspect that could further complicate matters. We have to be very specific. One nearly needs to have the briefing from the HSE and have a discussion on it before representatives are called in to get a benefit from it.There are multiple issues involved. How can we resolve them?

We will put them in our programme for future consideration. No. 1620B from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 12 December, providing information requested by the committee at our meeting with the Department on 20 October. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy flagged this issue.

I want to ask the Department about the cost per unit. I know there is a 60-year lifespan on these, which is very good. Does the cost include the connection to the services? How many are on order? What is the lead time for delivery? Is fire certification included in that? Does certification happen afterwards? Is that included in the cost? That is the first matter I wish to raise. With regard to Benefacts, which is the final item referred to in this correspondence, I understand there is a further response pending from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I presume that will come up next week. I will come back to the matter at that stage, but I may well refer to this correspondence.

We have proposed and accepted that we are going to note and publish that item. No. 1625B from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 6 December, providing information requested by the committee regarding the accumulated pension liabilities of the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery. This arose over recent meetings. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed.

#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	474	This matter arose in terms of the regulator, particularly upon the privatisation of the lottery when matters relating to the pensions of previous workers who transferred were not resolved in advance. There are other areas where this has become an issue. Can the Comptroller and Auditor General explain how these anomalies arise?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	475	It is not related to the privatisation of the lottery; it relates to the establishment of the regulator. The regulator took on staff from the public service who had already earned pension entitlements. Effectively, because they came into the organisation with an entitlement to future pensions arising from their previous service, the question was who was going to pay. Was it going to be the regulator and the national lottery fund or was the public service, that is, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or Department of Finance, going to pick up the tab? That was really where the question lay. The regulator has not been providing or, if you like, taking on the liability for periods prior to their establishment. It was, therefore, really a question of who was going to take responsibility for it. I have drawn attention to it for a number of years because it has been dragging on since at least 2015 when a proposal was put to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I am glad to see that it is now moving towards a resolution.

While we are talking about the lottery, the Chairman will recall that we had a number of engagements with its representatives before Christmas. I think "unsatisfactory" would be a term on which we could all agree. We did agree some follow-up correspondence. Perhaps I missed it. Could we get confirmation that the correspondence was sent in terms of additional questions to the regulator and whether a response was issued?

The Deputy should bear in mind the timelines and that people are on holidays, not just here but also within the regulator and the national lottery. We will keep an eye on that, however. We hope to have something in the next week or two. If we have not, we need to revert to the regulator.

We have a fairly extensive list of requests for people from different bodies to come in this year. If members wish to put it in, however, we can do so.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	490	It would be no harm to have a long list and then we can decide from that list.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	491	Absolutely. It is important that we have a long list. Deputies know themselves how it works. Issues come up across maybe three or four different bodies that are big spenders where there is an urgency. It can move things around for us and priorities can change. What we do in that regard is in the hands of committee members. It is a meeting we should pencil in for the future, however. No. 1631B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 16 November, providing information we requested regarding a report on climate action targets. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Carthy raised this item.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	492	Yes. There is not much content-wise although it is a long enough letter. It goes through the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, funding until 2027 and references 2028 to 2030 as being unknown due, obviously, to the next United Nations Forum on Forests, UNFF, covering that period. It would be useful if we could get clarification from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on whether there has been engagement with either the Department of Finance or Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the suggestion from within the European Commission that a larger CAP should be delivered in 2024 to assist the delivery of our climate action plan targets. Second, it would be useful if we could get a sense from the Department, in terms of the climate action plan, on whether it plans to provide additional funding to the delivery of emissions reductions within the agriculture sector specifically or how it intends to operate that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	493	One thing is not clear from reading the correspondence. I noted a piece when I was going through the letter that comes under the subheading, "Electricity and power generation (particularly in relation to back up capacity and energy security)". The letter states: "I am advised that the figure of €1bn for backup capacity within the larger €33-€37bn electricity sector figure consists primarily of incremental battery storage." There is very little detail. It goes on to state, "will predominantly be used to manage solar power on an intra-day basis." I presume it is talking about power that is generated today and used tomorrow. I would like a little bit of detail about that. Wearing a different hat, maybe Deputy Carthy or somebody else here can explain that. Are we talking about some of the finance that will go to farmers for anaerobic digestion or for solar that can be stored by means of batteries?What are we talking about in this regard? I do not know. Is anyone on the committee aware of what that is about?
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	494	This is in respect of which paragraph?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	495	In the third paragraph on page 2, on electricity and power generation, there is a figure of €1 billion "for backup capacity". It is for the agricultural sector. What is the best use for that money? How is it going to be used? There seems to be very little information to tell us that.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	496	There is very little information within the sector either. Part of the problem has been that many of the areas where the agriculture sector, that is, farmers, can play a proactive role in emission reduction targets actually affect other sectors within the climate action plan. Renewable energy generation falls under the energy category. Likewise anaerobic digestion and solar power and forestry, where there has been a lot of debate that it actually falls under the land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, category. There is a lack of joined-up thinking as to how we can use measures adopted on farms that affect other categories to be part of the holistic response to reducing emissions. Part of that is going to be budgetary, I agree.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	497	We should ask for clarification regarding this and specifically what measures are in place for farmers to get directly involved and what assistance is available to them. They are being told to scale down in relation to dairy or beef production. This was the one thing that was held up as being an income generator for farmers to make up for that loss. We will seek that information from the Department.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	498	On the second page at the top, under the heading, "Land-use and forestry", it states "The Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine recently received sanction of €1.318 billion for the next Forestry Programme (2023-2027) from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform." Can we ask the exact date on which this sanction was granted? Were the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Environment, Climate and Communications fully briefed? Regarding the Gresham House investment when did they come into play in this regard? Was that before or after the sanction? I am not quite sure where that is at presently.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	499	I will make a suggestion. It is a major initiative in respect of the forestry programme and as we will be dealing with the 2021 accounts of the Department, I suggest that we bring in the Department to talk about forestry and carbon sequestration specifically within the next months.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	500	There is more than one Department involved. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a role as does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It may be that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has a role as well. It quite difficult to see where this lands or where the buck stops. To be perfectly honest, in the case of most of us, our jaws are still not quite settled after hearing about the Gresham House investment or even where that is at. Can we ask questions in advance and then I would be very happy that we invite them in?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	501	What I suggest is that we ask those questions but I strongly suggest that we put this on to the work programme as well. The Deputy is correct; it will involve other Departments but the key player is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, so we will request that information. Moving on to No. 1633B, it is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, is dated 20 December 2022 and is providing further information that we requested arising from a meeting with the HSE on 6 October 2022. It is proposed to note and publish this item of the correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Munster flagged it but she is not here. Does any member wishes to raise anything? In view of the fact that she is not here and unless there is a compelling reason to hold it back until next week, I suggest that we move ahead. Are members happy to have it disposed of today? Okay, I take that as agreed. No. 1638B is from Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General of the Department of Transport, dated 20 December 2022, providing information the committee requested regarding the DART+ West project from Kilcock to Kildare. It is proposed to note and publish this item of the correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	502	The DART+ West programme is going to be very disruptive while it is under way but it will be hugely beneficial. The railway order has gone in on it. It says that it goes west of Maynooth. In fact it will go 350 m from the railway station in Kilcock but will not terminate in Kilcock and there will be no opportunity for people to board the train in Kilcock. Consequently, the DART will be in Kilcock but people will not be able to board it. It is one of those low-hanging fruit things.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	504	I think there is a process. The last time the National Transport Authority, NTA, or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, I am not sure which, was in, its representatives said a separate process would be required but it could possibly be bolted on to this in terms of the delivery. It is very frustrating to see that a new process is required but one cannot see where that process is going to commence. I know it is part of the transport strategy, which I think was approved by the Cabinet this week. The absence of that approval was part of the reason this did not happen. It looks like madness in the context of this being a growing area.

The Deputy has more information on this than I do.

It is proposed to note and publish it. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Munster wanted to discuss this and I suggest that we hold this item back because there have been significant changes at National Broadband Ireland with new owners and changes in the board structure, as members can see this in the letter. Is that agreed? Agreed. We will move on to No. 1642B, which is from Mr. David Gunning, chief executive of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, dated 22 December 2022, providing an update on the implementation of recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts to the board following the committee's engagement on 9 February and 13 July 2021. It is proposed to note and publish it. Deputy and Munster and I have flagged this item. It raises as many questions as it answers in some ways. Some of the figures jumped out at me. At the end of November 2022, there were 1,764 claims notified for determination. The figure for substantiated claims was 1,450. The figure for claims determined by the employer's representative, ER, was 1,250. The contractor's value on those is just over half a billion euro at €507 million. The value of the ER-determined claims that are disputed and referred to the project board, conciliation and to the High Court is €480 million.There is a very small amount no longer in dispute management. There is only just €1.4 billion. The sheer volume of claims being substantiated, which is at 1,440 currently, is astronomical. Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could answer this question. There is a moratorium on claims, and it is referred to in this letter again. I remember us discussing this last year. Where stands that in regard to this matter? I take "moratorium" to mean that no new claims were allowed after a certain period.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	508	That is what I understood from the meeting we had but, subsequently, it was suggested that there was a moratorium on processing the claims, as opposed to a moratorium on submitting the claims. That is where we ended up in that regard. What difference does it make? It just means that there is an overhang of contingent liability on the project.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	509	There is an industry in building the hospital, but there is also an industry here around claims.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	510	Definitely.

Being reasonable and practical about it, all of us would accept that with such a large project there would be a large number of claims but we are looking at numbers in the region of just over 1,000.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	512	There is a small number of very high-value claims and the ones that are of particularly high value are ones related to delay, who is taking responsibility for delays and if the State pays for the delay. There is a large number of smaller claims but any of them could be valued at €1 million, €2 million or €10 million.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	513	The issue is that if a bill of quantity is submitted and the item is not in the bill of quantity on day one when the tender documents were put out there, then it is an additional cost and it is always a nightmare. The problem with this project is that because it is so complex - we are talking about 6,000 rooms and all sorts of different complexities - then we are more likely to have such a situation. I remember dealing with a contract which had a value of only £1 million, and the claims were more than £500,000 at the time. This was with a local authority, which had not put all its eggs in the basket as regards what it wanted, and it kept changing what it wanted as well.

We had the board in before. If the tender is not nailed down and all of the work is not done in advance, there is a greater chance of then receiving claims afterwards. That is very much where we go back to in terms of where the fault lies. I have continuously raised the delays because the contractor was criticised for not having enough people on site and other such issues. If I recall correctly, because contracts are two-way, the evaluations will not be made until the end of the contract. The amount of substantiated claims is almost on a par with the original estimate for building the hospital, which was an underestimate, but at the same time it just shows the magnitude of what we are talking about here. Nobody doubts that this hospital is needed and that it will be very good when it is opened but we must ask whether it had to be that expensive. I have a concern with the financing of the project, which I think will manifest this year. A certain amount has been agreed and allocated by the Government. We will have agreed that. If some of these claims are paid, we will get to a point where the hospital board will run out of money and if that is the case, I presume there will be a requirement for a Supplementary Estimate. Then we start getting into the territory where we have been given a date for completion. Will that be a date for opening if the funding is not available and the claims are still in dispute? There is a multiplicity of things with which we need to concern ourselves in regard to that as well. Some of that will manifest itself this year, given the amount of money that is left.

The problem will arise when all of the additional claims are put in. That is when the source of the additional money that is required will be clarified. That is where the difficulty will arise. I do not think the problem will arise in 2023 but it could arise in 2024.

When a contractor goes on site to build a house or whatever else, there comes a point when there is a handover. The question is whether legal issues arise if there are still several hundred claims in dispute, if not all of them have been resolved and some of them are before the courts, and if there are implications in terms of a delayed handover. We will ask the secretariat to follow up on that for us.

There is a process for dealing with claims. Following the initial process, there is a right of appeal and taking it further. I do not think that would in any way affect the handover.

My understanding is that the contract should have been set up in such a way that it is in nobody's interest to prolong the substantial completion and the handing over and commissioning of the hospital. I would certainly hope that is the case.

If we were only starting the project last year, the price would have gone completely through the roof. That is important as well.

We will seek clarification. If the price of glass has gone up, and there is high inflation on glass, which I think there is, that would certainly make it a lot more expensive than what it costs because there is a lot of glass.

I have cleared the 2021 financial statements for signing but there is still a process going on. I am still waiting for the final accounts so I would expect in the next weeks to be signing off on the 2021 financial statements. It is probably in the best interests of the committee for it to engage with the board publicly when it has the financial statements.

I will not say what we can do, based on the previous discussion.No. 1643B is from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It is dated 22 December 2022 - we had them all very busy in the week before Christmas - and provides information requested by the committee regarding reviewing planning permissions granted by An Bord Pleanála for telecommunications masts. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Carthy, who raised the matter, is not here. Does Deputy Murphy wish to speak to that correspondence?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	546	The last paragraph in the response pretty much says that people can take a judicial review if they wish. Nobody takes a judicial review lightly. We know that one of the people who made the decisions has at least the prospect of a criminal prosecution hanging over him. We do not want to prejudge what the courts will do, or even whether the matter will go to the courts, but in these situations, would it change the scenario in relation to an overall review if the board took the initiative and examined these decisions to ensure they are solid and do not end up in the courts? That would appear to be a far better approach than pointing people towards the courts.

In other words, if matters wind up in the courts and during that time planning permission is granted for a large number of these masts in places that are being disputed, the masts could be put in place. That is my understanding of the position.

The next category of correspondence is correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. The following items have been held over from previous meetings and we will take them together. The first is No. 1574C from Deputy Neasa Hourigan, dated 11 November 2022, the second is No. 1577C from a former member of the committee, Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, and the third is one from Deputy Matt Carthy, dated 15 November 2022. They concern the Charities Regulator and the alleged operation of a body as a charity that is not registered as such. I understand the same matter was raised at a meeting of the previous Committee of Public Accounts in November 2019 and it is referred to in both items of correspondence. I ask members to keep in mind the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. At our meeting on 24 November, we agreed to request the Charities Regulator to respond to the matter. This letter issued before the recess but unfortunately the individual to whom it was sent no longer works for the Charities Regulator. The secretariat is following this up with the Charities Regulator. I propose to hold over the matter again until the response is received. Is that agreed? Agreed. No. 1584C, dated 19 November 2022, was received from an individual and was also held over. It is a press release regarding Horse Sport Ireland and the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is also proposed to note and publish another item of correspondence held over from the meeting of 15 December 2022. This correspondence was flagged for discussion at the meeting of 15 December by Deputy Carthy but has not been flagged for discussion at today's meeting. In the meantime, further correspondence on the same matter, No. 1647C dated 31 December 2022, has been received from the same individual. It encloses a copy of correspondence to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the procurement process for the horse and pony studbook. It is proposed to note this correspondence and write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to request further information regarding the matters raised. Are members happy enough with that? Obviously, Horse Sport Ireland is not accountable to the committee. We will note and publish this correspondence. No. 1639C, dated 21 December 2022, is from Deputy Catherine Murphy and is a proposal regarding the committee's work programme. It is proposed to note this correspondence. With the Deputy's agreement, we will consider this when we discuss the work programme. That concludes the consideration of correspondence for this week. We will move to the work programme. At our meeting on 15 December last, we agreed our work programme for January and February as follows. On 26 January, we will engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine the appropriation accounts and three chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2021 report, including chapter 7 which we examined earlier today. It will be open to members to discuss any matters arising from our engagement today. On 2 February, we will engage with the HSE to resume our examination of the 2021 financial statements, with a focus on expenditure on disability services, including the provision of disability services by outside agencies, that is, section 38 and 39 organisations; emergency care; and measures to tackle waiting lists.  An issue arose over the Christmas period. The out-of-hours GP service in the midlands region collapsed and the HSE, according to the best information available to me, had very little warning of this. The service was provided by a private company. It sought more money in November, which it received, and the HSE looked for some evidence of the company's accounts and expenditure as justification for granting it more money. I want to be careful in what I am saying but that information may not have been forthcoming. While the HSE was awaiting a response, the company, on 23 or 24 December, notified the HSE that it was pulling the service across the midlands counties, not just counties Laois and Offaly but also the other midland counties, from midnight on new year's night. The HSE put a temporary solution in place to carry over until 15 January. That expired on Sunday night and the latest update, as of yesterday, was that the HSE is still trying to put an interim solution in place for a number of months to get over that. Meanwhile, there is a complexity involved in how this service is provided across the State. There are a number of different models and a whole range of providers. With the permission of members, I ask that we add this to our work programme. I am reluctant to add anything given the importance of focusing on the matters before us but out-of-hours services are basic services where life and death situations arise. Members will have seen all the reports in the media over Christmas and since about accident and emergency departments being overwhelmed. Part of that problem is caused by the absence of out-of-hours GP services and difficulties accessing them. I am sure these issues are arising in the areas all members represent. Last year, the committee discussed the withdrawal of SouthDoc services.I ask, with the perseverance of the committee, that we would add that to it.

In relation to the out-of-hours service, if someone is in Kildare who came from Dublin, he or she cannot get the Kildare out-of-hours service because his or her GP is not in the area. There is a problem generally. Is that an operational issue? Where would our remit come into it?

The HSE provides funding for ancillary staff and buildings. To be honest, it has been a bit of eye-opener to see how it operates. There is a systemic problem because a number of different models are being used and are being provided by a whole range of providers. The HSE on this occasion was held over a barrel in trying to respond to this and put something in place.

In fairness, these are all people who are working from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. Then, they would have to face another 12 hours of being on call. That is one of the difficulties we are having in many areas. There is another problem that was raised by the Irish College of General Practitioners, which was before the health committee recently. There is now a huge number of general practitioners who are over 60 years of age, and they are going to retire in the next five to six years. The question is how we meet that challenge. The Irish College of General Practitioners has now started training of non-Irish doctors who want to practise here as GPs. They are providing a two-year training process for them. There is a challenge in this whole area.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	561	Many GPs did not come out well from this with the funding provision in Laois, Offaly and the other midlands counties. Deputy Burke is correct that GPs are under significant pressure, but they did not benefit in any way from this. The bottom line is that significant funding is going into the provision of our services. The problem is, as the Deputy outlined, that the services are patchy or there are difficulties in accessing them. In this case, on Christmas Eve, we ended up in a situation where there was a week’s notice this service would be gone. That was the first public heard about it. Meanwhile, the HSE has been scrambling since then. In fairness to the regional management in the HSE, it is my sense that they have been doing their very best to fill this gap, first on an interim basis to tide it over until 15 January. Now, they are in the process of trying to extend that by a couple of months. Beyond that, there is another-----

I completely accept the point about people who are going to retire. Primary care is where the future is, and we need to resource it. We cannot have people going to accident and emergency departments because they cannot get a GP. There are all sorts of other knock-on consequences. If we are to look at this, let us ask the HSE for a briefing in advance specifically on GP services, both out-of-hours and where there are shortfalls, what money goes into it, where the gaps are and what the HSE is doing about it.

The problem is that while the HSE seems to be providing a lot, the key part of it is the GP provision, which is in many cases administered by a private company. If the private company decides to cease trading, for want of a better term, at a certain date, it will cease trading. That is what happened, and we have been left in a situation-----

This is going to happen more, where a company that has young employees who cannot get access to GPs will have a full contract with a GP who will be working just with it and no one else.

We all know we have slightly more than half the number of GPs we need in the State. It should be one per every 1,100 people the population. I looked at the figures for our region which show it is at more than 2,000. That is the basis of the problem.

We have to be careful about our remit. We can look at this strategically and we can look at specific areas in the context of taking a more strategic approach. It is a matter of the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to this, staying within that and dealing with the issue in that context.

I want to flag to members that the President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, will address a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad on 2 February from 2 p.m. until approximately 3.45 p.m. or 4 p.m. Previously, when Ursula von der Leyen addressed the sitting of the Dáil and the Seanad at 2 p.m. on 1 December 2022, the committee met from 9.30 a.m. until 12.30 p.m. It had a ten-minute break and it reconvened to consider committee business until approximately 1.45 p.m. It is up to the committee members how they want to proceed here. The other thing we could do is come back to the subject of the business of the committee, or we can miss it for that week if the committee members want.

We should bear in mind that we will not have a small session in the morning. The HSE and the Department of Health will be before the committee. It will be a big morning and it will probably run over. I will certainly not be doing anything to cut it off directly at 12:30 p.m. We should bear that in mind. If the President of the European Parliament will be here in the afternoon at 2 p.m. and if members wish to be in the Chamber for that, which I presume most will, we should put back the business of the committee part of our meeting until the following week and we should defer it.

However, in the case of the HSE, it is normally a full schedule. Okay, we will do that. On 9 February, we will engage with the Department of Health regarding the 2021 appropriation accounts as well as chapter 12 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021, which relates to the financial impact of the cyberattack. We have advised the Department that a specific area of interest is expenditure on emergency departments. On 16 February, we will resume our engagement with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, with a specific focus on direct provision expenditure, international protection and emergency accommodation. I also flag that we should also mention in the invitation the issue of the provision of modular units. On 23 February, we were planning to engage with An Bord Pleanála’s financial statements. At our meeting on 24 November, we agreed to postpone this meeting until the 2021 financial statements are available for the committee to examine. I understand the 2021 financial statements have not yet been laid and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has until the end of March to do so. That could potentially push that out nearer to June. The 2021 financial statements were already examined at the meeting on 14 July. We have done those. Considering the risk that the 2021 statements might not be ready by 23 February, how do the members wish to proceed?We will be bringing the representatives in without those statements being ready. Have members any views on that?

It is five weeks out so we can do that but we would need to do it at this meeting to give notice to the secretariat and whatever body we are trying to swap with.

We will see how we can work this. We agreed some time back to include the Central Bank and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in our work programme with a view to examining chapter 14 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021. That chapter concerns the assessment and collection of insurance compensation fund levies. Since 2018, the fund has been maintained and administered by the Central Bank and is financed by a levy collected by Revenue. Deputy Murphy proposed we bring this meeting forward and include the Department of Finance in it. Does the Deputy want to come in on that?

The reason for bringing them in is specifically regarding the collection of that levy. Is that correct?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	587	There is the section 2 report I published before Christmas. Members might want to examine that with the Central Bank. Revenue is not relevant to that. The committee could split the morning or something.

It would be a better way of doing it. Is that agreed? Agreed. Does any member wish to raise any other matter in relation to the work programme? I mentioned the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other Departments may have their finger in the pie of the forestry programme and the performance of it.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	593	There is a multiplicity of Departments. We have to be careful about asking for representation from the other appropriate Departments. Agriculture is the primary one but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a role.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	594	A representative from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications should be there as well.

We will flag it up with those three Departments that two will be represented but the primary one will be agriculture, in the same way we did with housing. That concludes consideration of the work programme. I confirm for the secretariat that Revenue will come in on 23 February in the same way we had the Department in today, in an assistance role, not as the primary witnesses. We move on to No. 5, the Comptroller and Auditor General’s recently published section 2 report. Members will be aware the Comptroller and Auditor General published a report prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 2(7) of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 and presented to the Dáil on 21 December relating to the unauthorised release of funds from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. The report details an occurrence whereby there was a failure of controls over the withdrawal of money from the Central Fund on 28 October 2022, when the Central Bank issued to the Minister for Finance €738 million more than the amount of credit available to him to fund the delivery of supply services. We could add that to the agenda for an engagement. There are a number of hoops that had to go through and it did not go through the crucial one. Will Mr. McCarthy comment on it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	597	The Chair has summarised it very well. I am not aware we have ever reported before on a matter like this. I certainly am not aware of it in 30 years. It is important the control of funds coming out of the Central Fund of the Exchequer is strong and that it is only done in accordance with law. Effectively, the Oireachtas controls the funds in the Central Fund. They can only be released if there is a legal basis for it. It was an oversight and it is accepted by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank that the control should have been stronger and it should have been stopped. The Department of Finance would have been able to get an extension of its credit so there is no breach of the law in terms of the moneys required for spending, but it is a concern that it was not stopped. The control should have been stronger.

Would members be happy with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	599	I think they have outlined it to us and we have replicated their position in the report.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	601	If the committee wanted to talk to them directly, it has the information required.

The fact is it has happened. They have taken the appropriate steps, or we hope they have, but the uniqueness of it merits us having some engagement with them. When you find a failure, it is about the possibility of it being replicated.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Financial Statements 2020: Housing Agency	606	The Constitution requires me, as Comptroller and Auditor General, to control all issues of funds from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. If there is not a mechanism in place that works, then I cannot do that. That is why the 1993 Act requires me to report to the Oireachtas when the system does not work as the Oireachtas has designed it.

We will have the Central Bank in at the end of February, we hope, and we can finalise that. Do members wish to raise anything else? That is the last one. We will move into private session briefly before adjourning until 9.30 a.m. next Thursday, 26 January. Go raibh maith agaibh.
