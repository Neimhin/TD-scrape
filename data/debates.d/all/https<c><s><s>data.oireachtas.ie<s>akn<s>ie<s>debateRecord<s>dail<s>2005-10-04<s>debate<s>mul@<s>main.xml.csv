#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 35, inclusive, together.When the Government met the Sinn Féin leadership in January, we made it clear that there needed to be an end to all paramilitary and criminal activity and IRA decommissioning had to be completed. This was essential if there was to be any real prospect of re-establishing momentum in the peace process and ensuring the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.On 28 July the IRA stated that it would end its armed campaign. I welcomed that statement. I also made clear that words had to be borne out by actions.As Deputies will know, the Irish and British Governments received a report from the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning on 26 September. This report confirmed that the commission had overseen the completion of IRA decommissioning and that the IRA has now placed the totality of its arsenal beyond use. Very large quantities of weapons were involved. In our joint statement, Prime Minister Blair and I warmly welcomed this landmark development.The work of General de Chastelain and his team on the IICD is greatly appreciated. The independent witnesses, Reverend Harold Good and Fr. Alex Reid, have also made an enormously valuable contribution to the process. These are all men of integrity. Their words were clear and very welcome. They have done the people of this island a great service. We are relieved that this difficult chapter of the peace process can now be closed.Many people have suffered through the use of these weapons. This suffering should not have happened. We cannot forget our sad and tragic past. We cannot undo damage done, but I hope we can also look forward with renewed hope and promise.I appreciate that some people remain to be convinced regarding the decommissioning of IRA weapons. However, I have urged that the importance of the IICD statement regarding IRA decommissioning should not be underestimated.The next report of the Independent Monitoring Commission will be published this month. This will give an indication of progress on the ending of IRA paramilitary and criminal activity. There will be a further IMC report in January. I hope these reports will confirm IRA paramilitary and criminal activity has ended. If this happens, it will certainly boost trust and confidence and greatly enhance the prospects of political progress.In welcoming IRA decommissioning, we have also emphasised the need for progress on completing the decommissioning of loyalist weapons. We hope loyalist paramilitary groups will engage with the IICD and that weapons from these groups can also be put beyond use as soon as possible.The Government remains in ongoing contact with all the parties in Northern Ireland. I have meetings scheduled this month with the SDLP and the Alliance Party. I also hope to meet the DUP and the UUP in the coming period.In addition to ongoing close contacts between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Northern Secretary at official level, I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in London on 27 June. I will meet the Prime Minister again next week to review the current situation. I met the SDLP on 29 July and we discussed political developments, including the IRA's statement that had been released only the day before.I met Sinn Féin on 23 September. At that meeting, I reiterated the message that we needed to see completion of decommissioning and an end to criminality and all paramilitary activity. We also discussed recent violence in Northern Ireland and how momentum in the peace process could be restored. An issue of central importance in ongoing discussions with Sinn Féin is the question of its support for policing in Northern Ireland. In the new situation that arises out of the IRA statement of 28 July and the decommissioning of IRA weapons, this must now be a key priority. We have made it clear that there is no justification for denying full support for policing and that early progress in this area is essential.I am very concerned by the spate of sectarian attacks in communities in Belfast, north Antrim and elsewhere. The Minister for Foreign Affairs met representatives from many of these communities a number of times recently and heard at first hand the details of these attacks. The loyalist violence in recent weeks has been among the most serious seen for many years in Northern Ireland. I unreservedly condemn all of this violence and have called on all other political and community leaders to do likewise. I have also called for strong leadership. This must come first from the Unionist and loyalist parties, although everybody has a role to play in addressing these problems.The US Government continues to play an important and welcome role. I recently met Mitchell Reiss, President Bush's special envoy on Northern Ireland, when he visited Dublin. I briefed him on the current political situation. I know that he and the US Administration have been following recent developments closely and have welcomed them. I do not have any current plans to visit the United States.The Government had no advance notice of the return of the so-called Colombia Three, nor was the matter raised in any discussions with Sinn Féin. Following their return, I instructed my officials to brief the Colombian, American and British authorities on the Government's position. We have stressed that the Government will meet any international legal obligations arising in this case. The Minister for Foreign Affairs recently met his Colombian colleagues in New York and availed of this opportunity to reiterate this point directly. As regards any breach of Irish law, the matter is now an operational one for the Garda Síochána and, as appropriate, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and will be dealt with in accordance with due process.Sinn Féin has confirmed that the content of the newspaper article of 5 August by the Sinn Féin leader regarding Oireachtas participation by Northern MPs was exaggerated. I will write to the other party leaders shortly with proposals on this matter and seek their views on these proposals. The proposals, which relate to both Houses, will be faithful to the recommendations of the all-party committee report. This House will ultimately decide for itself how it wishes to proceed. There is no question of granting Northern Ireland MPs any rights and privileges in this House.Deputies will be aware that both Governments are committed to dealing with the question of so-called on-the-runs, OTRs, in the context of a verified end to all IRA paramilitary and criminal activity. Proposals will be made towards the end of this year. Any such proposals will not apply to anyone involved in the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. I have already made it clear that there will be no early release for those already serving sentences for that crime. The question of further sessions of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will be kept under review.I met the family of the late Joseph Rafferty on 27 September and told them that I would again raise their concerns with the Sinn Féin leader when we next met and would pass on their concerns to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The question of charges and court proceedings against the person or persons responsible for the murder are operational matters for the appropriate authorities.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Taoiseach for that comprehensive reply in respect of Northern Ireland issues. This side of the House has accepted the word of General de Chastelain and the two clergymen with regard to the detail of what they saw being decommissioned. On foot of his meeting with General de Chastelain can the Taoiseach say whether the amount seen by the general and his colleagues as having been decommissioned is in line with the estimate provided to them by the Government? Does the Taoiseach intend at any time in the future to publish the estimate the Government provided to General de Chastelain in the first instance, to give the public a real and accurate perception of what was involved?People often view the meetings the Taoiseach attends in his capacity as Taoiseach from different points of view. I assume public servants or other Ministers were present during the Taoiseach's various official meetings with Sinn Féin delegations. The Taoiseach has also held a number of meetings in his constituency clinic with members of Sinn Féin, including the president of that party. People are sometimes confused about whether such meetings are official meetings or simply meetings with acquaintances. Did the Taoiseach discuss a range of issues with Sinn Féin officials — I refer in particular to the president of Sinn Féin — at the meetings that were not listed as being official? Would the Taoiseach like to indicate what the issues were?I am conscious that other Members would like to ask questions. Six of the questions before the House are in my name. I would like to ask another supplementary question after the Taoiseach responds to the questions I have asked.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	General de Chastelain's full team from the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was present during the meeting I had with him last week. At that meeting, he reiterated what is in his statement — that he is quite satisfied about all of the decommissioning issues and that the decommissioning is in line with the estimates given by security sources. It was not the Government that gave the commission the details of what was considered to be held by the IRA. The estimates were made by the Army and the Garda. The agreement on all of that, as it is set out, is that at the end of the period, when decommissioning is finished and General de Chastelain and his team have fulfilled their role, those issues will be clarified. They are on the security records.I do not make any distinction between the types of meetings mentioned by Deputy Kenny. I often meet people to discuss Northern Ireland outside the glare of publicity, because that is more convenient. The message does not change on such occasions. Like my predecessors, I have always held such meetings with all kinds of people from Northern Ireland. The president of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, is one of the people I meet in such circumstances, but he is certainly not the only one. People from Northern Ireland often agree to meet me only if the meetings are not publicised. There are many reasons for that. I have met people who represent all kinds of interests and groups, including the UDA, the UVF and the Red Hand Commandos, in such circumstances. Such people do not want to be photographed with me and at times I do not want to be photographed with them. The basis of the meetings does not change. I have met representatives of many other organisations and groups in Northern Ireland, but the message never changes. The messages I communicate at the meetings are always kept on the record of my Department, in so far as they are relevant. The message I communicated at my meetings this year with Sinn Féin, which was mentioned by Deputy Kenny, was exactly as I have outlined. I spoke about the need for decommissioning, an end to criminality and an end to paramilitarism. That message never changes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I am satisfied with the Taoiseach's clarification that the estimate was not actually provided by the Government, but by the Garda and Army intelligence. It may be possible at some future time to be given an idea of the estimate.Will the Taoiseach give the House an update, based on the briefings given to him, on what is happening in respect of the follow-up to the Northern Bank raid? Quite a long time has passed since the House was last given any news or information about the matter. It is obvious that some high-profile personnel in the country have been mentioned as being associated with the Northern Bank raid. Perhaps the Taoiseach might like to give some information, in so far as he can, about what is happening in that regard.I am glad the Taoiseach met the Rafferty family, as did I. This murder has all the sinister qualities of and similarities to the McCartney murder. How struck was the Taoiseach by the strength, force of argument and conviction of the family about the murder of Joseph Rafferty? Will he ensure that his efforts are based not only on his next meeting with Sinn Féin but that he will continue to raise these concerns until such time as the perpetrator or perpetrators of this murder, who appear to be very well known, are brought before the courts and serve under the justice and laws of the land for this atrocious crime?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	We receive continual updates on the Northern Bank robbery. It is being intensely investigated and very senior members of the Garda Síochána are involved in that. It is a complex matter. Without getting into detail, the Garda is getting on with it. The effort has focused on the money trail and this continues to be the case. The matter is complicated so I will say no more. However, it is focused on the money trail.I met the family of Joseph Rafferty, as did many Members, on 27 September. I expressed the Government's sympathies on their tragic loss along with the hope that the person or persons involved would be brought to justice at the earliest possible time. I confirmed to the family that I had raised the matter with Sinn Féin on Friday, 23 September. I indicated that I will raise some of the issues which the family asked me to raise at my next meeting with Sinn Féin, which will take place in the near future.Any action with regard to charges and court proceedings against the person or persons responsible is a matter for the appropriate authorities. However, as Deputy Kenny stated, while we must leave all of the legal aspects of these matters to the investigation, it is always uncomfortable when everybody seems to know what happened and everybody gives the same names. Nonetheless, it is necessary for the evidence to stand up in a court of law. The family acknowledge that the Garda Síochána is working closely with them to try to bring the murderer and accomplices to justice.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I commend the Taoiseach and all those directly involved in the peace process. This issue is bigger than all of us and, hence, I commend all those involved, right back to the Hume-Adams talks, such as Mr. Albert Reynolds and Fr. Alec Reid. Does the Taoiseach agree that we all owe a huge debt to these people?Does the Taoiseach share my concern about recent sectarian attacks? I also raise the question of loyalist guns. What plans have the two Governments on this major issue which directly affects the Northern minority? With regard to loyalist guns and Ulster Resistance, has the Taoiseach asked Dr. Paisley or Mr. Peter Robinson about the importation of loyalist guns which were subsequently used for sectarian attacks? Does he accept the Northern minority is fed up with many speakers in this House who constantly ignore their plight, particularly in recent weeks?When the Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Vice President of Colombia, did he raise the issue of human rights abuses in that country? Did he meet the Coca Cola workers whose colleagues were slaughtered on the front line in their factories? Did he meet human rights representatives and lawyers whose families were butchered by right-wing death squads, backed by the military government in Colombia? Did he raise these human rights issues? There are two sides to that conflict. We must hear both sides if we are to try to assist and develop the peace process there.Must we all hang around while the DUP makes up its mind? Does the Taoiseach accept that many of us are getting sick to the teeth of the DUP's constant undermining of General de Chastelain and others such as Fr. Alec Reid? When does he foresee real dialogue and the institutions up and running?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank the Deputy for his opening remarks about everybody who has been involved. Fr. Alex Reid and Rev. Good are people of the highest integrity and credibility and I hope people take note of what they said. There is a growing view that perhaps people will take note and that they will understand the job they have done and the assistance they have given.My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, met the Minister for Foreign Affairs, not the Prime Minister, of Colombia. He covered the issues in respect of the Colombia three from our side and in terms of our responsibilities. He also raised human rights and other issues generally.There has been much sectarian violence over the past five or six weeks, particularly since 12 July and again from 10-12 September when the situation was very serious, certainly for a period of approximately 48 hours. That concerns us. There have been a number of sectarian acts on all sides that have not been helpful. The Deputy will appreciate that I have to try to be even-handed all the time. People from the Nationalist community and from the loyalist community correct uneven-handedness.I condemn all sectarian acts. I condemn the sectarian attacks on Dr. Paisley's church in recent days when a number of windows were smashed. I condemn the loyalist protest last weekend at the blessing of Catholic graves in a municipal cemetery in Carnmoney in Antrim. That graveyard serves both Catholic and Protestant communities but loyalists are alleged to have threatened to exhume bodies and to urinate on the resting places of Catholics in a shared cemetery. Clearly, this is a particularly repulsive sectarian display which I condemn outright as I do all attacks. The loyalists groups appeared to make a comparison between the blessing ceremony and the previous forced re-routing of the Orange parade in Whiterock. All right-thinking people — Catholic, Protestant and neither — are repulsed by these so-called protests and our officials in Belfast will continue to monitor the situation. Whether committed by so-called Nationalists or so-called loyalists, I condemn all such attacks equally. It is appropriate for me as well as everybody else, to do that.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I wholeheartedly welcome the report of General de Chastelain, Fr. Reid and Rev. Good. In welcoming the involvement of everybody who has helped to bring about the verification and the move beyond violence on the part of the Provisional IRA at any rate, and given that the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that contacts with loyalists paramilitaries were being pursued, will the Taoiseach indicate whether any reports can be given as to the success of those contacts or whether there will be any progress in the near to medium term future on loyalist decommissioning?Does the Taoiseach see as significant the visit by Dr. Paisley to a Roman Catholic school and his strong condemnation of the loyalist violence against that school in his constituency? Does he see further signs of an acceptance by the DUP that we are moving into a new reality? I hope we can be absolute in our condemnation of violence from any quarter.I understand the independent monitoring commission report is due this month. Does the Taoiseach have any indication of the report's import? Given the suspicion in some Nationalist areas of the IMC's motives, does the Taoiseach believe the remit needs to be broadened to include State collusion and the wider aspect of criminality in some paramilitary activities? Will the Taoiseach indicate if this is on his agenda? Given the feuding in loyalist areas and the need for Sinn Féin to come on board the policing board to play a full part in ensuring normal and effective policing, will the full implementation of the Patten report's recommendations be accelerated?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	8	We cannot be sure what loyalists may do in the future. However, in every way possible we will keep the contacts we have established. We have some and we will not overstate that, but we try to keep lines of communications open. Some relatively good contacts have been built up, including recently. Precisely what way the loyalists will go is a matter to leave for some time. There is a debate as to where all this will go. The more progress that can be built on the events of last week and July, the better.We must understand there is a sense of alienation in many of these communities. Regardless of what flag is flying in an estate, loyalist or Nationalist, the problems are similar. We must seek to be helpful and supportive in every way. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, myself and officials on the ground always try to balance whatever we do because it is the best way to make progress. As the Deputy rightly said, we have been monitoring the situation closely in some loyalist areas. The recent upsurge of violence has been a setback, tarnishing the positive image of Northern Ireland. However, there is no question of people returning to violence. Some of it comes from fears or concerns. Perhaps it is felt it is the only way to get a response. We must continue to ensure it is understood that it is not acceptable.We must also condemn attacks from the other side, such as those on Dr. Paisley's church on the Ravenhill road. While not receiving much publicity, it has been brought to my attention that several Orange Order halls in County Antrim have been attacked. These must be condemned while, at the same time, we must work to make political progress. Some loyalists feel they have been alienated. We must continue to point out that the Good Friday Agreement is about restoring institutions. We should not wait until the second IMC report is published in January to restore institutions. We must continue to work and make the effort between now and then.The British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and I will be active in doing this over the next several weeks. We must wait to see how we can build on recent events. I have, as well as Mr. Blair, scheduled meetings and we will both meet to see how we can plot a path forward until the second IMC report in January.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Returning to the Taoiseach's first statement on the totality of IRA weaponry having been decommissioned, will he deal with recent reports in the media that the IRA may have been permitted to keep several hundred weapons for its own use? Has he an assurance from the British Government or General de Chastelain that no side deal has been done in this regard? In the period between now and the publication of the second IMC report in the new year, how does the Taoiseach intend to encourage dialogue between the parties in Northern Ireland?I am sure the Taoiseach is well aware that there was much dismay and frustration, particularly on the part of the SDLP, in how it was excluded from the process leading up to the failed Leeds Castle negotiations. Will he ensure that parties like the SDLP and others will all be included in the discussions and dialogue, if there are any? It should not be simply a matter for the two Governments to meet between now and the new year.The Taoiseach has finally stated he will write to the leaders of the Opposition parties with regard to the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which I welcome. The recommendations were designed carefully to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is not undermined. Will they be the sole subject of his correspondence?As far as the Rafferty family is concerned, does the Taoiseach agree this family, like the McCartney family, has shown extraordinary courage and bravery in circumstances no Member would wish to experience? The Taoiseach has stated he will raise this matter the next time he meets the Sinn Féin leader. Will this be an official or an unofficial meeting? In view of the comments he has made in the House, will the Taoiseach state whether a minute is kept of unofficial meetings? While he has stated there is no difference between the two, the records of these meetings are of central importance. Is a record kept of these unofficial meetings? There is no reason why one cannot have an official meeting without photographs, but it is not possible to have one without a record or without civil servants. Hence, there is a difference. When the Taoiseach meets on the issue of the murder of Mr. Joseph Rafferty, will a minute be kept, will it be an official meeting and will it be an ongoing issue for him?In respect of the Colombia three, has the Government received a formal request for extradition from the Colombian authorities and will the Taoiseach comment?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	On the arms issues, the only report is that the totality of the arms have been given up. This was confirmed to me when I met General John de Chastelain and his colleagues last week. There are no other arms and that is the position. No understandings exist on the part of anyone about any arms being held back. I have no information on the source of that assertion. It was certainly not General John de Chastelain, the decommissioning body or the two Governments.On the question of the Colombia three, the Government has received a request for their extradition. As I stated in my reply, it will go through the process of both a Garda investigation and a DPP investigation.Regarding the Rafferty case, I raised this at the last meeting with Sinn Féin, which was attended by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and quite a large number of officials. Consequently, there are several records of those meetings. As I have stated previously, when I meet people from Northern Ireland, I do not distinguish between meetings that are official or unofficial. However, if matters of note transpire, they are noted. Whether I am there alone or otherwise, I always relay them.In this House, there is a lack of understanding on the part of some Members which I understand, as they have never been involved in such situations. People from Northern Ireland regularly come to me as Taoiseach — as they did to previous Taoisigh and Tánaistes — to have meeting to which they would not come with officials. That has been their practice. It is simply the way they are and the Deputy has to accept that. If anything is raised, I pass it on. It should not be read in any other way. There will be a meeting with officials at the next meeting because we must go through a number of items. The Rafferty family has asked me to raise some of these issues again and I will do so. They believe that Sinn Féin could be helpful in getting a prosecution.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	11	To be blunt, they know the name of the person who committed this crime and that he is a member of the IRA. Is that not the case?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Garda will deal with that.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	So the Taoiseach will not deal with that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	14	It must be proved.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I know that. They are alleging that they know the person and the Taoiseach has spoken to them.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Allow the Taoiseach speak without interruption.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I have spoken to them, but knowing and believing something and proving it are entirely different things.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Will the Taoiseach raise this issue as a priority with Sinn Féin?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	19	He said that he would.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I already raised it at the last meeting, along with some other points. I already stated in a reply to Deputy Kenny 20 minutes ago that the same name continually comes up in all discussions on this case. I also stated that there are associates whose names are mentioned as well. There are a number of issues which the family have asked me to raise, but we have already raised that particular point. Everyone is mentioning the same name but that must be proved. As the Deputy knows, that is not easily achieved.I do not accept that any of the parties have been left out — I would never do that — or that they were left out at Leeds Castle or anywhere else.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The parties feel that way.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	22	They do but I do not accept that. If we talk to Sinn Féin to use its influence to get the IRA to decommission its guns, there is not much point in talking to the SDLP about it. If the DUP has a particular problem, then we talk to the DUP about it. We could not move on in many of these meetings, we had to deal with issues such as decommissioning and criminality, so there was more time spent talking to some of the other parties. That is where the pressure points existed in those talks.The lion's share of the Irish Government's own meetings has been with the SDLP. We would meet the SDLP more often than any other party, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers. The small loyalist parties often make the point that we do not spend enough time talking to them, but we have been trying to do that. We cannot completely influence them, but we can help them in their difficulties. In future meetings, we will continue to deal with all of the parties and to try to make progress.The second IMC report will be crucial. If all is not well there will not be too much talking to be done. If all is well, however, I hope that we will be able to get into really meaningful discussions on getting the institutions up and running.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I would just like to ask a brief supplementary question.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Deputy asked two or three supplementary questions already. Deputy Morgan's party had a question submitted.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Some people cannot get away from the issue of officials and guns, but hopefully General de Chastelain will come back and deal with that.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Could the Deputy confine himself to the question?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Given the enormity of the announcement by General de Chastelain of the IICD on 26 September, will the Taoiseach now move to develop a Government strategy around the issue of Irish unity? I noted the comments of the Minister for Transport last weekend, which were extremely positive in this respect. Does the Taoiseach support those comments? Can the Taoiseach confirm that he does not share the opinion of that small group, comprised of Conor Cruise O'Brien and the current leader of the Twenty-six County Labour Party, who would like to see the issue of Irish unity abandoned altogether?Will the Taoiseach outline the steps the British Government will take to dismantle the obscene necklace of British army watchtowers, especially those along the Border, and to deliver real demilitarisation in Ireland? When can we expect some real movement in terms of British demilitarisation?On the issue of re-establishing the Assembly and the Executive, is the Government seriously proactive in this regard? Many of us are concerned that too many people are perhaps DUP watching rather than getting on with the business of ensuring that the institutions are put back in place.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The effort now will be to work towards getting successful IMC reports. We have got the IICD reports and the IRA statement, so now the effort will be to try to deal with the issues around restoring the institutions, policing and stability in the institutions. We must try to have satisfactory arrangements so that people will be confident that if we get things up and running they will stay up, not like what has happened over several years.In regard to watchtowers and demilitarisation generally, we have seen a significant scaling down of the British military presence in Northern Ireland in recent months. A number of the security observation posts in the Border area have been dismantled. These measures are a useful contribution to normalisation of society. We want to see demilitarisation completed within the two-year period set out in the Joint Declaration. That is what we believe will happen. In the light of progress already made in the recent moves of the IRA, I hope this programme can be completed within this time, if not sooner. If it can be done sooner, all the better, but it is well specified in the Joint Declaration agreed a few years ago. The British Government is committed to that and Prime Minister Blair has reiterated that commitment. We will continue to push to ensure that is achieved.

We will certainly endeavour to get it to do that.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, reiterated what I said in a recent speech in Cavan. I obviously agree with what he said as he repeated what I said. I agree with a number of other colleagues who also said it. That is what is set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It is sometimes forgotten that this Agreement, which the people clearly supported, stated that while the principle of consent is accepted it is the people within Northern Ireland who will ultimately resolve the issue, and it did cover plebiscites that will take place from time to time.Deputy Morgan will know as well as I that the time to press that issue is when stability and confidence is restored and when we have the institutions up and running, at which time we can get on with progress in North-South bodies. Even during the care and maintenance arrangements under which we have operated in recent years, all of my Ministers have continued to engage actively and proactively on North-South matters. We will continue to do that and try to build as successfully as we can.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The draft regulations on veterinary medicines, which were circulated by my Department in August for consultation, are designed to give effect to EU Directive No. 2004/28 and to reform aspects of the existing national regime for consultation. The Department received written submissions from most of the main stakeholders and subsequently met many of them as part of the consultative process. In addition, as required by the relevant legislation, the animal remedies consultative committee will meet shortly to consider the draft regulations, following which I will make final decisions on the issues involved so the regulations can be brought into force by the transposition deadline.I am aware of views that have been expressed about the possible impact of the draft regulations on competition in the supply of veterinary medicines, in particular from the requirement in the EU directive that all veterinary medicines for food-producing animals be subject to prescriptions. However, the directive also includes a provision for exemption criteria to be adopted at EU level. These will provide a mechanism for certain categories of medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement. The European Union has not yet adopted a decision on the exemption criteria but must do so before 1 January 2007. Pending this decision, existing national prescription and distribution arrangements will remain in place under the directive.It is my intention to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible and the Department has made a submission to the European Commission seeking to retain off prescription, so to speak, in Ireland all products, other than intramammaries, which currently enjoy this status. The draft regulations published by the Department provide that veterinary medicines, such as wormers and certain vaccines, will continue to be available off-prescription for the time being. In practice, this means we are retaining the essence of our existing national prescription and distribution regime except in the case of intramammaries. Accordingly, it is not necessary at this stage, for competition reasons, to extend the range of persons who may be permitted to prescribe.While the regulations in this area must, of necessity, give primacy to the protection of public health and animal health and welfare, I am acutely aware of the need to minimise costs to the farming sector and to ensure effective competition in the area of veterinary medicines. With this in mind, the Department has included a number of important changes in the draft legislation to achieve this objective. Among these are the removal of inflexibilities in the existing prescribing regime which will reduce the need for mandatory farm visits by practitioners. This will also anticipate needs, particularly for management-type products, by extending the life of a prescription from the current 31 days up to six months. This will facilitate the farmer and his or her veterinary practitioner, where appropriate. Another change is the new requirement for veterinary practitioners to issue written prescriptions in all cases to ensure that farmers are made aware of the cost of medicines as distinct from the professional service given, and to facilitate the purchase of medicines at premises other than that of the veterinary practitioner. Another change is the permitting of licensed retailers to supply prescription-only medicines for the first time.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.It is evident from the foregoing that my Department is doing everything possible, in so far as it has the flexibility to do so, to create an environment in which in can ensure that there continue to be competition in the supply of veterinary medicines. When the exemption criteria issue is resolved in the course of next year, I will review the regulations and, in particular and in light of the outcome, the provisions relating to the categories of persons who would be permitted to prescribe the current range of so-called off prescription veterinary medicines with a view to ensuring competition in the marketplace and to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on farmers. Full consultations will be held with all stakeholders on the matter at that stage before final decisions are taken.

Will the Minister consider the provisions that have been put in place in the United Kingdom, including across the Border in Northern Ireland, regarding the same directive where competent persons, not only veterinary practitioners, can issue prescriptions?What would happen if no veterinary practitioner were available in north Mayo, for example? This problem is becoming more frequent throughout the country. Is it not the case that the Competition Authority has already criticised these proposals in the belief that they will reduce competition? What will be the cost of these prescriptions to farmers?

As I indicated previously all the organisations and individuals involved put their views and I am awaiting the consultative committee who will advise me on this matter. I will make further announcements over the next two to three weeks. I agree that cost is an issue and on that basis and because I am not happy with the regulation I may introduce other aspects into it. One of the issues presenting difficulties for all of us is that the exemption list is not being dealt with prior to the full implementation of the directive. There will be no changes up to 1 January 2007. In the interim I will examine the issues of competent authorities and of education and I will take the cost factor into consideration. I will also take the black market into consideration. This is a situation of which those of us living in the Border counties are acutely aware. To make a practical and balanced decision, I will take into consideration many of the views expressed by Members on both sides of the House and by all those involved.There will be no change up to 1 January 2007 except for intramammaries with which I will deal in the next two to three weeks following the receipt of recommendations from the consultative committee. I will also reflect on a number of practical and pragmatic issues that I hope will address the balance between supporting the cost factor for the farmer and the health, safety and welfare of the animal and of the consumer.

Is it not the case that all 25 member states must agree to the contents of the exemption list? The Minister's officials have stated that if she fails to achieve a decent and expanded exemption list, she will go back to Brussels and propose licensed merchants and pharmacists be permitted to issue prescriptions. What is the feasibility of going back to Brussels and looking for a downward revision once the regulation has been implemented?

The Deputy is correct in saying the exemption list must be agreed by the 25 member states. If this agreement is not forthcoming between now and 1 January 2007, I will in the interim reflect on the implications and make a balanced decision on what is required to address the concerns expressed. I will await the publication of the exemption list and listen to my advisory committee. I will consider alternative arrangements if the outcome is not to our satisfaction.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I ask for a bit more than that.A particularly virulent high pathogenic strain of avian influenza has been affecting countries in south-east Asia since December 2003. Both Russia and Kazakhstan confirmed the presence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain in poultry in August. The high pathogenic strain has not been reported anywhere in the European Union since 2003, when there was an outbreak in the Netherlands.It is important to realise that avian influenza is a disease of birds and while people can become infected, they rarely do. There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from poultry to humans other than by direct contact with infected birds. Notwithstanding the approximately 60 deaths in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, the World Health Organisation takes the view that the experience in south-east Asia, "indicates that human cases of infection are rare". The majority of deaths have occurred in rural areas and most have been linked to direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry, particularly during slaughtering, defeathering and food preparation. According to the WHO, no cases have been confirmed in poultry workers nor have any cases been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs.Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are concerns that a possible mutation or a genetic change in the virus circulating in Asia could lead to the virus transforming into a new strain of influenza capable of human-to-human transmission. Responsibility for preparing for such an eventuality rests with the Department of Health and Children and its agencies. My Department is a very active participant in that Department's influenza pandemic expert group and is contributing to update its influenza pandemic plan.As regards the disease in poultry, I share the conclusion of the standing committee on the food chain and animal health working group on avian influenza that the confirmation of the high pathogenic outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan is a cause for serious concern and I acknowledge that the key to limiting the extent of any outbreak is early detection and rapid action.Since the confirmation of the outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan, my Department has been very active in reviewing all aspects of our contingency arrangements and several measures have been taken to improve our preparedness to deal with any suspect or confirmed outbreak. Given the critical importance of early detection, my Department has, with the assistance of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils andBirdWatch Ireland, introduced an early warning system where increased or unusual patterns of wild bird mortality are observed. This early warning system is just part of a more intensified approach to surveillance, including surveillance of wild birds and poultry. The 2005-06 poultry surveillance programme is already under way and my Department has made arrangements for increasing levels of wild bird surveillance at a number of locations throughout the country. In addition, officials from my Department have recently met their colleagues from the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and have agreed to continue to work closely together and to exchange the results of their respective wild bird surveillance programmes. The two Departments will review progress at a further scheduled meeting this month.Migratory birds can carry the viruses for long distances and have, in the past, been implicated in the spread of high pathogenic avian influenza.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The Minister's time has concluded.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	54	It is an extensive answer.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIn August the Commission expert group considered the possibility that the disease could be imported into the EU via migratory birds, particularly water birds and concluded, based on the existing knowledge of migratory routes of the species of birds proceeding from central and western Asia and that might pose a threat of spreading the H5N1 virus, that ‘the immediate risk of introduction of avian influenza through these birds is probably remote or low.' According to BirdWatch Ireland, most of the birds breeding in the affected areas of Siberia will migrate for the winter to the south and east of Europe and to Asia and will not visit Ireland.The EU Commission recently extended until September 2006 safeguard measures that have been in place since 23 January 2004. Furthermore, these measures, which originally applied only to affected countries in south-east Asia, have now been extended to Russia and Kazakhstan. These measures include a ban on live poultry, birds other than poultry and poultry products, other than heat-treated poultry meat and treated feathers.Poultry meat that is properly cooked does not present a risk of infection as the virus is destroyed at temperatures at or above 70 degrees Celsius. My Department has increased its checks on commercial products and products in personal luggage from all affected countries. There is no evidence to indicate that untreated poultry meat is being imported illegally. In addition, my Department is currently reviewing the information we make available to flock owners on biosecurity and clinical signs of the disease, as well as to travellers, particularly to those countries which are infected.While we take all reasonable steps to avoid an outbreak of avian influenza, particularly because of the potential threat posed by migrating wild birds we cannot dismiss the possibility of an outbreak. Our resources are focused on ensuring early detection and speedy eradication and minimising any risk to public health. The measures already put in place are designed to ensure that any suspect outbreak is investigated quickly and the existence of the virus confirmed or otherwise. My Department has been ensuring that the appropriate technical and veterinary staff is properly equipped to deal with any suspect/confirmed outbreak and we have examined all aspects associated with the destruction of inflected flocks and the subsequent disposal of the carcases. Officials from my Department recently participated in a successful trial slaughter of poultry in Northern Ireland. This is further evidence of the level of cooperation between the two Departments.I fully acknowledge the risks associated with an outbreak of avian influenza and accept that there is no room for complacency. Notwithstanding the low probability of an outbreak of the high pathogenic strain that might pose a risk to human health, my Department is maintaining a vigilant approach to the threat posed and constantly reviewing the adequacy of our contingency arrangements in the light of any new information that emerges.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The recent warning from the World Health Organisation contained a staggering statistic of the probability of between 5 million and 150 million projected deaths from a 'flu pandemic and this warning should be heeded by all.I appreciate the important role to be played by the Minister's Department and the perhaps more significant role to be played by the Department of Health and Children. However, some of the issues refer specifically to agriculture. What controls are in place at airports and other ports to oversee the import of any foodstuffs, particularly in light of the risk from avian influenza?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I reiterate that vigilance is uppermost in our minds. The Department and its counterpart in the North work in co-ordination with each other as does the Department and the Department of Health and Children and other agencies. I reassure the Deputy that the evolving scientific evidence as provided by the EU will be reflected in our contingency plans. Vigilance is being maintained in the airports and ports. I assure the House that live poultry imports from the countries referred to in my reply are banned. Cooked poultry products are not banned. The Department is maintaining vigilance in this matter and will not be complacent. I applaud the co-operation between North and South. Ireland will work with its EU partners in supporting those countries that do not have the capability to deal with the outbreaks.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	57	What specific advice on this matter has been given to the poultry industry? If there was an outbreak of avian flu, it would have economic consequences for that industry and a subsequent impact on human health.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	All those involved in the sector have been informed about this matter and information leaflets have been made available. In the event of an outbreak of this disease, those at the frontline would include not only those involved in the poultry sector but Department officials who are fully au fait with the implications. My Department has ensured that those officials have the necessary equipment in the unlikely event of this matter arising.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I have not taken a decision on the future of the early retirement scheme. The EU Council regulation covering the current scheme will expire in December 2006. The Council regulation on rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 again includes provision for member states to operate early retirement measures. No decisions have yet been taken regarding the schemes to be operated in Ireland under this regulation.The early retirement scheme was introduced as one of a number of instruments to improve the age structure of Irish farming and improve the viability of farm holdings. From this point of view, the first scheme from 1994 to 1999 was successful. However, take-up has fallen short of expectations, and an expenditure review carried out in my Department in 2004 raised a number of questions about the effectiveness of the scheme in achieving its objectives. Structural reform is still a priority both at home and at European level, and we still need to provide opportunities for young farmers. In framing proposals for the next rural development round we need to consider how best to achieve those results in light of the funding and the options that are available.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I thank the Minister for her reply. I note she said that she has not yet taken a decision on the future of the scheme. I also note she was quoted as saying she was putting forward the idea that the scheme had run its course and that she would listen to what people have to say about this. I hope that was not a case of her stirring the pot and that she will listen to what farmers have to say about this scheme.The message I have got from farmers is that scheme was innovative when introduced and that it was a good scheme. Over the 11 years it hasbeen in place, approximately 12,000 farmers availed of it. In 2001, 836 people applied for the scheme but the number who applied for it in 2004 decreased to 321. The main question is why was that the case and we must get to the bottom of that.We need a root and branch review, rather than a scrapping, of the early retirement scheme, including increasing the income limit which is set at €25,500. That income limit was fair when the scheme was introduced 11 years ago but in today's terms a farmer would not gain any of the benefits applying in this area by participating in this scheme as one of the transferees. Such a farmer would lose stamp duty benefits etc. I ask that this aspect be reviewed.We must respect the right of a farmer to decide when he or she wants to retire. We must also respect the Lisbon competitiveness agreement. These are elements we cannot ignore. We must balance those with having in place a fair early retirement scheme which will provide retired farmers with an income on which they can live. I am sure the Minister would agree it is not correct not to index link pensions. An income of €13,500 was probably in order 11 years ago but one need only reflect on a farmer retiring on a salary of €13,500 and what that income would buy in five or six years' time. That aspect must be examined.There are key barriers to farmers taking up this scheme, including that the pension is not index-linked and the need to increase the income limits. We must also encourage young people to participate in farming — 12% of farmers are under the age of 35 and that is not a good basis for going forward.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Deputy has nearly answered the argument he put forward. That is the reason I put out this idea, although I would not say I am stirring the pot.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Minister is definitely stirring the pot.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Foresight is 20/20. Therefore, we must evaluate the scheme. I agree that its usefulness when introduced was tremendous. However, the decrease from 10,000 to 2,599 farmers to date participating in the scheme represents a major gap. It poses the question why are farmers not interested in participating in the scheme. There are a number of reasons, including that the pension is not index-linked. That feature is part of the scheme. Furthermore, the fact that the Government has introduced a good social welfare pension — I had to get my spoke in there — means that the scheme is not as attractive as it was initially for farmers.I want to introduce a proper balance between two elements. I want to encourage young people to go into farming. Is the early retirement scheme the best mechanism for achieving that? Is there a better mechanism we need to introduce to support young farmers? I have put forward that idea and I welcome hearing what farmers have to say on it. Given that there is also the notion that we should not encourage people to retire at 55 years of age, but encourage them to remain in work until they reach the age of 65, and that we want to achieve a balance between younger and older people engaged in farming, is there an alternative view to the current scheme? Many people aged 55 still have major responsibilities at home, including providing for children at college, and they cannot afford to retire. Therefore, we need to strike a balance. I am not proposing a scrapping of the scheme but perhaps aspects of it need to be modified and other aspects should be maintained, and new initiatives should be considered. I have put forward this idea to establish what people have to say about it and whether the current scheme is the right way forward.This is a small scheme and some people are disgruntled about it because it is not index-linked. My two colleagues opposite are smiling as if this aspect of this scheme will make me uncomfortable but it will not. The bottom line is that this is not an index-linked scheme, nor are many other schemes introduced between the European Union and ourselves. If people have novel ideas or consider that the scheme could be improved, now, rather than later, is the time to review it.

The fact that it has not been revamped is the reason farmers are not taking up the scheme. It is important for agriculture in the next five to ten years that we review this scheme. It provides a method of encouraging young farmers to remain in farming.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I have already made it clear that the Commission's proposals for reform of the EU sugar regime, which were published on 22 June, are unacceptable in their present form. The key elements of the proposals are a 39% price cut in the institutional price for sugar, a corresponding reduction in the minimum price for sugar beet and 60% compensation to farmers for the price cut. A voluntary restructuring scheme is proposed to encourage factory closures and the renunciation of quota.While the need for reform of the EU sugar regime is acknowledged, I consider that the Commission's proposals are unbalanced, go beyond the principles of previous CAP reforms and could lead to drastic consequences for the sugar beet industry in a number of member states, including Ireland. This is an unprecedented situation in terms of CAP reform proposals presented by the Commission for any sector.I expressed my serious concerns about the proposals when I met with Commissioner Fischer Boel on her visit to Ireland in June, and again at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July. I emphasised that the price cuts proposed are too severe, that the reforms should be based on a longer lead-in time for the Everything But Arms agreement and that it would be preferable to await the outcome of the WTO meeting in Hong Kong in December before seeking to conclude an agreement on sugar reform. I have also continued to remain in contact with like-minded colleague Ministers from other member states who are opposed to the reform proposals.My overall objective is to ensure a more balanced agreement, which will take Irish interests into account. The proposals will be considered by the Council again on 24-25 October and given their severity, it is clear that the negotiations will continue to be difficult.

We would all acknowledge that the proposals, as framed, are unacceptable. While the Minister has expressed to the Commission that these proposals are unacceptable and that she wants steps taken to change them, has she put forward formal proposals in this regard? Has she discussed formal proposals with her fellow colleagues who would form a blocking minority in order that we can get unanimous support across those ten member states for putting forward a case? The Minister might elaborate on that.Who owns the sugar quota? Legal advice on this matter is being considered for the past 18 months. Surely at this stage the Minister has an answer on this matter.In regard to the proposed compensation, will the State will hand over such compensation to a company such as Greencore, given that the vast majority of its operations are now based in the UK, or what mechanism will the Minister use to hand over any such compensation that may come down the line from the Commission?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I have continued to speak to my colleagues over the summer. I will shortly meet my colleague from Italy where the implications for sugar are equally severe. We have not had a bilateral meeting yet with either the Commission or the Presidency. I hope to do that on the Monday night of the Council meeting. The high level group of officials will meet the Commission to discuss this matter on Thursday. I will not submit a negotiating proposal until such time as I have evaluated the outcome of that. However, the Group of Ten will also meet on the Monday night prior to the Council, where we will discuss the methodology for dealing with this issue. A strategic balanced approach and the timeframe will be very important.On the issue of ownership, the Commission has confirmed that the quota is not an asset. Accordingly, it is not owned by anybody. It is simply a mechanism for regulating the market and this is confirmed by our legal advice from the Attorney General. One of the proposals is that if a sugar factory closes, the quota will be quenched. That means there would be no production in the country in question and this is a matter for EU compensation. Such EU compensation would come from a levy on the other sugar factories that remain in production. It has nothing to do with the Irish State. However, I hope I do not find myself in such a situation. The negotiations on this will be very difficult.I have taken the opportunity to meet a number of stakeholders and national and local representatives in the affected counties in the region. I will take every opportunity at diplomatic level among my ministerial colleagues to put together what I believe will be a more balanced approach. To bring this to finality prior to Hong Kong would be the wrong decision. The matter would be pocketed, in effect, and we would get no credit for any work done. That is my major concern prior to the World Trade Organisation talks.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Is it not the case that any compensation that may come at some future date will be funded through the Government? In the context of what we now know, was it not a major mistake to close the Carlow plant prematurely, as happened earlier this year? When did the Minister meet the Spanish authorities on this issue?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	As I said, this will be paid for through a levy on existing sugar producing factories from throughout the European Community. National funding will not be involved.The Deputy asked about the Spanish authorities. I met the Spanish Minister for Agriculture, Ms Elena Espinosa, the last time I attended a Council meeting, which was three weeks ago. As regards meetings with officials, unfortunately the Spaniards have changed their secretary general. However, there will be a further meeting of officials at that level when the new appointment is made.As regards the closure of Carlow, I am not in a position to put forward the view of Greencore. As the Deputy knows, it is a publicly quoted company listed on the Stock Exchange. In my view Greencore made its decision on the basis of the initial publication from the European Commission of its view on reform of the sugar regime. Ultimately we are all agreed there needs to be reform of the regime. It will impact not only on Ireland and the European Community but also on developing countries who have put forward their case vociferously to the Council. Their viewpoints must be taken on board as well. We are not reviewing just one aspect of agriculture but are taking into consideration quite a number of pieces which are part of the puzzle. It will not be easy to put it together.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Deputy will be aware that we already have in place a full identification, traceability and labelling system for beef under comprehensive EU regulations. The labelling requirements under those regulations extend up to and including retail level and to the point of delivery into hotels, restaurants and catering establishments.My priority in this area is to extend the existing beef labelling laws to require information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to all consumers in the restaurant and catering sectors. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, put specific proposals to Government at the end of June for a legislative framework to facilitate this, by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. This will be introduced under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 which is before the Oireachtas this session. The appropriate regulations are being worked on concurrently and I intend to have these cleared at EU level as soon as possible. When the Act is amended and the regulations made, country of origin information will be available to consumers in respect of all beef served in restaurants, hotels and the whole catering sector in Ireland on a mandatory basis.In the meantime the various representative bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and both of the vintners' groups, following discussions with my Department, have all agreed to recommend to their members the introduction on a voluntary basis and in advance of the mandatory legal requirement of a mechanism for providing consumers in their premises with information on the country of origin of the beef served there. This agreement was finalised last week and these organisations are at various stages in the process. I expect the voluntary system will be in place soon.During the discussions with the industry representatives, it was stressed that the information on the origin of the beef served or supplied on their premises must be clearly displayed at the point of consumption, either on the menu or on a poster, chalk board or similar display so that it can be easily read and clearly understood by all consumers. The information must include all countries from which the premises is sourcing its beef and all statements of origin must be verifiable and be capable of linkage with the delivery records to the establishment. When the legislation is enacted, the necessary enforcement provisions will be through the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I welcome the progress proposed in the forthcoming legislation. It is long overdue. There have been serious concerns as regards imported beef and these continue. We hope that this will be the final initiative in terms of identification, labelling and traceability for the beef industry at least. It is necessary for consumer confidence and as a support for the industry.I appreciate that it is voluntary for the moment. While I welcome its introduction, will there by any monitoring to ensure that what the restaurants are telling us will be put in place on a voluntary basis will be put in place?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I record our appreciation for the positive approach of the various representative groups to the voluntary code. Bord Bia will work with the relevant representative associations to ensure the scheme works as well as possible. It will be proposed in the legislation that all meats will be included so that meat from sheep, pigs and poultry will be covered as well. The immediate priority is to extend the existing beef labelling system, which is the most comprehensive. We are determined to have that legislation brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas during this term with the co-operation of the Dáil and the Seanad.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland's national action programme under the directive was formally submitted to the European Commission by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 29 July 2005. The next step is for the Minister to make regulations to give legal effect to the action programme. My Department, supported by Teagasc, has been assisting the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in finalising these regulations. I expect the Minister of that Department to publish the draft regulations shortly for public consultation.The final but extremely important stage of the process is for Ireland to secure a derogation from the general organic nitrogen limits in the directive so that farmers can operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. My Department and Teagasc developed the derogation proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There have been preliminary discussions with the Commission about the derogation application and I will be pressing strongly to have these discussions concluded as early as possible in 2006.To help farmers meet their obligations under the action programme, I am seeking approval from the European Commission for significant improvements in the farm waste management scheme. These include increasing the grant rate from 40% to 60% and to 70% in the counties in Zone C, a top-up of 5% to 10% for young farmers, higher investment ceilings and the extension of the scheme to the pig and poultry sectors.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The nitrates directive was introduced in 1992, yet farmers still have no idea where they stand. The Minister stated grant aid for waste management purposes will be introduced by 1 January 2006 but did not indicate whether or when the derogation permitting the use of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare.In light of a recent breakthrough in the area of pig manure as a result of a decision of a Spanish court, has the Minister re-examined the use of pig and poultry manure as fertiliser? As she and my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, are aware, pig and poultry are among the most important industries in Counties Cavan and Monaghan and the Border region in general. Has the Minister examined the implications of the court case? The ruling makes clear that pig and poultry manure are classified as fertiliser as opposed to waste. Will the Minister consider changing so-called waste management grants to manure or fertiliser storage grants and treat these important pig and poultry by-products in the appropriate manner? Will she also ensure that the greatest possible amount of these products can be spread on other farms without imposing excessive red tape? Does she accept the Commission's contention that excessive red tape must be eliminated?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I am surprised the Deputy did not thank me for recognising the significant implications of my proposals for his constituency and deciding to increase grant aid. He did, however, reflect——

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The Deputy will see it in January.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The issue is before the European Commission. It is my intention to activate the scheme from the beginning of next year when applications will be sought. In the period prior to Commission approval being given, those preparing to develop new facilities should make appropriate preparations, for example, securing the necessary planning permissions.The derogation would be important for approximately 10,000 dairy farmers. It was on that basis that the Department initiated discussions with the Commission prior to the initial action plan being agreed. I am anxious to deal with this issue in its entirety as quickly as possible. While we can revisit history and what has been done since 1992, recriminations will not sort out the issue. No side, whether the farming fraternity, Government Departments or political parties, was eager to progress the issue. Hindsight, as the Deputy will be aware, is 20/20. The grant aid has been introduced in recognition that the directive will have implications for farmers. I am delighted the scheme we have proposed to the Commission gives greater recognition to small farmers. The directive's implications are as important for small farmers as for larger farmers, a fact reflected in the decision to increase the investment ceiling to €120,000. The Department has tried to strike a balance between the interests of small and large farmers.On the classification of the scheme, I agree the use of the word "waste" is counter-productive. Pig and poultry manure is regarded as an asset rather than a waste and on that basis the Department is investigating new technologies and methodologies for dealing with it. This will also involve examining further proposals to support the sector.The outcome of the recent Spanish court case is being evaluated. However, an initial examination indicates that it does not have major implications for Ireland. That said, the matter has not been definitively addressed and the Department is continuing to examine its implications.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I am aware both of the confirmation of BSE in an animal born in Wales in 2002 and the reports of BSE being transmitted in an experimental sheep flock in the United Kingdom. There are no particular implications for Ireland as a result of either incident.To date, 16 cases of BSE have been confirmed here in animals born after 1998, the most recent of which had a registered date of birth of March 2001. Similarly, the reports of BSE in a sheep flock, while informative, have no particular implications for BSE policy here.The occurrence of BSE in animals born after 1998 does not detract from the decline in the incidence of the disease here and throughout the European Union. The epidemiological evidence here and in the United Kingdom suggests that a tight control on the use of mammalian meat and bone meal plays a significant role in reducing the incidence of the disease. It has been suggested in the UK that these cases may be related to imported feed as the controls in place in Ireland and the UK since 1996 were not introduced EU-wide until 2000. Given the incubation period for BSE, we will, at EU level, have to wait several more years before the full effect of the complete ban on the use of processed animal proteins can be measured.Apart from the aforementioned case in the UK, no case of BSE has been identified in the EU sheep population despite the fact that testing, which is capable of discriminating BSE from scrapie, is now mandatory throughout the EU. Were such a case to be identified here consideration would have to be given to how to deal with the affected flock and the progeny of the affected animal. Although a case of BSE has been confirmed in a single goat in France, no such cases have been experienced in Ireland and should such a case be confirmed here decisions about control measures would have to be taken. The Department continues to operate a range of controls at various locations to protect public health and eradicate BSE and scrapie.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I thank the Minister for her reply. While we all welcome the decline in the overall number of reported cases of BSE, does the Minister not consider it a cause of grave concern that 16% of the animals identified this year as carrying the disease were born after the ban on the use of processed animal proteins was introduced? Two of the animals in question were five years old. Seven other animals identified as having BSE by August this year were born after the ban was introduced. Therefore, a substantial number of animals identified this year as having BSE were born after the introduction of the ban. What research or investigations are the Department carrying out on this development?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Sixteen animals born after 1997 have been diagnosed with BSE, of which four were born in 1998, seven in 1999, three in 2000 and two in 2001. A further ten cases were confirmed in animals born in 1997 but a number of these were born before the full range of control measures was in place. The Department carries out an investigation into each of the comparatively small number of cases of animals which were born after the introduction of the ban on the use of animal proteins in feed being identified as having BSE. These cases are examined by my Department with support from outsourced expertise.While the Department has not yet reached a definitive conclusion on the reason these cases have occurred, it has been advised by scientific experts at European level that sporadic outbreaks of the disease are likely to persist. In some cases, presumably the earliest, evidence of spicules was found in or around the farmyard in question. These occurred after Ireland introduced a ban on the use of animal proteins in feed but before the European Union issued an EU wide ban. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland introduced a ban in 1996 or 1997 but some other countries did not follow suit until 2000. There was, therefore, an interregnum.A comparison of the number of cases of BSE identified between January and September this year and January and September last year shows the figure fell from 96 to 50, a significant reduction.

We are doing everything we can to ascertain if there are particular issues as to why this occurs. However, I have been advised that there will always be sporadic incidents and that is reflected in the UK also.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I accept there will be sporadic incidents but I would be interested to know if anybody has done a geographical audit on the areas where BSE has occurred. These are not just sporadic incidents. Such an audit might be worthy of consideration.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Given the concerns raised by Deputy Johnny Brady yesterday on the MRSA superbug being passed on by veterinarians to the beef cattle herd, what is the danger involved? What precautions will the Minister take to ensure that this deadly disease is not passed on to the food chain by the veterinarians carrying the MRSA superbug? It is a dangerous and serious disease. If it reaches humans through the food chain, it will be more serious than the BSE crisis.

Many farmers and organisations, such as those we met in her county last week, raised this issue. They feel that only the affected animal or related animals should be culled. Is a change likely in that area?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	95	A number of issues have been raised. On Deputy Upton's question, we have looked at the geographical spread. There have been investigations and last week there was a prosecution for an illegal animal knackery circumventing the controls. Where issues outside of the scientific aspects arise, the Department deals with them strictly.I did not get a copy of the press release on MRSA to which Deputy James Breen referred but I sympathise with people who have suffered from MRSA. It is a considerable imposition on them. Perhaps the Deputy and I could discuss the issue afterwards and I will certainly raise it on his behalf.There is evidence that perhaps the necessity of a cull has outweighed its usefulness. That being said, I have noticed that every time we try to pull back from the precautionary measures brought forward, we find something else. The strictness of the regime is such that we are in a position to be strong in our export markets. As we are trying to enter even more markets, that strict control mechanism may need to continue for some time but it is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Minister of State may remember that on the Land Bill 2004 I raised an important question on Land Commission land being handed back to county councils. He has taken on board my suggestion, which was supported by Deputy Naughten and others, that county councils would not just sell this land off on the open market to the highest bidder because it was made available for the ordinary people to feed a cow and a calf. If any change is being made in that regard or if such land is not being made available for recreation facilities for GAA clubs, soccer clubs etc., much of this land could be suitable for social housing or affordable housing, in particular, for young couples, some of whom may be returning to the country and whose families would have availed of this land in the past.I ask that sites would be made available for such people. I hope the Minister of State will take that into consideration. He indicated to me that it would form part of the Bill, that this land could not be sold off and that such people would be facilitated if at all possible.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I agree with Deputy Brady. He has spoken and written to us and raised it on Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Land Bill 2004. The first time I heard the terms cow plots and cow parks was when they were used by Deputy Brady in this context. I assure the Deputy that these properties, if they should change hands, will be used for the common good, for public good and community use. There will be no case of such properties being sold or local authorities being allowed sell them to people to make profit. They will be for the public good and that will be copperfastened in the legislation. Report Stage of the Land Bill 2004 will be before this House next week.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	104	According to Central Statistics Office data there were a total of 147,600 farmers in 1997, of which 98,300 or 67% were classified as full-time or farmers having no other occupation. By 2003, the latest year that such data are available, the total number of farmers had fallen by 8% to 135,300. Of this number, 77,900 or 58% were classified as full-time or having no other occupation.While the decline in total farmer numbers has been relatively modest at approximately 1% per annum, the decline in the number of full-time farmers is more substantial. This reflects an ongoing trend as increasing number of farmers opt to choose a combination of on-farm and off-farm employment. This trend towards part-time farming reflects a number of both push and pull factors, including low incomes on small farms and the much greater availability of off-farm employment. In recent years many farmers have opted to supplement their incomes from off-farm sources while continuing to farm successfully.Both full and part-time farmers make important contributions to the rural economy. While the decoupling of direct payments will provide farmers with more flexibility and freedom, a clear focus on production costs and their optimal level of production will be critical to maintaining the viability of all farm holdings.The Agri-Vision 2015 committee indicated in its report that it believes the trend to part-time farming will continue. Many smaller farmers find that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure the viability of their holdings. At the same time, full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises.This Government is committed to maintaining the greatest number of family farms through the development of competitive full-time farming, while at the same time providing an economic environment which enables smaller farmers to avail of both on and off-farm opportunities to secure their future.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Is there sufficient input into alternative farm enterprises to encourage farmers who for whatever reason might have given up their previous type of farming and would be looking to some alternatives that would give them the opportunity to stay and earn a viable income on the land? Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on ensuring adequate and appropriate alternative employment in rural areas for part-time farmers?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Alternative farming is certainly now an option on the basis of decoupling and I note a slight trend in that direction such as specialisation in the free range area. We are doing all we can to encourage organic farming. This is a difficult task but every effort is being made to encourage it. On the basis of REPS, for example, we were in a position to give opportunities to people who wish to get involved in organic farming and not have their full farm considered as part of the REPS application. Alternatives are certainly being provided.This is being complemented by work being done by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. He is working with me on Leader, CLÁR and a number of existing options as opposed to those provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Much work parallel to that under the rural development directive, which has now been signed off, will provide those alternatives and support off-farm income. Growth in farmers' markets has given added impetus to farmers to produce for such markets and other alternative areas. We now need to drive forward the opportunities that are there.

As the Minister knows well, the majority of those farmers have been forced to supplement their income because they cannot make a basic living from agriculture. Is the reason Teagasc now puts forward figures on whole household income on farms, rather than farm income, an effort to cook the books in that regard?What measures are being taken to try to address the situation where retailers dictate the farm gate price farmers receive for their product? At the ploughing championships over the past week, farmers told me that viability is the key issue for them. What are the Minister's plans for the modulation fund and how will these be communicated to farmers?

While the household survey will indicate one result, the farm survey will indicate another. If I remember correctly, the farm survey shows a 3% increase in farm incomes. The policies we now pursue recognise the different types of farming taking place. I am delighted the Deputy took the opportunity to attend the ploughing championships.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Directive 2004/28 of the Council and of the European Parliament, which is the new EU legislation governing the veterinary medicines regime, must be transposed into national law no later than 30 October of this year. My Department has circulated draft regulations designed to give effect to the new EU legislation and to reform aspects of the existing national regime for consultation. Written submissions have been received from most of the stakeholders. My Department has also subsequently met many of these stakeholders as part of the consultative process. In addition, as required by the relevant legislation, the animal remedies consultative committee will meet shortly to consider the draft regulations, following which I will make final decisions on the issues involved so that the regulations can be brought into force by the transposition deadline.I am aware of the concerns expressed that some veterinary medicines that may currently be purchased from pharmacies will require a veterinary prescription following adoption of these regulations. The position on this issue is as follows. While the directive provides that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals must be subject to prescriptions, it also includes a provision for exemption criteria to be adopted at EU level that will provide a mechanism for certain categories of medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement. The EU has not yet adopted a decision on the exemption criteria but must do so before 1 January 2007. Pending this decision, existing national prescription and distribution arrangements may remain in place. As I indicated in a previous reply, I will consult on this and make a decision in due course.

The United Kingdom has proceeded differently on the black market. We must ensure competition and people must not feel under pressure that their choice will be restricted.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	122	It is well known the Taoiseach has a history of signing blank cheques. The latest episode of the blank cheque written for the PPARS system is his most spectacular to date, at least of those we know about. I expect many Government members will say they know little about the PPARS system. The personnel, payroll, and related systems software project was set up in 1998 with a budget of €9 million, to be completed in three years. Seven years later the project has already cost €150 million. Some €70 million of that was paid to consultants and I understand that €50 million of that €70 million was paid to one consultancy firm.What has the public got for its €150 million? We have a system that applies only to 37,000 staff members out of 130,000. It has not been rolled out nationally among the staff to whom the PPARS system applies. There has been widespread dissatisfaction with the system, as announced today by the Irish Nurses Organisation. This system paid one member €1 million in error, and consistently made overpayments to other members for several weeks. In the flagship hospital, St. James's, which has been involved in PPARS from the outset, the chief executive has indicated that his hospital does not want to continue with the project as it threatens the hospital's basic functioning, its credibility and its relationships with its workforce.I have two questions for the Taoiseach and his Government. First, how the hell did the Government spend €150 million on this botched project and how did he as Taoiseach, with three Ministers for Health and Children over the past seven years, preside over this scandalous episode of Government incompetence? Second, who does he hold responsible for this debacle and what action does he propose to take on it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I will just touch on some of the issues. The PPARS system started off first in the mid 1990s when the health boards decided they needed a better payroll system because they did not even know how many people were working for them at the time. They looked at setting up a payroll system for a number of the health boards at the time and the estimated cost was €9 million or €10 million. Early estimates changed over the three-year period from 1998 to 2000 to €17 million. The highly respected Hay organisation undertook a full appraisal and review of the level of investment that would be required to finish the project properly, during its transition from a payroll system to a whole human resource management system that would be unlike what was envisaged or presented at the outset. The initial payroll system became a system dealing with personal information, pension payments, recruitment, time management and rostering. It became an entirely different system. The Deputy's suggestion that the projected cost of the system increased from €10 million to €150 million is erroneous and unfair and should not be entertained.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The organisation also suggested that the system would lead to a reduction in staff turnover and would facilitate cost avoidance systems. The health boards tried to pull all of this together. An international IT consultancy group, Gardner, was commissioned in July 2004 to examine where the project was then. The group's report indicated that although spending was in line with the level outlined by the Hay organisation three years earlier, the costs were rising. The Gardner group wrote to the project team outlining some of these issues. The reality is that the system being put in place to replace the payroll system was quite complex because it dealt with many matters relating to 140,000 members of staff and a payroll of €7 billion. The Hay organisation pointed out that if the system had been put in place correctly for €150 million, it would be a ten-year system dealing with approximately €70 billion. If it had worked correctly, that would have been fine. Unfortunately, just 40,000 of the 140,000 health service personnel have been brought under the system. It has been suggested that it would cost €55 million to finish the system by the end of March 2006. I know the sums sometimes come as a problem to Deputy Kenny——

Some €116 million was spent up to the end of last year. It would cost another €55 million, more than €20 million of which would be a staff cost, to finish the system in its entirety. Unfortunately, if 100 people work on a system, one must pay them. That might be a difficulty for Fine Gael, but on this side of the House we believe in paying public servants.

There have been three Ministers for Health and Children — Deputy Cowen, Deputy Martin and Deputy Harney — during the seven years in which the Taoiseach has sat in the Taoiseach's chair. They approved the budget for the system under discussion on an annual basis. They knew of and approved the increases in the Department of Health and Children's capital budget for IT facilities for the various health boards. Although they approved the increases, they are now shedding responsibility for them. It seems that the taps have been turned on in every Department, because a great deal of hand-washing is taking place. It is the same old story. Nobody on the Government side is willing to accept responsibility for anything, but they will dance to the tune of every PR firm in the country when it is necessary to open this, that and the other.

Why was the system not designed with the needs of those who will use it in mind? Can the Taoiseach confirm that contracts were sent out with the tender documentation, saying what the Department had estimated in the first place, what it wanted from the system and the conditions that applied to it? What were the incentives? What were the penalties that were to apply if the system was not delivered on time? Is it not a fact that officials from the Department of Finance, after a single meeting, raised serious concerns about the services being provided by one consultant? They said that if the consultant's focus was to be at the detailed level, the average day rate was inappropriate. The Taoiseach is aware that the average day rate for trainees is between €1,000 and €3,000 per day. That means that the firm in question is paid €70,000per diem. The Taoiseach is standing over that botched system, which deals with just one third of the workforce of the health service, without any sense of responsibility.

The Minister for Health and Children of the day and the Taoiseach as the leader of the Government of the day should have accepted responsibility. None of those things happened, however. The Taoiseach cannot walk away from his responsibility in this regard. He cannot shove it over to Professor Drumm and the HSE. The €150 million spent on it would have delivered a brand new 60-bed hospital. It could have been spent on doubling the home help budget, thereby providing a valuable community service to elderly people and people with disabilities. If the €150 million had been spent where it matters most, it could have been used to make a real difference to waiting lists in accident and emergency departments, for example. The Government should have ensured that it got value for the money provided by the people through their taxes, but instead there has been a shameful waste of taxpayers' money.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The HSE is conducting a review of the system, as planned and put together over the past seven or eight years, to see whether it is capable within a reasonable cost of providing a modern management system for the health service's 140,000 staff and its annual payroll of €7 billion. The details of just 40,000 staff have been placed on the system to date. It has been estimated that a further €55 million will be required to complete the project. That the HSE is trying to use a manual system and a computerised system at the same time has caused a large part of the problem. The huge variations between the systems in place in the 11 health boards which were brought together to form the HSE has led to this problem. It has not yet proved possible to solve that in an easy way. The system was evaluated. It is incorrect for the Deputy to say it was not evaluated properly in the first place. The ICT system in question——

The system was extended considerably after the procurement process was completed. The Hay report stated that considerable savings could accrue if the system could be made to work. Modern organisations require top-class systems. The system in question is used here by several multinational businesses.

Last October and again this year, the Health Service Executive, with officials of the Department of Finance, stated several times through the news media that it was reviewing the system. It does not intend to dump the system; it is reviewing it to see whether it can find another way to add the remaining numbers. It is a major problem that requires a modern single system that can deal with the payroll for 140,000 staff. Nobody will dump on the HSE. The Government will work with the HSE to try to improve the health service.

I accept there is probably nothing wrong with the PPARS technology. The problem is with the implementation of the technology, which is the Taoiseach's responsibility. No matter how much he wriggles and tries to avoid and evade his responsibility, it is his responsibility. He and the Government are responsible for gross incompetence and for squandering millions of euro in the health service that is desperately needed elsewhere. Regrettably, it is not just the PPARS system that is not working. When we consider the record of his appointed Minister for Health and Children after 12 months, it is clear she is not working either.I invite the Taoiseach to examine the analysis of the 12 month record of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children which the Labour Party published today. She promised to deal with the accident and emergency crisis; it is now worse than ever. She promised 30,000 full medical cards; not one of those cards has been issued. She promised 200,000 general practitioner only cards, which were to be provided last April; not one of those cards has been issued. During her term of office, every piece of accountability has been stripped out of the health service. We cannot even get an answer to a Parliamentary Question.

That is the record of the Minister for Health and Children appointed by the Taoiseach. Old folks in nursing homes, waiting for the money which was robbed from them, are told they will have to wait until next year, despite previously being told they would get it this autumn. Despite all the urgency expressed with regard to the Leas Cross issue, when the Taoiseach and Tánaiste were going to do the devil and all, what has happened? Nothing has happened. The legislation is not in place to deal with the central issues in the health service.When will the Taoiseach get his act together? When will the Government stop squandering money and appoint somebody who can do the job to the position of Minister for Health and Children?

The HSE is endeavouring to solve this. Whether it is exactly this system or an alternative system, or the system that applies to 40,000 staff, with some change to the system for the other 100,000 staff, it is vital a coherent system is found. The HSE has used an EU evaluation system and the best consultants in the country — the Hay organisation and others — to try to achieve this.

The HSE will continue to produce the cards. As the House knows, if we had issued the cards without finding industrial relations agreement——

The Tánaiste has continued all this year to implement the ten-point plan for accident and emergency services. Most of those initiatives are well under way. All of them are assisting in improving accident and emergency services in hospitals throughout the country. An improvement is apparent in many accident and emergency departments in regard to infrastructure as well as staffing, consultant cover and nurses cover. I accept that problems remain in some of the accident and emergency departments. The Government, the Tánaiste and I are committed to working with the HSE and voluntary hospitals to try to improve those issues.On the legislation to enable payment to those who are entitled to a refund of funding, we have given a commitment on that. The necessary process to get that system in order is under way. Legislation will be passed and we will make those payments as soon as possible.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	That was a pretty lacklustre statement of confidence in the Minister for Health and Children. The Taoiseach has still not dealt with the issues with regard to the record of the past 12 months. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste could have issued 30,000 full medical cards six to nine months ago. Once they made that announcement and allocated the funding, members of the public could have had access to their doctor because they would have been covered by a medical card. It would not require any industrial relations negotiations. Those cards have still not issued to people who are on low incomes and in desperate need of them.The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children are responsible for that. However, nothing the Taoiseach said explains to the public how it is that the money is still in the coffers instead of out there, helping people to access health care. The Taoiseach should explain this to all the families who cannot afford to go to the chemist to get medication or go to the doctor when their children are sick. How is it that the Taoiseach is denying people access to health care when they need it and when we have one of the richest economies in the world? It is an extraordinary indictment of the Government. Nothing the Taoiseach said gives any confidence to the public that he knows anything about the needs of the health service and patients.

That is how the system has always worked.Some 1,149,000 people are covered by medical cards, a situation which improves day by day. Moreover, the Tánaiste has made changes never before made by any Minister for Health and Children. If the Deputy wants me to give glowing praise to the Tánaiste, I certainly will, because she introduced the changes on child care——

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Last week the Taoiseach said Irish Ferries was engaged in sharp practice in sacking 543 trade union workers and replacing them with exploited labour from eastern Europe. Was that not utterly empty lip-service from him as in the past 12 months it has emerged that his Government gave millions of euro to the same company, Irish Ferries, in redundancy grants to do exactly the same thing to 150 workers on the  MV Normandy? Can the Taoiseach explain the difference? Where was his indignation then?The conditions sought by Irish Ferries for their new workers can only be described as semi-bonded labour. They will slave for 84 hours per week, work for months on end with no break and eat and sleep in their workplace — the ship — for €3.50 per hour. That is a mere €3.50 more than the galley slaves of ancient Rome except, I am sure, if we were around in those days, the galley bosses would have saved us guff about obeying workers' rights. The reality is the naked greed evident here for profit from exploited labour places the moral standards of the likes of Irish Ferries somewhere between those of a slum landlord and a slave trader. Yet we are told 95% of all ships in and out of Irish waters have so-called contracted out labour.Why are ships flying banana boat flags of convenience allowed to ply EU waters with impunity after all the Taoiseach's talk of social charters, workers' rights and the rest of it during, for example, recent referenda? Is the answer that the policy of European big business, supported by governments like the Taoiseach's, is that migrant labour is there to be abused as is happening in front of the Taoiseach's eyes in the construction industry, the meat industry and in many other industries in order to maximise profit?Has IBEC — the bosses' organisation — not been exposed as the biggest, most blatant user of all flags of convenience called social partners when it obviously has no allegiance to it in backing Irish Ferries to the hilt? Will the Taoiseach introduce legislation to break this cycle of exploitation? Will it be a matter of urgency in this Dáil? Will the Taoiseach bring it to Europe to break the exploitation now rampant in European Union waters of vulnerable workers?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I dealt with this last week. As the Deputy knows, the flag of convenience has been used on the seas generally for many decades. It has been exploited far beyond Irish Ferries. In fact, Irish Ferries made the point to its workforce for the past number of years that it was one of the few companies not engaged in this practice and the reason it was arguing about its cost base was that so many others were engaged in this practice. This practice has been engaged in for a long time on the open seas. I do not know when it started but it certainly was not in recent decades.On 19 September Irish Ferries announced it had offered a voluntary severance package to 543 of its seafaring employees on its Irish Sea services between Dublin and Holyhead and Rosslare and Pembroke. An offer was made to any employees who wished to stay on. As the Deputy said, under those offers, there was a voluntary redundancy package of up to eight weeks' pay per year of service, including two weeks' statutory pay provided there was agreement with the company. Last week I said we were looking at the legalities of that. We raised it and we will talk to the trade union about it because if some people go, we must be careful we do not create difficulties for individual employees as well.The objection I have with the company is that it said it would replace these departing staff with crew from an agency employing cheaper eastern European personnel which many others on the seas do. The Government believes in an Irish labour context the action Irish Ferries took was sharp practice and totally unacceptable. The Deputy quoted me correctly in that regard.The national implementation body met last week and welcomed the invitation by the chairman of the Labour Court to the parties to meet separately in informal and exploratory talks. It recommended the parties respond positively to the court's invitation. I welcome the fact the company and the unions met at the Labour Court yesterday and I urge all the parties to co-operate with the industrial relations machinery of the State because that is how this issue will be dealt with.For the Deputy's information, the preliminary advice received from the Attorney General as to whether a statutory redundancy situation exists was that on the basis of the information available it may not fall within the definition of the Redundancy Payments Acts. No formal communication as yet has been received from Irish Ferries, so the discussions go on.If there is a requirement for changes to legislation in this regard, obviously the relevant Department will look at some of the issues arising. However, we have made our points very clearly to IBEC which I think accepts them, as does the company. The Deputy knows the impracticality of saying these companies which face change and opposition should never make anyone redundant. The reality is we are in a situation where normal industrial relations are being followed, which I welcome. We should leave the discussions to take place where they rightly should, that is, in the Labour Court.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	211	So-called normal industrial relations means the Labour Court. In the case of the MV Normandy, the Labour Court, if I might paraphrase it, said flags of convenience are all the rage and it could do nothing about it. It recommended that the deal had to be accepted. It was exactly the same thing. Some 150 workers on trade union rates of pay and conditions were replaced by cheap, agency labour. That is what happened on the MV Normandy and the Taoiseach’s Government paid millions of euro to supplement that. What is the difference? Will the Taoiseach explain it when he responds?The Taoiseach said flags of convenience have been used for many decades. That is an indictment of his Government and his fellow governments in the European Union. It shows ship workers that they must rely on their own strength. Should they not fight this campaign to drag down their wages and conditions with effective strike action to paralyse companies like Irish Ferries until they agree to continue to employ workers on trade union rates of pay and decent working conditions? When ship workers in France and other countries face the same thing, should they not join together with them to ensure it happens?Where does this leave the concept of so-called partnership? Why should workers have any sense of belief that bosses who do this type of thing to them are their partners? In what sense can they be said to be their partners? When the Taoiseach said IBEC and Irish Ferries "now accept", is he saying they have accepted they will not sack those 543 workers? Have they given him that assurance?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I am trying to help to resolve a situation in Irish Ferries and not to create a problem in other companies. Government policy has always been that Irish seafaring employment is maximised for its own sake so that Ireland can develop and grow its maritime sector. The loss of significant Irish seafaring employment in Irish Ferries would be a significant blow. That is why we are trying to avoid that happening. We need to ensure matters are progressed in a manner that does not lead to disruption of transport services. I do not think the Deputy is serious but if he believes closing the seas of Europe would, in some way, help the Irish workforce, he has another think coming to him.On the Deputy's last point, the very fact there is social partnership means we can engage with workers and employers. If we went back to the old way, we know what would happen. They would just close, there would be nobody to talk to and they would move on. The fact social partnership is in place means workers can use it as a basis to get——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	It is proposed to take No. 13, Supplementary Estimate for public services [Vote 31], back from committee; No. 14, motion re membership of committees; No. 15, Railway Safety Bill 2001 — instruction to committee; No. 20, statements on Corrib gas field; and No. 21, Railway Safety Bill 2001 — Order for Report, Report and Final Stages.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted on the adjournment of Private Members' business which shall be No. 48, motion re report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2004, which shall be taken for 90 minutes at 7 p.m. or on the conclusion of No. 20, whichever is the later; Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, shall be decided without debate and, in the case of No. 13, Supplementary Estimate for public services [Vote 31], any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; the proceedings on No. 20 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after two hours and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statements of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.

Is the proposal for the late sitting and the taking of Private Members' Business agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, motions re Supplementary Estimate for public services, membership of committees and the Railway Safety Bill 2001, agreed?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	It is not agreed. It is not the first time the Green Party has opposed an Estimate being taken in this way. In this case, we oppose it because the relevant committee has not made a report on the Estimate. The House is being asked to accept it without the consultation the Government would like people to believe is in place. It is important because we are not seeing what we are asked to accept. The relevant committee and the House needs to have a full report on this Estimate. It is not acceptable or responsible simply to nod it through without seeing to what we are agreeing.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I note from the Government's legislation programme that under section B, Bills for which texts are being prepared, none of the proposed legislation is expected to be published until mid-2006. In respect of the planning and development (strategic national infrastructure) Bill, will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government make a clarifying statement arising from his meeting with the hauliers' association? I know this is a sideways fashion to ask this question. However, there are thousands of tractor owners with large trailers that cannot——

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	241	It was promised to introduce a Bill establishing the health information and quality authority alongside the legislation establishing the Health Service Executive, which was taken last December. However, the Bill never materialised. This legislation was to include an inspectorate of nursing homes. This, along with the repayments Bill to pay elderly people their money, is now listed under the section for Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by Government. The first stage of preparation of these Bills has not been completed. The introduction of these Bills to the House is a moveable feast.Will those entitled to get their money back see this legislation introduced and completed in the House this year? Will the people who saw the great concern expressed by the Taoiseach when the Leas Cross nursing home was in the media see the legislation on the inspectorate of nursing homes introduced to the House this year, as was promised by him?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The heads of the health (nursing homes)(amendment) Bill have been approved by the Government.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	It is hoped the Bill will be introduced in this session. However, the Tánaiste made it clear last week that it will not be finished in this session.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	248	It will be published but we will not have finished it. Regarding the Bill establishing the health information and quality authority, last year the Tánaiste decoupled it, so to speak, from what is now the Health Act 2004 and it is now due next year. Work is under way on this legislation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Following the earlier debate on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, what progress has been made on legislation for a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children? In the North, similar legislation has made considerable progress while the South is paralysed on this matter.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Does the Deputy have a question on legislation? I remind the House two hours is promised for a debate. Only matters relevant to the Order of Business can be raised.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	251	Is it not possible to indicate the date of publication for this Bill? I expected it to have changed so that we could look forward to some date. With many students starting third level college this month, no date has been indicated for the publication of the third level student support Bill. Is the Department of Education and Science progressing this legislation?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	252	There is nothing new from what I said last week about the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children.I will ask for an update on the matter but I stated last week that the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children have discussed the establishment of a pre-employment consultancy service.As for the third level student support Bill, consultations are taking place between the Departments and the relevant stakeholders on that legislation. I understand those discussions will be helpful in creating better legislation. I do not have a date for that proposed Bill, but if the Deputy tables a question for the Minister, he will receive an outline of those discussions.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The Taoiseach will recall that the former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, promised we would be riding in the metro in 2005 and that the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, stated that we would be riding it in 2007. Wisely, the current Minister was a little more coy in his promises and has given a promise of a promise. In the legislative proposals, I notice——

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I have. I notice that the proposed metro Bill has entirely disappeared from the legislative list. Can the Taoiseach indicate what that means? Does it mean the metro has also disappeared or is this merely a sign of continued indecision? Does it mean the metro Bill is no longer required or will the metro ever be built?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The Bill has been included in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's proposed planning and development Bill, the strategic infrastructure Bill.

At present, there is scarcely another issue in this State, with the possible exception of the health service, that is more important. Therefore, I ask if the Government will provide time for this item to be debated. I draw the Taoiseach's attention to No. 64 on the Order Paper. It is a motion calling on the European Commission to bring forward a European ferries directive, which would effectively deal with the current crisis and the issue of ferry services and the exploitation of workers. Its central theme is workers' rights, not just in Irish Ferries, but in all ferry companies, in respect of——

I want to ask the Taoiseach about the infrastructural Bill. It was his pet project and four years ago, he presented it to IBEC as the key to solving infrastructural problems. What is happening to this Bill? Has he lost all interest in it or will it be accelerated as a key element of the Government's strategy?

We have 50 major infrastructural projects under way. The Deputy is aware of that and wherever such projects are not delivering, he has been supplied with answers to his parliamentary questions.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	367	In the last session we passed emergency legislation, namely, the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill 2005 and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) Bill 2005. Both Bills were enacted to address a loophole that had been exploited regarding the sale of State property on fee simple. An explanation is needed because a third instance occurred during the Dáil recess. Is it the intention of the Government to introduce further legislation in this area? Will it introduce all embracing legislation? It seems to be a problem that covers every State and semi-State agency.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I did not catch all of that. Is it about the British Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill?
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Yes, the Bill that was introduced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as well as the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) Bill introduced by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is about the sale of fee simple that allows State property to be bought at an undervalued price, due to a loophole in the law. We passed two Bills and the loophole still seems to exist. Will further legislation be introduced?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I will raise the issue. The British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill is already law, but the Deputy claims there is still a loophole.

I realise the court's decision is not as acute as before in this case. However, the matter has not been fully resolved in the courts and I ask Members to bear this in mind when making their contributions.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter, which has seen significant developments in recent days. I am delighted with these developments and they offer an opportunity for both sides to move forward.Over the past three months, I have been endeavouring to create the conditions that would allow this matter to be resolved. During that time, following contact through an intermediary with the five men, I ordered a full safety review of the Corrib onshore upstream pipeline. Subsequent to this, I increased the monitoring and supervision of the project. On 25 August 2005 I appointed Advantica consultants to conduct this safety review and recently I announced a public consultation process, including a two day public hearing in the locality to take place on 12 and 13 October.Deputies will recall that the Corrib issue was discussed in the House on a number of occasions last week. The Taoiseach commented on the matter during Leaders' Questions and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher also addressed the House on the issue. I dealt with this matter in some detail at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. All participants in these debates sought movement on the issue. Following the debates, I contacted both sides in an effort to break the impasse and indicated to them that the Government would appoint a mediator if both sides were willing to participate in a mediation process. I then called on both parties to create the conditions which would allow such a process to commence immediately. I am glad to report to the House that both sides responded positively to my initiative. It is my hope that the progress made to date, along with the appointment of a mediator, will allow all those concerned to participate fully in the public consultation process of the safety review and to work together to resolve the difficulties that have arisen.The safety review of the onshore upstream gas pipeline will be thorough and comprehensive and will be carried out by independent internationally recognised experts. Advantica, the successful bidder, is a world leader in the development and application of advanced hazard and risk assessment technologies for gas pipelines. This safety review will examine critically all relevant documentation relating to the design, construction and operation of the pipeline and associated facilities. Advantica has been asked to identify deficiencies, if any, with respect to safety and to make recommendations as to how these can be remedied.People who have views relating to the safety of the pipeline should have the opportunity to have those views considered by Advantica. Views are now being invited from local residents, communities and any interested party. Advantica staff have visited the Corrib site as part of their work and a two-day public hearing will be held in Mayo next week. The hearing will be chaired by John Gallagher S.C. This hearing is an opportunity for everyone who has concerns to clearly express those concerns and to ensure that all safety issues are brought to the attention of Advantica for full consideration.Some comments have been made that the safety review will not deal with the issue of proximity. This is untrue. No safety review could take place without full consideration of the issue of proximity. It is the issue which has been at the centre of genuine local concerns about the project. Advantica knows it is an issue which has to be dealt with fully and explicitly in its work. Another area of concern for local people is the ongoing safety of the pipeline if it was in place. It has been commented incorrectly that there is no State agency with specific responsibility for onshore upstream pipeline safety. This is quite simply untrue. I have specific powers with respect to the safety of the gas pipelines and I will use all legislative mechanisms available to me to ensure that safety in the installation and operation of such pipelines is being addressed and policed properly.In order to allay fears, there is a necessity to spell out more clearly the safety regime which will be in place before the first gas flows through the pipelines from the Corrib field. It is my intention, as outlined in the House last July, that a clear regime for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline will be in place. This will be an open and transparent system and will ensure the highest standards of safety will apply. Obviously, if Advantica puts forward any recommendations on these issues in its final report, I will take them fully into account in the preparation of the final consents.As the House is aware, both sides responded positively to my indication on Thursday last that the Government would appoint a mediator provided both sides were willing to respond positively. The response was positive, the injunction was lifted and the men were released. In consultation with both sides, I am now moving to identify a person or body who might be willing to undertake that work. It is my intention that by this weekend a list of possible mediators will be provided to both sides to establish their acceptability and to see if we can come up with an agreed name. As soon as that process is complete, the mediator will commence the work.Despite comments reported in the media from sources in the local community, I am satisfied that both sides are now adopting a very positive approach to resolving issues between them. For example, both sides co-operated fully in a visit to the site this morning. At the request of local people, two local people were given access to see the work being carried out by the developers. This is a very helpful development and I thank both sides for their co-operation. I hope we can continue in this constructive manner.I wish to take this opportunity to deal with the issue of the Corrib gas field in a more general manner. It is important to state clearly the factual and legal basis regarding the gas field. My Department is responsible for the regulatory aspects of petroleum exploration and development. Authorisations were granted for the Corrib gas field under a number of provisions. Under the Continental Shelf Act 1968, authorisation was given for the construction of the sub-sea facilities within the continental shelf designated areas. My predecessor also gave consent for the plan for the development of the field under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960. Under the Gas Act 1976, as amended, consent was given for the construction of a gas pipeline from the gas field through the offshore up to the terminal building. A foreshore licence was also granted under the Foreshore Acts.In accordance with EU directives, an environmental impact assessment was carried out and an environmental impact statement was submitted with each application for consent or approval. It has been suggested that the terminal be sited offshore. I can only deal with the reality, which is that the proposal made by the developer to my Department was for an on-shore terminal only. This on-shore terminal was considered by the developer to be the most appropriate. I understand that it is now becoming common practice to place terminals on-shore rather than at sea. After consideration of a number of sites of entry for the pipeline, the developers proposed to bring it ashore at Dooncarton in Broadhaven Bay. Their proposal, which has since been approved, was to run the pipeline for 9 km to the terminal site.That is the factual and legal position. Members of the House and some outside it have sought to broaden the debate to discuss our natural resources policy. I would be delighted to have a debate with the Opposition on this issue. I have previously outlined the three different options available to us to exploit our natural resources. First, we can leave the resources untouched; second, we can choose to spend taxpayer's money on offshore exploration; or, third, we can license the private sector to do so. Is anyone seriously suggesting that we would leave our natural resources in the ground and untouched?

Do people think the State should gamble as much as €20 million of taxpayer's money per well at odds of over 30:1? The remaining option left to the State is to license the private sector to undertake this risk and accrue the associated reward after a 25% tax take. The rationale behind the current terms is to encourage exploration in Irish waters. Despite the allegation that these terms are overly generous, there have been very low levels of exploration over the past 30 years. For example, this year no well will be drilled. That puts paid to Deputy Broughan's fourth option, of changing the terms and making them less attractive than they are at present.

I look forward to a constructive debate. It is clear that while the matter is by no means resolved and that difficulties remain which must be resolved, significant progress has been made which can be built on through the mediation process as well as the safety review and the public hearing. I look forward to this progress taking place in the coming weeks.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I am glad this debate is taking place. This has proven to be a most controversial proposal. It has generated a great deal of debate, information and knowledge and, in some cases, has tended to split communities. The debate has centred on a number of areas, from the issue of natural resources in general to the process by which planning permission was approved for the pipeline from the well head to the landfall and from the landfall to the terminal and the examination process that was undertaken in respect of the terminal itself. The debate has also focused on issues of design and safety with particular reference to the section of pipe from the landfall to the terminal. Environmental issues and planning and safety in respect of the terminal have also been discussed. There is also the question of where we go from here.I very much regret the manner in which this flagship project has been handled. The local authority, the Government and the Shell company were negligent in their duty. That forced local residents, because of their concerns about design and safety, to protest legitimately. Some of these people eventually found themselves in contempt of court and they served 94 days in prison. I am glad these men have been released back into their communities and families.I was pleased to an extent that the Government took on board advice about being prepared to fund an international audit of safety in respect of the pipeline, that the company agreed not to do any work until next year on that section of the line and that following advice given by both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party in terms of the distinction between criminal contempt and civil contempt, the temporary injunction was lifted last week and the five men were allowed to go home.The Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development, delivered by the then Department of Energy in 1992, contain a foreword by the Minister of the day, Robert Molloy. The fundamental point in respect of the Government's policy base decision is that "Since the Government do not consider that direct State involvement in this area of activity is appropriate, the pursuit of their policy objectives requires that competent private sector companies be encouraged to invest in the search for and production of oil and gas in Irish waters."A number of environmental issues need to be dealt with immediately and they have been referred to by the engineering staff of Shell. They need to be dealt with particularly in regard to work undertaken on the terminal site at Bellanaboy. The Minister should ask Dúchas, or whatever is the appropriate body, for a list of what is required to be dealt with immediately. This list should be furnished to him tomorrow. I am quite sure everybody concerned will be happy to allow the rectification works to be carried out forthwith. The Shell personnel carrying out the works should be supervised to ensure they are carried out strictly in accordance with all the proper environmental guidelines, as laid down and required by law.Let us consider what natural resources mean and could mean to the country. Bearing in mind that Ireland is in a very different position from Australia, New Zealand or Norway, it is appropriate that Bord Gáis, which I have not heard comment on this issue, should set out its views on the economic advantage to the Irish State, economy, people and industry of the supply from the Corrib field. What is the projected saving arising from our being able to use gas from the Corrib rather than importing it during the next 20 to 25 years, which is the projected lifetime of the field? What is the requirement for gas on a daily, monthly and annual basis, as projected by Bord Gáis? We should hear this because many say the gas affords no advantage at all to the State or its economy.I have been contacted by at least a dozen major Irish industries that would like to install combined heat and power processors to drive their own generating plants and sell the remaining power into the grid. Bearing in mind the cost bases arising, Ireland has become uncompetitive. We have slipped from fourth to 26th on the competitiveness scale. There are jobs at stake by the thousand in many areas.It is only appropriate that Bord Gáis should state what it proposes to do about the spur lines, six of which it mentioned when it made a presentation to Mayo County Council a couple of years ago. None of these spur lines has seen the light of day. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, who is absent, made commitments in his capacity as Minister at a public meeting in Belmullet to the effect that he would provide moneys from his Department to extend a spur line from Bellanaboy to Belmullet such that the people of Belmullet, the first town, should have the opportunity to avail of the benefits of gas. None of this has happened. We have had no response from the Government or Government agencies on the value of what is supposed to be done.The ESB has restrictions on production capacity but it is very obvious that in the north west, particularly County Mayo, there is a scarcity of capacity. Why is the Government not now pursuing Rolls-Royce Power Ventures and the other companies that showed an interest in the beginning in providing gas-fired electricity generating stations, one of which was to be sited at Bellacorick, where the peat power plant closed resulting in the loss of over 200 jobs? The serious statement by Rolls-Royce Power Ventures seems to have been put on the long finger. I do not hear any response from the Government about the possibility of providing a gas-fired plant.I am satisfied that the circumstances surrounding this debate can be focused and concentrated through the work of whatever mediator of sufficient stature is willing to take up this quite complex position. I hope the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has a measure of success in this regard. I was heartened by a number of interviews given by some of the men from Rossport. They indicated that they want to involve themselves in this debate. The fundamental question that must be asked and answered concerns whether the pipeline is safe. The Minister cannot sign the consent unless he is satisfied that the pipe to go underground is safe and will not compromise, in any way, any person's safety or health. No project, big or small, national or multinational, is worth the loss of one life.A number of other questions need to be asked. Is treated gas safer than untreated gas? Is untreated gas in a pipe designed to cater for a pressure of 345 bars as safe, less safe or safer than treated gas in Bord Gáis pipes such as those that have been in operation in the country for the past 30 years and those which are currently being laid at great speed from Loughrea through every village and parish on their way to the terminal at Bellanaboy? Will the discussion to take place at the two-day hearing and Advantica's dealing with the issues of safety and design take into account the consequences of a full-bore rupture?Will the Minister explain the minimum pressure required to bring the product from the reservoir to the terminal? The pipe is designed for a pressure of 345 bars, to operate, it is said, at a maximum of 150 bars, with a normal operating pressure of 120 bars. Can it operate at a pressure of 100 bars or 80 bars? Can it operate with untreated gas at the same pressure or at a lower pressure than that which now obtains in the Bord Gáis pipe? Is it possible to put reducers on the reservoir wellhead and give responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency or some such body to ensure that the pressure is kept at the minimum operating pressure until the reservoir starts to empty after a number of years? The Minister has responsibility for the pipe. What agency will determine that it is safe at all times, day and night?Although the Minister amended the Gas Act 1976, the pipeline from the landfall to the terminal should have been part of the transparent, accountable planning process in the first instance. This would have dealt with issues of design, safety and health and would not have resulted in ordinary people being put in fear of their lives because of legitimate fears over these issues. The aforementioned questions need to be asked and answered. Given that the Minister made an authorisation for the pipeline from landfall to terminal not to require a compulsory purchase order or planning permission, is it possible to vary the line of the pipe without its requiring, or its being seen to require, a new application for planning permission?There are polarised views. People from certain organisations want the platform built at sea on a shallow-water terminal and the gas processed at sea. Many say they have no objection whatsoever to treated gas coming ashore. Others have different points of view. As a representative from County Mayo, I note that the issue has always caused some difficulty in that we did not submit the application for the onshore terminal, nor did we specify its design and features. However, the Government has issued authorisation for a pipeline to be laid from the wellhead to the landfall and the planning and judicial process has led to the granting of permission for a terminal. In the section in between there are 29 land-holders, five of whom have lodged serious objections regarding health and safety.The mediator will be required to help focus on the next move. I defend the stance taken by my colleague, Deputy Ring, who was a strong advocate of the rights of the people of Rossport long before many others became involved. He has stood up for their rights and asked for the truth to be told. It was not Deputy Ring, the Fine Gael Party nor the Labour Party which applied for the terminal in the first place but we must deal with what we find.Two elements of the project have been approved by the Government. One was approved by the Minister's predecessor. The middle section is the source of the legitimate concerns about safety expressed by the local people. A two-day hearing, to be chaired by Mr. John Gallagher, will not be sufficient as it will not be possible to answer a range of questions in the short term. The Minister may be required to give considerably more time to allow for answers to be given to these questions.I am somewhat concerned that while the Shell Corporation in Ireland is comprised of two units, Irish Shell and Shell E&P, when Shell Corporation decided to sell its Irish entity to an equity group, the regulations governing the rights and benefits of 150 employees working in Dublin in the areas of finance, administration, sales and product development seemed to be changed. Some have been employed by Shell for a considerable period. As this will be a share option and a share sale rather than a transfer of undertaking, the rights and benefits of these employees seem to have suddenly changed. A full Labour Court hearing will deal with this matter which should be taken into account by the Minister.A major proposal such as this should have been dealt with differently by the Government. The entire community in the western region would have welcomed a major project if it had been handled with sensitivity, greater consideration and courtesy and greater awareness of the potential impact for good on the county, the region and the country as a whole. It has been a long road which has caused great stress and pressure for local families and communities have been divided. I hope that in this period of relative calm, under whomever is appointed as mediator, everybody concerned will enter into direct discussions about their legitimate fears for health and safety. When the safety audit is concluded, the Minister will be faced with the ultimate question. Taking into account his own words about the safety and concerns of local people, will he be sufficiently happy with the design and scale of the pipeline to sign the consent on behalf of the Government? If he is not satisfied, he cannot sign. I assume he will be required to make a statement on his intentions should that arise.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I wish to share my time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.When the people of Dublin applauded the five released Rossport citizens on Saturday last, they were rightly acknowledging the great determination, courage and perseverance of the men from north west Mayo. The thousands who marched behind them and the bystanders who stopped to cheer instinctively understood the Rossport residents did not lightly give up their freedom for 94 days and only as a last desperate resort in a very unequal struggle with giant international exploration companies were they prepared to defy a court injunction. On each of my visits to Micheál Ó Seighín, Mr. Vincent McGrath, Mr. Willie Corduff, Mr. Philip McGrath and Mr. Brendan Philbin at Cloverhill Prison they always concluded our conversations by strongly stressing that the Corrib impasse was simply due to a matter of the health and safety of their families and community. It was a message which I took to the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, Shell, Statoil and all the other interested parties. Their release from prison after three months and the hopeful developments which facilitated their release are a vindication of their brave and resolute stand.As day followed day during the imprisonment, like most observers, I was struck by the great support the men received from their wives and families. Outside the court, at public demonstrations and in Cloverhill Prison, the wives and children of the Rossport Five provided staunch and unyielding encouragement. The people of Rossport, Erris and County Mayo also gave their support. My key link during the sad events of the past three months was Mr. Harry Barrett and the Mayo branch of the Labour Party. Within days of the men's imprisonment, Mr. Barrett suggested that we make urgent contact with our sister Labour Party in Norway and Statoil. It must also be acknowledged that the Shell to Sea Campaign provided a stream of information and support for the five imprisoned men on its website and through the media. Much of the information provided for me and other Dáil colleagues on the history of the Corrib project and exploration in Irish waters comes by way of the diligence of the Shell to Sea group.It is clear that the Minister, his predecessors and the Taoiseach bear a heavy responsibility for the appalling mess which resulted in the imprisonment of the Rossport Five. Their gross neglect of Ireland's natural resources, characterised by the minimal number of staff in the petroleum affairs division of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, led to the situation where a huge multinational such as Shell felt able to act with impunity and coolly disregard planning conditions and ministerial consent in the building of a totally illegal stretch of pipeline. How could four civil servants monitor a €1 billion major infrastructural project? Is it any wonder that the Minister and his Department had hardly a clue as to the size of the Corrib field or the likelihood of future discoveries off our coast?At last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, a committee disgracefully filibustered and delayed in meeting during the men's imprisonment by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats majority, the Minister could only wring his hands and make nonsensical comments about spending €10 million or €20 million of public money on drilling oil and gas wells in the Atlantic. I will repeat what I said to him on that occasion. There is another way which has been well trodden by the Norwegians, the Danes, the people of the Shetlands, the Newfoundlanders and many other smaller states and regions. It was best articulated by the Norwegian Government in the late 1960s and early 1970s when it told Shell, BP, Texaco and other representatives of big oil companies to leave the Norwegian oil and gas fields alone until "we know what you know". When Norwegian engineers and scientists had learned what the oil industry knew, the Norwegian Government permitted exploration to proceed on terms which firstly benefited the Norwegian nation and its descendants.The Minister will reply that only two applicants were involved in the recent licensing round and that the strike rate for our exploration in the Atlantic is only one in 30 wells. The level of independent expertise available to the Government has always been derisory and the Department has functioned — to paraphrase IBEC's characterisation of CER — as the downtown office of Marathon and Shell.Last Saturday I described the imprisonment of the Rossport Five as a wake-up call for the people. The suffering of the men and their families will have an enduring legacy if the House closely examines and profoundly reforms the legislation and planning procedures governing the licensing and development of our national resources. The legislative and exploration planning framework failed the people of Rossport and County Mayo. Throughout the long saga of the Enterprise Oil and Shell planning application, there have been continuous complaints about the 1960 Act, the 1992 licensing terms and the 1976 Gas Act. In 1987 significant changes were introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, which many citizens believe should be the subject of a tribunal of inquiry. In 1992 the Taoiseach and the then Minister, Mr. Bobby Molloy, issued the current licensing terms.It is amazing that all aspects of the Corrib project were never discussed in detail in this House or Seanad Éireann in the ten years since the Corrib discovery. The long-standing and well based complaint from the Rossport Five and their supporters of the very small contribution of this €1 billion project to the economy and society of County Mayo and Connacht was never aired in this House until they began their imprisonment. We asked many questions over a period of months but the Minister's Department provided very little information. It is clear that the governing legislation is defective in the manner it cedes incredible powers to the Minister of the day in respect of exploration without the ongoing scrutiny of the Oireachtas. It is also defective in regard to health and safety issues, as clearly identified by the Rossport community, as well as the absence of a role for the Environmental Protection Agency in the invigilation of exploration projects. The Labour Party believes all of these matters must be addressed urgently and calls on the Minister to bring forward amending legislation. The five Rossport citizens have always stressed to me that the total lack of consultation by Shell on their concerns and their real fears for the health and safety of their families has been the key motivation for their long struggle against the Corrib project in its current form.Throughout the planning process in the 28th Dáil there were allegations, most notably by our colleague, Deputy Ring, that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources were interfering in the process and seeking to intimidate Mayo County Council. As I outlined last week, it is also amazing that within days of the start of the general election campaign for this Dáil on 15 April 2002 the Minister of State approved the plan of development for the Corrib field under the 1960 Act, approved the giving of consent to construct a pipeline under the 1976 Gas Act and the giving of consent to construct sub-sea structures under the Continental Shelf Act. Incredibly, the Department announced these authorisations and then added that the petroleum affairs division was still in discussions with Enterprise Energy Ireland on the conditions attaching to each authorisation. The Minister of State also gave approval, in principle, to developments under the Foreshore Act.The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has been quick to state how modifications of the licensing regime would deter potential exploration ventures, but this does not seem to be the case in other jurisdictions, most notably the United Kingdom where Chancellor Gordon Brown changed the British licensing regime in the 2002 budget and was met with denouncements much like the repeated comments of the Minister. However, subsequent licensing rounds in the United Kingdom resulted in an unprecedented number of applications.Early in the period that I represented the Labour Party in this portfolio several Dublin citizens were killed in a house gas explosion. I drew the attention of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the complete lack of gas infrastructure in Connacht when the committee last questioned Bord Gáis Éireann. Against this background, the information I received on the Rossport pipeline from physicists such as Professor Werner Blau and other scientists is disturbing. The maximum allowable operating pressure of 345 bar seems incredibly high for a structure passing within 70 metres of a family home. We were repeatedly told that the design code used by Shell engineers to achieve a particular pipe wall thickness was the British Standard 8010, which I am informed is now obsolete. The pressure of gas proposed to be transported through the pipeline only 70 metres from a home equates to 4.4. GW or 2.2 kt of TNT. Therefore, the deeply held fears of Rossport residents have a strong basis.The chief executive officer of Shell, Mr. Andy Pyle, told me that Shell and its partners had spent €6 million in the local economy since construction activity commenced and that the company was committed to making contributions to local community funds of €2 million. He also stressed that there would be 1,000 construction jobs, ancillary jobs and ultimately 50 permanent jobs at the refinery. However, people in north Mayo correctly point out that in the long term the addition to the economy and society of north Mayo and the rest of the county will be derisory. I call on the Minister to start today to greatly increase the gains for the local economy by utilising all our State agencies, Shell and Statoil to bring forward a plan of development which will ensure many of these resources come to north Mayo.It remains an outrage that the five Rossport citizens should have had to endure 94 days in Cloverhill Prison to vindicate their position and secure an agreed mediation and safety audit structure. I am proud to record that the essence of the formula which finally led to their release was first proposed and advocated strongly by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, in early July. I acknowledge a similar formula was put forward by the leader of Fine Gael and our colleagues in that party. At our meetings with the Minister, the chief executive of Shell, Mr. Andy Pyle, and his executives, Mr. Helge Helgestad and Mr. Peter Smith of Statoil, we constantly urged the lifting of the court injunction as the first crucial step in securing an agreed resolution of this affair. We were also the first Irish representatives to make contact with the Norwegian embassy and the outgoing Norwegian Prime Minister in July. The Taoiseach resolutely refused my request to recall Dáil Éireann on this matter while the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy O'Flynn, failed to call a meeting of the committee to help broker a solution. The fact that Norway was in the throes of a general election campaign also made it difficult to exert pressure on Statoil and Shell to change their approach and free the Rossport men. Now that they are free, I do not underestimate the difficulties which will have to be overcome in the coming weeks to move the Corrib project towards a fully agreed gas recovery development.It is essential that the released men, their families and supporters are fully involved in all aspects of shaping a process to fully review the pipeline project. From my research and observations, I cannot see how the current pipeline proposal can be sustained even as part of the Advantica review process. An offshore and undersea solution seems the only way forward. I salute the bravery and integrity of the Rossport Five, their families and supporters, and thank the Minister, Mr. Andy Pyle of Shell and Mr. Helge Hatlestad of Statoil for restoring their freedom and putting in place a framework to break the impasse and bring this vital national resource at Corrib into production.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I wish to respond to a commentary on the recent event of the release of the Rossport Five. A suggestion in yesterday's editorial in The Irish Times reads:. . . [the] President of the High Court, stood alone in recent weeks in upholding the rule of law, a duty he executed with exemplary even-handedness and for which he deserves to be thanked. During this controversy too many people, and most regrettably several members of the Oireachtas, showed a lack of understanding, or were simply unwilling to accept, the proper separation of powers that underpins the correct relationship between the legislature and judiciary.Many of us who have been here for a long time perfectly understand the separation of powers and the appropriate relationship that should apply between the Legislature and the Judiciary. It is a source of concern for both if decisions were taken in regard to resources policy that were improper, not within the terms of the Constitution or not legally in the best interest of the people. It is a matter for both to seek discovery as to why, in regard to resources policy, the 1975 regime was changed in favour of the 1987 regime which, in turn, was changed in 1992, when an Irish resource, the foreshore, which was in the ownership of the people, was given away.It is also in our interests that the Judiciary should comment on the inadequacy in regard to rights that arise in European law for citizens to protect themselves against an unknown, unspecified and unquantified danger. That might have been an appropriate reflection on the part of the Judiciary. In regard to not only matters of safety but also matters of planning, a good warning might have been given in respect of the impropriety of Ministers and Ministers of State asking their colleagues to come together to sign documents — as I was invited to do and refused — to short-circuit the statutorily independent planning process. There are many matters that could have been commented on in regard to the separation of powers, including the appropriate behaviour of the Judiciary and Parliament.As someone involved in law-making, I raise the appropriateness of issuing orders that do not have the full force of the law, for example, the giving of an injunction on a fragile basis to protect something that is illegal. Again, it is a matter for the Legislature and the Judiciary to examine the appropriate interpretation of Acts and orders under the Foreshore Act. I am sure the matter of the moving of the foreshore several kilometres inland will be of some consequence for historians. People will examine this issue and speculate. I am sure it is a matter in regard to which Madam in The Irish Times might decide to read some of the articles of the columnists who write in her newspaper and she might be better informed before she decides to give lectures on the separation of powers.This is an appalling ugly little editorial which suggests in some way that while justice stood on behalf of five people who had to spend over 90 days in prison to protect themselves and their families in the absence of appropriate legislation and support for the law, there are those who would prefer if everyone in the State was rolling over with their bellies up so as to say the people who do not give a damn about justice are those who matter because they are siding up and is not justice great? There are many questions to be asked about the legality of this. I hope the issue is suitably resolved but I reject the disgraceful nonsense of this editorial comment. We are all legislators and are aware of the complexity of this issue. We all know how murky its background is and we would all like to see the air cleared.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I wish to share time with Deputies Sargent and Ó Snodaigh.Before I entered the Dáil in 2002, I had spoken about the profligate giveaway of our national resources. It is a matter I have raised from time to time since I became a Deputy. In 2000 the oil companies told us that the Corrib gas project was worth £2 billion. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, informed us on national television last night that it is worth €2 billion. At least we know the difference between the punt and the euro, even if Deputy Parlon does not. If it is €2 billion, as he would have us believe, the value of the gas field has dropped by approximately 25%.In 2000 the going rate for a barrel of oil was $10. In 2005 it is six or seven times that, at $60 to $70 a barrel and Deputy Parlon informs us that Corrib gas has gone down in value by 25%. We know that the original value of £2 billion for Corrib gas was deliberately kept very low by the oil companies for the purpose of fooling us. After the Minister of State's performance on television last night, it is obvious that the Government and the oil companies still share the cosy consensus which is as strong as ever. Who do they believe they are fooling? Even if the original 2000 valuation of £2 billion was correct, we know that by applying today's values the Corrib gas field would be worth £12 billion. Adding the 25% currency conversion would put the value up to at least €16 billion.In  The Irish Times today, we saw the heroic Rossport five standing behind the illegal pipe, a testament to the arrogance of Shell which was asked by the Minister to dismantle it last July. It has still not been dismantled. It is unacceptable that these five honourable men went to jail for 94 harrowing days before the injunction brought by Shell and its partners was ended. However, they are still not free. Neither is Ms Bríd McGarry, the sixth Rossport resident, and the dangerous pipeline is still a reality. Applying any British, American or international standard — or even Shell’s own design standard — they are living within the kill zone of this pipeline, since 70 metres is certainly not safe.I visited Norway just under two weeks ago with the Rossport five's family members. We found the Norwegian people to be very straightforward and transparent. We met the top union people and we met the Norwegian oil and gas minister. We met the incoming government MPs and the senior vice-president of Statoil, Mr. Helge Hatlestad. They were absolutely amazed and astounded at what was happening in Ireland and did not have the full picture at all. They were determined to do something about the situation. This was a critical time to visit as negotiations were under way for a new government. The strong message from Statoil, which incidentally owns 25% of our Corrib gas field, is that such a scandalous state of affairs would not be tolerated in Norway. The State owns none of the field, despite the guarantees in the Constitution. The Norwegians believe in their democracy and assured us this could not happen in Norway, insisting that such a project could not go ahead without the consent of the people. Hot on our heels, Statoil's second top executive, Mr. Hatlestad, came to Ireland and did what he told us he would do.We have to be thankful, I suppose, that this is not Nigeria or the Rossport five would have been hanged long ago. I believe our visit to Norway tipped the balance in favour of the removal of this terrible injunction. The Government is up to its neck in all of this, thanks to a corrupt former Minister, Ray Burke, and the current Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance. We gave it all away even before we got it, although it is ours under the Constitution. At the same time, serious deficiencies exist in our health and social services due to funding difficulties. It is a scandal.Everyone knows that the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Fahey, did away with any need for planning permission for this unique pipeline. He is currently a Fianna Fáil Minister of State from Galway West. The decent people of Galway, his constituents, rallied with supporters of the Rossport five on their peaceful demonstrations. These farmers from Gort, Ballinasloe or wherever, understood what it must be like to be thrown off one's land and have it given away to a powerful interest. They were not strangers to that. It happened before in our history. The people of Gort and the people of Ireland understood all this and came out strongly in support of the Rossport five. That support has grown to 100%. They surely understand what Michael Davitt fought for and how their own Government facilitates the taking of that land under compulsory requisition orders by the State. The people who should be protecting them were doing them down on behalf of the oppressor, Shell, the oil multinational.If this injunction is made permanent this month, I assure the House that they, too, could end up in jail if the State wants their land — or if it wants the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's land or mine. They will resist it being taken and will end up in jail as a result. Nothing could be more certain. They could end up in jail just from thinking bad thoughts about Corrib gas. People in their thousands have supported the Rossport five. As I said at last Saturday's rally, the human spirit cannot be bought or sold. Neither can it be imprisoned, as the Government found out. These brave men refused to give in to Shell. They have done us proud and are still doing us proud. We need a full comprehensive review of the Corrib gas project, not a repeat of the inadequate Shell-influenced company reviews.to date, which are ridiculous.This is a narrow peninsula, a space which cannot accommodate a unique pipeline and a village full of houses. This problem must be resolved. It is a scandal and thank God these five brave men are free and are now with us.

Ní raibh suim ag a lán daoine. Ní raibh suim ag na meáin chumarsáide, den chuid is mó, sular cuireadh na fir seo i bpríosún. Ní nach ionadh, bhí ceisteanna a n-ardú ag mo chomhghleacaí, Deputy Eamon Ryan, anseo, agus agamsa agus ag daoine eile le blianta. Dob é an Comhaontas Glas an chéad pháirtí ag an am céanna a chuir an cheist in iúl do na húdaráis pleanála i gceannas ar an píblíne ó Chraughwell go Bellanaboy chomh maith.This situation, although the Minister incorrectly tries to make it otherwise, is not normal. He talks about the onshore option being increasingly common, as if this was comparable to what happens in other countries. I have been to Rossport and seen that the pipeline route will, in the case of one house, run across the driveway. As Deputy Cowley mentioned, 70 metres is most certainly within a kill zone. It is amazing how this situation has arisen. I am sure we are not going to obtain all the answers today. It is clear, however, that many questions need to be answered. Reference was made to 1992 when the deal was struck behind closed doors, without civil servants being present, between the Minister at the time, Ray Burke, and the exploration companies. An explanation as to how that was allowed to happen without civil servants being present definitely needs to be investigated. It is also important to get answers as to who approached whom. I do not believe that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was able to say whether Coillte or the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, approached Enterprise Oil, or whether the exploration company approached Coillte. Apparently there are no records in the Department on that matter. That is the core reason that the House is debating this matter.Why would a company want to venture nine kilometres into a bogland of its own accord? I believe many questions still need to be resolved before this matter is resolved. When the Minister talks about "both sides", I believe we also need to get clarity on that matter. This is not a so-called game of two halves or two points of view. This is where the Minister, the Department and the State have become players in a three-way debate between the company, the Government and the community. Any mediator must mediate between the three main players involved in this issue. I ask the Minister to recognise that he, on behalf of the Government, is one of these players. He is not a neutral bystander who can sit on the fence and expect the matter to be resolved by putting the local community and the company into the ring.In so far as we have access to the relevant documentation — discovery is still pending on a significant number of documents — this is another example of legal questions arising with regard to the veracity of documents. The "Dear Brian" letters written by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, are spoken of as if they are legal documents and, therefore, constitute consent. I have no doubt that a considerable amount of the documentation could be challenged on the basis that it is not based on best legal precedent and is not legally trustworthy or possible to uphold.The Corrib pipeline is unprecedented. Other onshore terminals are located either on islands or on the coast and certainly do not run nine kilometres across bogland, as is proposed in the case of Bellanaboy. The pipeline was exempted from an oral hearing in questionable circumstances and a compulsory acquisition order was issued by a private company. Giving a private company power to issue such orders has opened up a dangerous precedent for the future.The Government must recognise that it has got itself into a mess. A safety review and public hearing are under way and a legal process is ongoing before the courts. Whether either process will amount to a final decision is open to question. Alternatively, will the mediation process to which the Minister referred result in a final decision, even if is three-way? The Minister must provide clarity to allow us to see some light at the end of this very murky pipeline.

Ba bhua é don chúigear agus dá gclann as a gcrógacht agus an cur chuige a léirigh siad thar tréimhse 13 seachtain i ngéibheann.

B'fheachtas seo a tharraing daoine le chéile le dearcaidh pholaitiúla dhifriúla agus daoine gan dearcadh polaitiúil ar bith. Léirigh sé deighilt bhunúsach idir páirtithe polaitiúla agus fiú laistigh díobh. Bhí léiriú air sin ag cinnirí na dtrí mhórpháirtithe sa Teach seo faoin deighilt sin.Ba deighilt í idir iad siúd a sheas go hiomlán ar thaobh iad siúd a bhí ag léiriú míbhuntáistí eacnamaíochta agus timpeallachta a bhí in ndán dúinn de thairbhe phíobán na Coirbe agus ar an taobh eile iad siúd a bhí ag tabhairt tacaíochta agus tús áite go hiomlán do spéis agus buntáistí Royal Dutch Shell. Let us be clear about that.As the Corrib gas field development stands, neither the people of County Mayo nor the citizens of the State stand to gain in any real way from the gas if it is brought on shore. Muintir Iorrais will have a dangerous pipeline at their back doors, carrying gas to which they will not even have access. This gas will be piped in by a company whose annual turnover is bigger than the State's GDP and which has, to all intents and purposes, been given the gas field for nothing. Surely it is an outstanding act of generosity for a Government to allow the company in question to write off all its tax and charge the full price for selling the gas it extracts to Bord Gáis, which this week imposed a massive price increase on its customers, many of whom already face fuel bills they cannot afford.We know who we have to thank for this gift, namely, individuals such as Ray Burke who was no doubt motivated by the highest sentiments when he made the original deal. Sinn Féin has called for a full inquiry into why and how multinational companies were handed over control of our natural resources at terms unequalled anywhere else on the planet. I reiterate that demand and call for any review of the Corrib gas field debacle to include full disclosure of all aspects of the deal. What, for example, were the terms under which the former Minister of State at the Department of Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, signed over Bellanaboy Wood for the terminal site? Why were parts of the report written by Kevin Moore for An Bord Pleanála and detailing the lack of economic benefits ignored? Why was misleading information given regarding the potential disaster which might have occurred had the pipeline been in place at the time of the Dooncarton landslide? What did the Taoiseach discuss with the president of Shell when he met him? If these and many other questions are to be answered, any inquiry or judicial review needs to be carried out on the basis of full disclosure. All minutes from the Department relating to the project must be made available, as must the minutes of the Taoiseach's meeting with the Shell president. After years of hiding behind the alleged lack of ministerial responsibly for Coillte, all documents relating to the transfer of Bellanaboy Wood must be placed in the public realm.The Rossport men and their families and supporters have won a tremendous victory. As Owen Wiwa, the brother of murdered Ogoni activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, said on Saturday at a Dublin rally for the men, "Such victories are rare." It is, however, only a temporary victory and the real issues have yet to be resolved. Unless they are resolved, the pipeline moved offshore and the State changes the licensing and revenue conditions governing the project, the campaign against the development, as currently proposed, will continue.
#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	390	The discovery of natural gas off the County Mayo coast was broadly welcomed by most people in the county and elsewhere as a wonderful boost to meeting Ireland's energy needs for the next quarter of a century. When it was eventually announced that the gas would be brought ashore in Mayo a bright future was predicted for the county. The planning and construction of this major project has been fraught with difficulty in recent years, culminating in a number of people finding themselves in jail for 94 days. The recent release from jail of the Rossport five is welcome news for their families and the general Erris community. I hope it will pave the way for constructive and meaningful dialogue that will result in a speedy resolution to the safety problems with the gas pipeline.It is unfortunate that the men in question found themselves in jail for taking action in response to fundamental fears about the safety of the project. All disputes are eventually resolved by dialogue in a calm and meaningful way, with each side listening to the point of view of the other, and this dispute is no different.I compliment the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on his proactive role in attempting to break the impasse in this dispute by having the men released from jail. Once the dispute became a subject of the courts, it became ever more difficult for the Government to intervene. Since the imprisonment of the five men, the Minister has endeavoured at every opportunity to create the conditions which would allow the dispute to be resolved. A full safety review of the Corrib onshore pipeline has been initiated, while the monitoring and supervision of the project has also increased. In addition, Advantica Consultants will conduct a full safety review and a public consultation process, including a two-day local oral hearing scheduled to take place later this month. People who have views on the safety of the pipeline will have the opportunity to have their opinions considered by the consultants and local residents and communities and interested parties have been invited to express their views on the issue. These are all positive steps taken by the Government and the Minister to further an open and transparent solution to the ongoing problem. The matter was also discussed recently at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, during which all participants in the debate sought movement on the issue.In recent times, it has become clear that certain political parties were exploiting the Rossport five to further their own political agendas. Intimidation was the order of the day, as people with genuine concerns about the plight of the men who tried to mediate in some way were subjected to harassment. The involvement of those people or their accomplices in upcoming discussions will do nothing to promote a satisfactory resolution to this problem that has plagued the community of north Mayo over the past three months.I warmly welcome the fact that in the past week both sides have taken steps forward and that the five men have returned to their families. I welcome the fact, mentioned earlier by the Minister, that representatives from both sides have gone into the site today. This move, along with the appointment of a mediator by the Government, will allow all those concerned to participate fully in the public consultation process of the safety review and I hope that both parties will create the conditions which will allow such a process to commence immediately. I urge those involved, working together in an open manner, to reach a solution that is acceptable to all.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. First and foremost, I welcome the release of the five men from Rossport who spent 94 days in jail. It was a terrible tragedy that their families and communities were deprived of their company for that period. We in this House must ensure that is never repeated.Throughout the course of the 94 days, Shell stated that it was impossible legally for it to lift the injunction and yet eventually that is exactly what it did. I suppose the question arising is why it took so long.While I welcome the Minister's announcement to introduce a mediator, and also the fact that he received a positive response from both sides, it was not exactly a new suggestion because when we debated this matter in the House at the end of June he suggested that he would be prepared to appoint a mediator. It is a shame that, unfortunately, 94 days passed before we could get some agreement on that particular matter and before the men could be released from jail.I welcome the Minister's announcement regarding the safety review on the pipeline, which is obviously central to this matter, and the decision on mediation. There are many questions about this project which must be answered. The issues fall into three categories. First, there is the local issue of the safety of the pipeline, which is of concern to the immediate community of Rossport, to the people of north Mayo and, indeed, to the wider community of Mayo, and which was central in terms of the jailing of the five men. The issue of gas supply to the region, which is a regional issue, is the second matter which really needs to be examined. The third issue, which is of national import, is the return to the Exchequer which has been mentioned here by all of my colleagues today. Each of these issues must be dealt with individually.Starting with the local issue of the safety of the pipeline first, last week at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources I put a number of questions to the Minister about the pipeline and the purchase of the site from Coillte for this terminal. I note in his response today he stated that he can only deal with the proposal that was put to him by the developer but, in fact, he was obliged to consider the suitability of that site because it was nine kilometres inland and, as he correctly stated earlier and at the committee last week, he has the ministerial power to examine the ongoing safety of the pipeline. Central to that was the location for the terminal building. Any lay person would imagine that such a facility would be close to the shoreline, would be a shallow water platform or might be on an offshore island. This was one of the points put forward by the Shell to Sea campaign in one of its comments in the national newspapers. It is a question that has not been addressed properly, whether or not alternative sites were considered because of the safety aspect of bringing a pipeline nine kilometres inland. It is a question that must be dealt with under the Advantica assessment, which will take place in the near future.At last week's committee meeting I asked the Minister a question and I thought he might have addressed it today. On the sale of the site, he mentioned that Coillte has a responsibility to bring any decision to sell a site before its board and that a proper evaluation of the site would be carried out. However, at the committee I asked the Minister whether Coillte had breached its own guidelines in the sale of that site by not going to public tender. While we in this House all know that guidelines are not necessarily legally binding, they do set out what is the most desirable procedure for the sale of the site in the first instance and this matter must still be addressed at this stage.Many local safety issues, particularly the proximity of the pipeline to the houses of the individuals concerned, arose at the committee meeting. We all noted from the Minister's reply at the committee last week that the Johnston report states that the minimum distance from any house would be 70 metres. I asked him from where that standard came, a question which remains unanswered. It does not comply with BS 8010 or the new equivalent, PD 8010. From where did that standard come? I welcome the fact that the Minister stated clearly this evening that this issue will be dealt with seriously under the safety review. It does not seem to fall under any particular standard and most people would be anxious to know from where that particular standard came in the first instance.The second matter I mentioned is the regional issue, the question of what exactly are the benefits to the people of Mayo. This is an important question for them. Deputy Carty and the other Members present stated that, at the outset, everyone from County Mayo welcomed the development of the Corrib gas field. We welcomed it for one reason only, which was that we perceived that there would be benefits to the people of our county arising from this find off our shoreline. We did not welcome it because County Mayo would be used as some vehicle to transport the gas off our shoreline, through our county, to the benefit of other people, either in Ireland or in other countries, wherever this gas will ultimately be used. I suppose in one sense it was perhaps selfish but we in County Mayo believe we have a right to derive some benefit from a find arising off our shoreline. At the committee I asked the Minister what will be the benefit for us. I did so with serious intent because it has been asked, I can assure him, by all of the people of County Mayo. I was disappointed with the glibness of the Minister's response. I say this, with respect, because I want him to realise that this is important. I asked him would he direct Bord Gáis, or provide a PSO, so that spur lines might come off the infrastructure, which is currently being laid the length and breadth of the county. While there is the situation in Rossport, literally every village in County Mayo has a pipeline going through it that is being laid by Bord Gáis. Is the Government prepared to issue a PSO to ensure that the people of County Mayo derive benefit through gas connections for our major towns? That is a serious question. When I asked about the matter at the committee, the Minister stated that whatever the chance we have if the Corrib field is developed, we have no chance whatsoever if it is not. That does not address the question or give it the seriousness I believe it deserves. It is an important issue. It was much touted at the outset of this project that there would be a benefit to the people of Mayo. Last week at the committee the Minister articulated the benefits in terms of jobs and perceived industrial development that might follow but that will only happen if the towns in County Mayo are connected to this supply.The third issue, which has been articulated by most Members, is the national issue. The latter is the benefit that the State derives from our natural resources, particularly from the licensing of this gas field. While the Minister explained the three various options in this article of 8 September 2005 in The Irish Times, at the committee last week and here again today, the reality is that the people of Ireland find it difficult to understand why we are not getting any benefit from this natural resource which is off our shoreline. He mentioned that we cannot invest €20 million to develop a single well. He mentioned at the committee that there were 121 wells drilled off our shores but only four commercial developments of those have been successful. The Corrib field, in itself, consists of five wells, all of which are commercially viable. He mentioned earlier — he also stated this in his article in The Irish Times— that if conditions in the country improve, he will not hesitate to renegotiate the terms for the benefit of the Irish people. However, I am alarmed to hear him state that this would be where a situation similar to the North Sea, where there are 7,000 productive wells, might arise. Surely he is not suggesting that there must be several thousand productive wells off our shores before the State can renegotiate a more beneficial deal for the people of Ireland. It is clear to everybody that we will have to purchase the gas at the going commercial rate and I am sure the 25% increase in the price of gas in the past week has not gone unnoticed.All of these matters contribute to the fact that the people of Ireland, and particularly those in Mayo, want to know what benefit is in this project for us. We are not anti-development in any way. In fact, we are pro-development. We are pro-development provided that the safety of our people is guaranteed and also provided that there is something beneficial in it to the county and the country at the end of the day.I urge the Minister to take these issues on board. Every citizen in County Mayo and throughout the country has asked for this during the past 94 days. If there is one thing the jailing of these men has achieved, it is that it has crystallised many of the issues for the people. It is no harm that they have been brought into the public domain. The people are much more knowledgeable today than they were three months ago with regard to concerns about our natural resources. I ask the Minister to address these concerns.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I wish to share time with Deputy Ring. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this matter. We should all be glad, even at this late stage, that we have arrived at a situation where the men who were in prison are free. If one were to evaluate the history of this situation from last June to today, it would be a great lesson in how business should not be done. Matters were allowed to drag on day after day throughout the summer months and nothing appeared to happen.I compliment those who were involved and who made constructive suggestions throughout this time with a view to achieving a resolution because it is not always popular to be constructive in such situations. We could have reached the current position in the first three or four days as easily as it has been reached after three months. It is disgraceful that, in a democracy, people must spend three months in prison before the wheels are set in motion to lead, eventually, to their release.If the planning or consent processes were wrong, why was it not possible to review them earlier? Why was it necessary to leave the men in prison for the duration? Throughout that period Deputies Kenny and Ring made numerous suggestions as to how to resolve the situation. Deputies Broughan and Rabbitte did likewise, as did many others. They spent much of their time in the summer attempting to intervene in a constructive manner that would enable the situation to be defused.At last Tuesday's meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it was obvious from the start that we were going nowhere because all we were doing was arguing the rights and wrongs of the case all over again. There was nothing by way of mediation, resolution or achieving what I hope was the objective.The House debated this issue in the last days of June in respect of a Private Notice Question to which everybody contributed. The Minister, knowing what he knew, being the ultimate arbiter in terms of consent and knowing that he alone had the ability to appoint a mediator of sufficient stature to be acceptable to both sides, should have taken the initiative at that time. The critical issue is the appointment of such a mediator who will be recognised and accepted by both sides. I hope the Minister accepts this suggestion, which has come from this side of the House. If this is done, the problem will be resolved. If it is not done, we will be here in three or four months having the same debate and possibly repeating the history of the disaster of the past three months. That should not, under any circumstances, be allowed to happen.We, Shell and everybody else are bound by the laws of the land. We must all comply with planning permissions and consents and must do what is required by the laws of the land. If we deviate from this or if the Minister allows anybody to deviate from it, we have a serious problem because it brings our laws into disrepute. If we bring laws and regulations into disrepute, particularly those relating to planning permissions and associated issues, we will have a serious problem. In these circumstances, I depend on the Minister to ensure that he uses his influence. He is the only one in a position to give the necessary assurances to both sides. He is in the driving seat and can tell the mediator what he can offer in response for whatever. Nobody else can do that.I do not want to pile coals on the Minister's head. However, he should remember that this issue has been sitting around for the past three months. Some people would say it has been present for three or four years. The pertinent issue of the men being in jail has been around for the past three months. When such individuals are in jail, people say they are doing a great job and that the country is behind them. This is thin consolation for those who are in prison and nobody should try to tell me any different because I have been there and done that.Instead of going back over what has happened, we should try to avoid a recurrence and address the issues that caused it rather than broadening the debate to include many extraneous matters. The issue to be resolved relates, in the first instance, to health, safety and planning. This matter falls to the Minister in terms of his ability to grant or withdraw consent. This fundamental issue affects the system in so far as the Corrib gas field is concerned. Resolution of the issue will not be an easy job. The situation would not have continued so long if it was.It is important the Minister concentrates on the job and that he ensures, whatever else happens, that the ultimate in terms of health and safety requirements are met. Failure to do this could lead to a serious situation arising for the people in the area and for people in other areas for whom a precedent may have been set. Deputy Ring will have more to say on this issue as he is a local representative.I believe the unresolved planning, consent and legal issues can be amicably resolved if there is a general application to the issue and if the Minister uses his positive influence on all concerned, through the mediator, to achieve the result desired by all.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I am glad the men are out of prison and pleased they are at home with their wives and families. Many of the other residents of the area who were not in prison have been badly affected by this situation over the past number of years. Many families in the Rossport-Bellanaboy area have suffered and wished they never heard the word "gas". They have been frustrated by Shell, Enterprise Energy Ireland, Mayo County Council, the former Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Fahey, and the Government.I want to go back to 2001 when the planning application came before Mayo County Council. I was one of the few members who spoke against it at the council. I will always remember the night when Enterprise Energy Ireland came into the council meeting and told us the wonderful things it would do for Ireland, County Mayo, Rossport, Bellanaboy and the people in Erris. A few weeks later, when it got the Queen's shilling from Shell, it was not long in selling the gas field to that company and forgetting the promises it made to the people of County Mayo.Mayo County Council must shoulder much of the blame on this issue. In 2001 the planning application was granted by the council in very quick time. I recall that an official rang me to inform me of it at 5.05 p.m. on the Friday of the August bank holiday weekend. The permission was granted in this manner to frustrate the residents and the people objecting to it so that they would not have sufficient time to put their objections to An Bord Pleanála.At the oral hearing, Mr. Kevin Moran, the inspector on behalf of the State, represented An Bord Pleanála. He listened to the concerns of the residents, the experts and everybody who was there and made the decision that the project was not fit for Erris. He opposed the second application that was made because, according to him, a project of this nature had never been pursued anywhere else in the world. He was overruled by the board on that occasion. He was the man who sat down to listen to various people and to study the matter. Although he travelled around the world to examine projects of this nature, he was overruled by the board.Mayo County Council did not behave well in this instance because it did not listen to the people. If the county manager and the council's officials told Enterprise Energy and Shell when this project was first mooted that they would have to develop the facility at sea, we would not have encountered the problems with which we are familiar and the five men in question would not have been obliged to spend 94 days in jail. Many families in Rossport and Bellanaboy have suffered and many people have been disturbed by the gas project.I would like the experts in The Irish Times, particularly the people who write editorials, to remember that Rossport, like most places in Erris, is a quiet, beautiful and nice place. Those who proposed to develop one of the biggest projects in the history of the State in a place that does not have much infrastructure thought they could bully the local residents, for example by taking their land. They thought they could do what they liked because they did not think the people of Bellanaboy would stand up and be counted.As a Member of the Oireachtas, I know I cannot overstep the line in respect of the courts. However, legislation needs to be introduced to ensure that Irish citizens who have serious objections, like the people of Bellanaboy, do not have to mortgage their houses when they go to the courts. I refer to people who have recourse to the legal system because they have been failed by their local authorities and their elected representatives. Ordinary people should be able to go to the courts without being worried that their lands, homes and farms will be robbed from them. The courts system should not just be for the rich — it should be for all the people of this country.I admit to the residents of Rossport and Bellanaboy that their elected public representatives did not do enough. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, spent weeks travelling up and down to County Mayo. There is a file in Mayo County Council which proves that his officials wrote to the county manager asking him to notify them when the application had been dealt with. The Minister of State wanted to be the first to be notified of whether the application had been granted. The county manager scribbled a note to tell his officials to notify the Minister of State. That is not the way the planning process works in this country. The man in question went above and beyond the call of duty in respect of this project.The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, challenged the Opposition Deputies today to a debate on natural resources. As part of that public debate, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, should sit on the Government benches to answer many unanswered questions about his role in this project. His officials should also be allowed to speak about the manner in which they were bullied. I do not blame them for anything that was done within the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources — they were just doing what they were ordered to do by the Minister of State. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, knows all about how the system operates.I hope we have learned a lesson from what happened in County Mayo. Members often speak about dialogue. There will be a mediator in this case. I was glad that the Minister used his influence with Shell. We called for such a move on the last Dáil sitting day before the summer recess. I agree with Deputy Broughan that it was a disgrace that the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources did not see fit to meet for three months until the day before the Dáil returned. It was a disgrace that there were not enough people to sign a quorum to call a meeting of the committee, so that the Minister would have to address its members. It is amazing that the Minister, Shell and the five men in question became involved in discussions two or three days after the Dáil returned. I do not understand why the five men had to stay in jail for 94 days. There was no need for them to spend a single day in jail. The Minister could have intervened or Shell could have collapsed the injunction. It was wrong that the men had to go to jail. They felt compelled to serve a prison sentence because they felt let down by the system, particularly by the council. It was wrong that all the resources of the State were used to support Shell.I hope the mediator who is appointed will ensure that the people of Erris are listened to on this occasion. This is not about money or land — it is about health and safety. It is about ensuring that people can live in their own homes in safety. They do not want to be blown up or to receive advice from people who think the pipeline is safe. Of course it will be safe until the day it explodes. When that day comes, nobody will take responsibility for the tragedy that will follow. People will run for cover by blaming everybody else and nobody will take responsibility. I want the gas to come onshore but there is only one way that can happen. The Minister needs to talk to Shell. If he had done so two years ago, we would not have the problems we have now. If people had listened to what I said during a county council meeting in 2001, we would not have the problems we have now. The gas would be coming in now if Shell had dealt with it at sea as it did throughout the world.I do not know why the Minister continues to insist that this country has not given away its natural resources. Of course we have given our resources away to multinational companies. The State will get nothing for its resources because, by the time the companies in question have used their tax breaks, the State will get nothing. Not only has the Minister given our resources away but his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, gave away the same licences last year, thereby giving the companies a full year in which to apply.The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has spoken about having to spend €30 million or €40 million on exploration to ascertain the levels of oil and gas which are to be found off our shores. He was a member of a Government that spent €60 million on electronic voting machines that nobody wants. Earlier today, the House debated the cost to the taxpayers of a payroll system that was supposed to be the most efficient system in the country. We would be far better off if we had spent €30 million or €40 million on finding out whether we have gas and oil. We should not have given exploration rights to multinational companies, which can tell the Government whether resources are available and can decide when to process them. The people of this country, who own such resources, will never know what is found off our shores.The greatest scandal of all is that County Mayo, which will have to deal with the many headaches involved in this project, will not benefit from it because no spur lines will be developed to any of its towns. The project would have received more support in County Mayo if the people of the county were benefiting from the development of additional infrastructure, the provision of gas and the creation of jobs. The people of Mayo do not support it because it is doing nothing for the county or the country as a whole. The price of gas increased by over 30% last Saturday, 1 October 2005. We should not feel sorry for Shell because its investment has trebled since the day it became involved in this project. The people of County Mayo have been let down by the Government and by Mayo County Council. I hope the members of the Government have learned their lesson and will listen to the people who will be affected by this project. They should not listen to experts who are well paid to give whatever type of advice is sought by those who employ them. If they are paid by people who are for something, they will find in favour of it. If they are paid by people who are against something, they will find against it.

I would like to respond to some of the serious issues which were raised.Deputy Kenny asked whether the environmental issues will be dealt with under supervised access. I mentioned earlier that the matter has been taken in hand today. Local people who have asked for supervised access have been allowed to visit the site to observe what is taking place. The Deputy also asked about the economic benefits of the project, which I have outlined on previous occasions. The major benefit of the project is that it will give this country an indigenous gas supply. It will lead to a reduction of approximately 50% in this country's imports of gas.

If we have an indigenous gas supply, there will be fewer constraints and a greater security of supply. We will not have to pay the additional transport costs which we would have to pay in respect of gas coming from outside the country. The Deputy also asked whether untreated gas is safer than treated gas. I think the answer, technically speaking, is that raw gas can cause problems but it depends on specific pressure and many other conditions. Treated gas is more manageable in transmission than untreated gas. This gas is treated at the wellhead before being brought onshore and is treated again at the terminal.The safety issues raised in a letter from Deputy Kenny to me have been passed on to Advantica and will form part of the safety review. The Deputy asked if pressure reduction devices were possible for the gas pipeline. They are possible and are used in this pipeline. The pressure at the well head is over 345 bar but gas will only pass through the pipeline at an average of 120 bar, although it can increase to 135 bar. The pipeline is built for a pressure of 150 bar.

It will generally operate at 135 bar pressure. However, after three or four years, a plateau will be reached and the pressure will begin to drop. Eventually, a suction process will be used to get gas out of the well.The Deputy asked about the variation of the pipeline route. If this is required, it will depend on a number of factors, but it could possibly require a new permission and consent procedure.Deputies asked about the value of the gas field. At current estimates, it is valued at some €3.7 billion, although I am not sure if that figure takes account of the latest increase in gas prices. The field contains approximately 900 billion cu. ft. of gas.While I do not want to constrain the chairperson with regard to how he handles this process, the idea of the two-day hearing is for local people to raise issues and concerns and bring forward any evidence they have to support their fears. Local people do not have to convince the media, me or anybody else. Advantica which is independent will make the decision on this matter. The local people — it is up to them — should make their case and state their fears. I received a letter from Deputy Kenny and one from Micheál Ó Seighin which will form part of the process. If interested persons want to submit a written submission rather than an oral submission, they can do so up to 13 October, or they can bring it to the hearing.I am glad Deputy Broughan has clarified Labour Party policy, namely, that it is the same as the Shell to Sea Campaign and that the only solution is offshore, which is also the Sinn Féin position. It is interesting to hear all of the hypocrisy spouted by the Labour Party on this issue. It was in government between 1992 and 1997 and had a Minister of State in the equivalent of my Department.

Deputy Broughan should not lecture me.During the debate I heard the repetition of the argument from Deputy Sargent and probably Deputy Broughan that Mr. Ray Burke changed the terms and conditions in 1987 at a secret meeting without civil servants being present. The civil servants who dealt with these matters at the time have categorically stated to me that this is untrue. They have stated to me on a number of occasions that there is no evidence whatsoever that anything like that happened. If a Member of the House has that kind of evidence, he or she has a duty to bring it forward. I will have it properly investigated.It is not the case, as Deputy Cowley stated, that the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, did away with any planning permissions or consents in regard to gas and oil exploration, pipelines or anything else. A specific regime is in place. It may not be perfect and we have probably learned a little in this regard. However, it is not the case that these were done away with by the former Minister.Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised questions about the sale of land by Coillte. That is a matter proper to the Department of Agriculture and Food. I understand parliamentary questions have been tabled for tomorrow and Thursday on the matter which it will be dealt with at that time.The legality of the various consents was raised by a number of Deputies. Much of this will be contested in court. However, some of the consents were tested in the High Court in July 2002 and withstood that test. On the question of withdrawing consents, my legal advice is that I cannot withdraw or withhold consents unreasonably. Shell obtained the consents and provided it operates within them, I cannot withdraw them.Reference was made to the possibility of ruptures and explosions — the term "kill zone" was used. The safety review will establish whether the distances between the pipeline and houses are in accordance with relevant standards, design recommendations and best international practice. Questions were raised as to whether 70 metres was a safe distance. I do not want to comment on this issue until the safety review is complete. However, from the files I have studied, 70 metres would seem to be the received wisdom of the company and various consultants who have previously examined the project.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Since it came into office, this Government has spent a grand total of €301 billion. Can the Taoiseach, Tánaiste or any Minister claim with confidence that the people have got anything remotely like the equivalent value for this amount that has been raised from their taxes or borrowed against future tax returns? The Irish have a reputation the world over as a can-do people. Sadly, we are addled with a cannot do, will not do Government. The evidence is on every page of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for this year, last year and every other year. This year's report is no aberration. Set against last year's report, it simply confirms that this Government has no sense of value and no commitment to change.The Government can only offer a catalogue of excuses for this list of jobs not done, half done and badly done. There are 14 chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which deal with waste and mismanagement. Together they constitute a bill of indictment for systematic failure and unshakable incompetence. The list of failures could fall into the category of funny if they were not so expensive. They range from an underpayment of €2 million due from National Toll Roads for the M50 toll and, amazingly, never even spotted, to widespread tax evasion in the construction industry which makes the notorious Ansbacher schemes seem like very small beer. In between, there is the truly extraordinary, not to say breathtaking, tale of the money spent by the national treatment purchase fund on operations in the original hospital of referral although the same hospital could not apparently treat those patients as they were entitled to be treated in the first place.Traditionally, Fianna Fáil has tried to claim a reputation for competence as its unique badge of pride. However, these annual catalogues of failure from the Comptroller and Auditor General prove that this reputation is now in shreds only to be regained when cleansed by a long, sustained spell in Opposition.Were Ministers alone in overseeing this extraordinary bonanza of State spending? The answer is "no". To help them spend the money, they hired for each Department a small army of spin doctors, consultants, advisers and make up assistants and they still got it hopelessly wrong.The enterprise strategy group in its recent report highlighted the need for Ireland to have "an effective and agile government" as has been said by its chair, Mr. Eoin O'Driscoll, on a number of occasions. One should note the word "agile". The report stated that: "The Irish public system proved itself capable of such responsiveness in the past, but many believe that Ireland has lost its former ability to respond quickly and flexibly to identified needs and that there is no longer a clear focus on enterprise as a key economic driver". Of course, the key economic driver requires necessary and competent infrastructure delivered properly and on time.It is clear the Government system for managing public finances has comprehensively broken down. Much of the failure has been disguised by the fact that tax revenues have been so buoyant. However, despite the low tax mantra of this Government, we have some of the highest indirect tax rates in the European Union, for example, our higher rate of VAT. If this Government was competent and careful with it's spending, could we have knocked a percentage or two off that very high top VAT rate? Every citizen who buys goods or services and pays these exorbitant VAT rates is actually paying the price for these cost overruns and delays every time he or she goes to a shop or pays for gas, electricity or any other service which incurs VAT. These are not abstract failures lost in the detail of public accounts. They affect everyone. It is interesting that the Exchequer returns published a couple of hours ago show VAT surging ahead.There are two areas of the report I particularly want to highlight. The first is the issue of taxation. The pursuit of tax evaders, whether Ansbacher account holders or others, has so far yielded an incredible €2 billion. The amount of money reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General to have been raised by the Revenue Commissioners through its programme of special investigations is truly breathtaking. However, despite these successes, figures in the report and confirmed by the latest list of tax settlements indicate that tax evasion continues to be a major problem and that there are those who are still prepared to take the risk of getting away with it. PAYE taxpayers, who have no choice but to pay on the nail every week, will also be disappointed to hear that almost €2.5 billion is outstanding in uncollected taxes, of which €692 million relates to the period between 1991 and 2002.For me the most disturbing part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is the section in chapter 2.8 dealing with relevant contracts tax, RCT, and the tax system for the construction industry, forestry and meat processing. The Comptroller and Auditor General examined a series of sample cases in Fingal, Cavan-Monaghan and the construction business unit of the large cases division of Revenue. The findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General suggest the potential amount of tax fraud and loss of revenue in this area is highly significant and I understand from people who know the business and the construction industry well that losses in relation to these construction industry scams may be running as high as €200 million to €400 million per year in recent years.The Comptroller and Auditor General found that 50% of the annual returns examined were late; no penalties were imposed for late returns; 12% of the samples included entries for many subcontractors without a payment card number and no RCT being deducted; and 7% had no tax reference numbers. In 1998, there was a special programme of site visits to contractors and as a result of that limited work 20% of subcontractors were properly reclassified as employees. As a result of these discoveries, the Revenue was supposed to carry out more checks. In fact, a special programme was supposed to commence in 2002 to highlight this type of fraud but it is not clear if it has ever been completed, although the loss of tax and, more importantly, PRSI may be hugely significant.Against a background of continuing evasion, it is worrying that the number of planned audits undertaken by Revenue has remained virtually static over 2003 while no random audits were undertaken in 2004. In 2004 the Revenue Commissioners carried out just 16,000 audits. Only some 1,500 of these were in respect of building contractors. This is striking when one considers how much the construction industry constitutes national economic activity. The compliance rate for the monthly returns from January 2005 is only 52%, far below the compliance rates for PAYE and PRSI. Up to 12 cases of RCT fraud have been investigated by the Revenue Commissioners in recent years. Two cases involved collusion among large numbers of individuals and companies, 97 in one case and 24 in the other, including principal contractors. While these cases were referred to the Garda, to date only one has resulted in a court conviction with the defendant sentenced to 240 hours of community service. The main weakness identified in these frauds was the fraudulent issue by principals of deduction certificates in respect of work never carried out and payments that were never made.The serious compliance problems that RCT was introduced to tackle still exist. They are compounded by the highly competitive nature of the industry where non-payment of tax debts is seen by some as a way to gain competitive advantage. Honest builders and contractors are being undercut by the continuing of major scams in the construction industry. Is the failure to resource the Revenue Commissioners to carry out adequate audits and oversight of the building industry essentially a political decision to go softly-softly on building industry scams? We know how long it took to get inquiries into Ansbacher, DIRT and other tax frauds under way. We also know the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, claimed there was no pot of gold in uncollected taxes. It would be a scandal if Fianna Fáil's cosy relationship with the building industry were to continue to facilitate tax fraud at the cost of higher taxes for workers in the PAYE sector and high rates of VAT for consumers.Chapter 15.1 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report contains a strong signal of fundamental problems of fraud in the personal public service numbers, the PRSI and tax reference number for every person in the State. It appears there is a significant fraud in the falsification of numbers. The report indicates levels of fraud running as high as 10% in certain categories. Even more worryingly, the report showed fraudulently obtained PPS numbers cannot be deleted, flagged or rendered unusable. The system name check facility to establish whether a PPS number had not already been allocated to a client was not applied to non-nationals because the system did not recognise foreign names. The use of bogus PPS numbers is giving their holders entitlements to welfare benefits with estimated losses at €25 million to €50 million per annum. This is a serious threat to the integrity of our social welfare system which will lead to high cost levels in the future. Added to the climate of fraud in a significant sector of the construction industry, the two together require immediate action by the responsible Ministers.The words "shock and awe" gained widespread currency from events in Iraq. They can also be used in this case but in a different context. Shock to describe the amounts of money lost by sheer waste with no value at all to the taxpayer and at the amounts spent with little or no meaningful return or value. Awe, to describe the dearth of results and the failure of so many projects. Members will recall the Taoiseach's spending of €36 million on Media Lab Europe, now gone with the wind. Awe at the indifference of those elected to manage the funds entrusted to them. Awe too at the refusal of the Taoiseach, as the one with ultimate responsibility, to sack the most flagrant offenders.This year's Comptroller and Auditor General report has 150 pages devoted to horror stories, large and small, on waste and mismanagement. Last year it was e-voting and the Punchestown Event Centre. Waiting in the wings for next year is the story of the €60 million spent on the National Aquatic Centre, the failed computer system in the health service and the fiasco of nursing home charges. It is time for the Taoiseach to take a long break.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19196	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	423	In the past eight years the Government has increased spending by an incredible amount, some 142%. This represents an increase of €17,000 in spending for every household in the State. The crux of the issue is do people see the value for that extra increase? The blunt answer is no. It is not just political opponents who claim this. Real indicators such as access to primary health care show this to be the case. A person on the minimum wage is now deemed to be too wealthy to be given a medical card. Fewer people attend accident and emergency departments, but those who do face greater chaos in the service. More people are on waiting lists for affordable housing, as those on low incomes simply cannot get on the housing ladder. Garda detection rates and drug seizures are down. Rates for violent assault and crime on the streets are up dramatically. The proportion of students dropping out of school is at the same persistently high level it has been for years. The standards of care for the elderly have not improved. No services are improving to match the huge scale of spending people are asked to come up with.By contrast, the public sees a chronicle of overruns, waste, ministerial pet projects going sour and poor efforts to protect the taxpayer when deals are struck. We need to get to the bottom of this. A system that protects the taxpayer must be developed. There is no doubt that waste has surged because in the good years, those two years up to the last election, spending controls went out of control under the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy. The systems to protect the taxpayer became rusted. Basic principles were abandoned.One can see patterns in how this happened. Budget day glamour announcements were one of the main factors with items such as the over-70s medical cards, the pre-1953 pension provision and, most notably, the decentralisation programme. The latter was to cost €20 million but tomorrow we will hear more a figure of €900 million. It is a deception to present projects that have not been properly costed, analysed or evaluated.Political pet projects, driven by ministerial ambition have been another problem. We have seen the Media Lab case of €36 million spent with nothing to show for it. We have seen the Campus and Stadium Ireland project with much work done but nothing to show for it. We have seen the Punchestown Event Centre, a pet project of the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, barged through every procedure that any responsible Minister for Finance ought to respect and protect. We have seen bad deals negotiated with no regard for the taxpayers' needs. The West Link bridge negotiations, recently analysed, showed taxpayers were not protected against the downside risk. We have seen poor project evaluation time and again.When infrastructure projects came up for evaluation a rosy picture of the benefits and wildly optimistic impressions of the costs were given. However, designers changed their minds halfway through because many projects were not properly designed. This has happened on major road and other projects. Right across the board, those same mistakes have been repeated. It is not just good enough for the Government to shrug and say these are confined examples of projects going wrong when, overall, it is achieving wonderful projects and to stop the begrudgery. This is money that costs the taxpayer dear, putting people on ordinary incomes to the pin of their collars to pay, mainly in spending taxes.The Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlights, time and again, computer systems, clearly designed without a proper understanding of their clients' needs. The designers did not consult the hospital, prison service or special needs users but ploughed ahead with a computer system that fell flat on its face.Tax breaks have been introduced without any proper evaluation of their benefits or costs and we know that many of them have been used solely for the great benefit of a few very wealth taxpayers. The Revenue Commissioners estimate that €200 million goes in property based tax benefits and 100 individuals took €74 million of that sum in each of the years evaluated. No intention of that kind was ever intended by the Dáil. The measures were never properly designed to protect the taxpayers' interests and this constitutes waste of the worst kind.Currently, the Dáil does not have the capacity to get to grips with the task of handling public spending and tackling the waste that occurs. The Dáil must be reinforced. Budget day is a charade or a political bearpit that has allowed projects to pass that should never have been presented in such a way because no evaluation had been carried out on them. Estimates are passed without any indication of the impact they might have on key performance indicators. The horse trading exercise of the Estimates process is not designed to reward efficiency. The opposite is the case and under the current Estimates process, crises and bad management are more likely to deliver more money to the spending Department than good management. That is ridiculous. It happens because there is no demand that money must follow performance. This must be changed.In the document, Who Cares?, Fine Gael has already tried to set out some of the changes we will make. With the Labour Party, we have begun the process of identifying the many changes that must be made. For instance, the Estimates process must be changed so that performance against key targets drives spending allocations. No one should get extra money without performing to commitments.The Comptroller and Auditor General's mandate must be changed. It is not good enough simply to report on money that has gone astray. The Comptroller and Auditor General must change the corporate governance in Departments and agencies so that it does not happen again. The Government must give him a mandate to strengthen corporate governance. We must have an independent unit in the Department of Finance to provide technical support and perform stress tests on the rosy evaluations coming from departmental and ministerial pet projects. It is not good enough that the Minister for Finance steps back and declares that it is a delegated responsibility. We have an interest in seeing that the proper systems are in operation.Deputy Deasy, who travelled with the Committee of Public Accounts to the United States, will deal with the issue of giving the Dáil greater access to more impartial information of the type that is routinely available to members of Congress. We must also examine our tax breaks and must have a system of annual scrutiny with the actual costs and benefits listed. I hope and am confident that the Minister will do something in that regard. We must have responsibility pinned on individuals, be it Ministers or senior managers. One cannot produce major policy initiatives without standing over the analysis underpinning them. Clearly, in the case of many ministerial projects, the analysis was not performed. People flew by the seat of their pants and then shunned responsibility when things went wrong. That is not acceptable. It is not being accountable in accordance with the mandate given by the electorate. We must see those sorts of changes and I hope we get the opportunity in Government to make those changes if the Minister does not respond.

All Governments have been obliged to deal with this issue over the last 20 or 30 years and it has come to light more frequently recently, particularly because of the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports. In many cases, while a Minister might bring a proposal to the Cabinet, no financial assessments are performed on much legislation. Although this should happen it does not and in many cases this has cost tens and hundreds of millions of euro in waste.My favourite example is the Official Languages Act. A council official threw a memorandum across my desk and asked how could the cost of translating every communication into Irish be paid for. He had a point, which goes to the core of the problem, which is that the House passes legislation, signs regulatory measures and budget measures are rammed through. However, no second-guessing is carried out on the Estimates put forward by Departments. In many cases, that is a big mistake and costs much money.When one compares our system to those in other countries, it comes as no surprise that we end up with tenfold overruns. In some cases, officials in Departments have no clue as to what a particular measure will cost when it is introduced in the House. They figure it out as they go along. In other countries, the cost of such measures is second-guessed.This was the reason for the Committee of Public Accounts's trip to the United States and the committee has been considering this matter for some time. The delegation met bodies like the Congressional Budget Office, boutique lobbying associations like Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Congressional Committee on Government Reform and the Auditor General of the United States. In California, the delegation met the director of finance for the Governor, as well as the state comptroller, the state auditor and people like that. We found the model we were looking for in the California Legislative Analyst's Office, in that it had a system whereby in some cases it would strongly contradict the financial estimates of the Governor and the executive office. It worked very well. Their system has evolved over 60 years and while we would not copy it, after 14 or 15 meetings — as the delegation had — one gets the idea. It became clear to us that the Oireachtas needs a second entity that produces estimates on a purely non-political and bipartisan basis for all Members and parties. That was the essential idea behind our trip to the United States.The committee will produce a report in the next three or four weeks, which will include a paper by Deputy Rabbitte. I am hopeful, although I am not holding my breath, the Government will look upon this constructively. I can make a good argument for Ministers to consider having an entity like that to help them with long-term planning within their Departments. If Ministers have a second Estimate, they could do so more constructively. In some of the meetings, people could not believe and were amazed that we had a parliamentary system lacking this feature. We found some models — one was a state auditor's office in California — where we were surprised to hear that on occasion, the legislature actually requested estimates from the state auditor's office. We were given a number of examples where this was done and the legislation subsequently folded immediately, because the person sponsoring it did not have a clue as to how much it was going to cost in the first place. That was a good lesson for us. If we look at this constructively and examine the cost to central and local Government of the legislation passed in the House in the last year or two, we will be getting somewhere as far as Government waste generally is concerned.The only reservation I have about this kind of system for our style of government is that in a couple of cases, the auditors intervened in policy formulation and seriously contradicted the executive branches. That would not suit our style of Government and would cause elections every six months. However, one could at least begin to think of putting together a separate entity within the Oireachtas that would create simple estimates for some legislative proposals, particularly the budget measures that are passed every year.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I welcome the opportunity to highlight again this Government's negligent use of taxpayers' money. I wish to concentrate on chapter 13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which deals with the West Link toll bridge. I commend the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their ongoing work. In his latest contribution, Mr. John Purcell has found €2 million for the taxpayer arising from the accounting discrepancies in respect of the accounts of National Toll Roads which resulted in the company's underpayment of royalties due to the State. That such a finding is no longer shocking says much about the prevailing attitude in the Government. It is an attitude that treats Government funds like loose change in a Minister's pocket.This reckless attitude has been particularly true of the transport area. It would be more of a shock had the report not included a transport issue of some kind. Already, we have seen over-runs on roads projects of billions of euro, a €171 million over-run on the port tunnel project and a major accounting discrepancy in the Department of Transport in 2002. Now we can add a serious accounting error in respect of the West Link toll bridge. It is incredible that neither NTR's internal audit function, nor KPMG, the firm's external auditors, nor the National Roads Authority nor the Department of Transport, including its internal audit function, spotted an accounting error which would have resulted in €2 million of taxpayers' money ending up in the pockets of NTR. Let us face it, when NTR is sitting on a nest-egg that will have netted it €434 million, it hardly needs a €2 million tip from the Government to help it along.The failure by KPMG to spot the underpayment is particularly disturbing in light of the fact that according to the Department's Accounting Officer, the provision of a certificate from NTR's auditors confirming the accuracy of the payment is an important part of the control system for the validation of the licence fee. It would seem that KPMG was extremely negligent in its auditing responsibilities in this case. The real question is how did this happen. KPMG is one of the largest accounting firms in the country, with a wealth of experience in auditing. I note from last weekend's Sunday Independent that there is likely to be an investigation into the firm by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland. This is the least that should happen in the circumstances and I look forward to hearing the outcome of that investigation. However, I ask the Minister if there is a role for the newly established Irish Accountancy and Audit Standards Authority in investigating this shoddy and negligent auditing.The two State parties involved are the National Roads Authority and the Department of Transport. Both parties have already had wake-up calls in recent years. In particular, it would appear that the Department has learned nothing from its embarrassing accounting error in 2002. The 2002 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed to a serious error in the appropriation accounts for that year due, in part, to a failure to carry out monthly reconciliation between bank records held by the paymaster general and the Department's accounting records. The correction of that mistake was meant to have heralded a new corporate governance regime in the Department where senior staff would have a greater monitoring role in financial control, with clear reporting lines.I am not sure how far that new corporate governance regime extended but surely it should include its roads section and the National Roads Authority. It is not unreasonable to expect it to investigate whether the taxpayer or motorist is overpaying NTR for the privilege of being ripped off at its toll bridge. The Minister needs to explain to the House how it is that for the second time in three years serious accounting errors went unnoticed by his Department. He now needs to outline what level of monitoring the NRA applies to such compensation payments and how that is monitored by his Department. He should thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff that many more millions did not go down the drain under his watch as it was caught early due to a level of vigilance clearly deficient in his own Department. However, there is a danger that the discovery of this €2 million will distract from the real story in the report. The real revelation from the report is just how big is the rip-off at the West Link bridge. The report tells us that for every €1 it costs to construct and run the bridge, the ordinary motorist pays €4.76 in tolls. In other words, the first 38 cent of the €1.80 toll charge will cover the costs of constructing and maintaining the bridge, while €1.42 is taken in profit by the company or in taxes by the Government. Motorists are paying almost five times the cost of providing the bridge, a rip-off in anyone's language.What the report clearly demonstrates yet again is that PPPs are not the Holy Grail of infrastructure procurement and provision. Recently, the Minister heralded a new form of contract, the so-called fixed price contract. However, fixed price contracts relate only to the original specification and changes, additions, changes of mind and so on are one of the main features of the shambles that is the Government's record on project cost overruns. We can have all of the fixed price contracts in the world but where professional competence is lacking and political accountability dodged they amount to no change. There is another even more fundamental point. Traditional government borrowing is likely to be the cheapest source of State funds. In other words, old-fashioned borrowing is likely always to be the cheapest source of funding for investment. So what is the point of PPPs? They may have a role in some circumstances but Government and ministerial proposals need to be benchmarked and evaluated, always against the traditional borrowing test. In addition, while cost estimates for projects procured through a PPP may seem more attractive initially, when 30 years of tolls are taken into consideration they are anything but attractive. PPPs are a Government accounting wheeze and a gravy train for consultants, accountants and bankers.The West Link bridge deal was one where the contractor took all of the construction risk, but without a formal tender process of the kind that is legally required today. The NTR West Link procurement was of the old kind. One had to be inside the tent and once inside, all the old faces and friends were there — people like Pádraig Flynn, George Redmond, Tom Roche and so on. Due to a ready-up of toll revenue between the State and NTR, the West Link will end up costing the taxpayer and motorist €1.1 billion, while the cost to NTR was a mere €231 million in today's prices. If this is the sort of sweet-heart deal allowed by PPPs, then they are costing the taxpayer dearly. There is a long way to go before PPPs can be trusted as a value for money solution to transport problems. I sincerely thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his work, and commend the motion to the House.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I move amendment No. 1:"To delete all words after "Dail Éireann" and substitute the following:—notes the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2004 Appropriation Accounts in the context of a gross expenditure by central Government of more than €41 billion in 2004 and that in line with normal procedure it will now be passed for scrutiny to the Committee of Public Accounts;—acknowledges the need to pursue best practice in the management of public expenditure to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and in this regard:—commends the initiatives taken by Government in recent years to promote more efficient and effective management of expenditure including:—the introduction in 2004 of rolling multi-annual capital envelopes for better management and control of public capital programmes and projects;—the publication this year of new guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector; and—the Minister for Finance's plans to introduce targeted reforms to the procurement of public construction contracts and reform and modernisation of the system for employing construction related consultants;—notes the measures taken to improve tax compliance; and—acknowledges the major improvements in public services since 1997 arising from the very significant level of resources allocated by Government over that period."I commend the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his role as external auditor of Government expenditure. The Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional officer who performs a highly important function, not just in his general audit of expenditure but in the value for money audits he performs that are the subject of specific reports. It is important to note that the subject of this motion is the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2004 Appropriation Accounts. There is a statutory requirement on the Comptroller and Auditor General to report annually to Dáil Éireann on his audit of departmental appropriation accounts. This report is accordingly not some major new report on Government waste but simply the Comptroller and Auditor General discharging his annual function. As is normal, the report focuses on certain issues that have come to his attention.Poor management of public expenditure and occurrences of wasteful expenditure are not acceptable at any time. This Government is as determined as any other Government in the past to redress problems that come to light. For example, the corresponding report in 1996 highlighted more than 40 issues of concern with the management of public expenditure across a range of Departments and agencies. This included cases where expenditure in excess of the Estimates on various programmes was incurred prior to the approval of local authorities and numerous incidences of unfunded balances on capital works. It also included separate instances of concerns with cost overruns on a number of local authority swimming pools and a number of national school projects.The 2004 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be put in the context of gross annual spend by central Government. In 2004, gross expenditure by central Government on public services, including the social insurance fund, amounted to about €41 billion. Of this, some €14 billion was in respect of pay and pensions, €11.2 billion in respect of social welfare, €10.1 billion in respect of health and €6.6 billion in respect of education. The items of expenditure mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report represent a small fraction of the total expenditure, probably less than 1% of the gross spend in 2004. I am not calling into question what the Comptroller and Auditor General reports and the need to follow up on his conclusions but we must keep this in that overall context.As Deputies are aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports are transmitted to the Committee of Public Accounts and form the basis for the questioning by the PAC of the Accounting Officers of each Department. The report of the PAC is in turn remitted to me for comments. My comments are relayed to the PAC after I have consulted the relevant Departments. This process enables the points made by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the PAC to be fully followed up and the introduction of necessary changes introduced in practice to remedy any shortcomings identified.I acknowledge that all efforts must be directed at ensuring as far as possible that value for money is gained and waste is avoided before the intervention of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I will outline the series of measures which the Government has taken in the recent past to improve value for money, especially in the area of capital investment. I will also outline the excellent achievements of the Government at both a macro-economic level and in the improvement of public services. The issue of the appropriate context for considering the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is readily illustrated by, for example, gross spending on the Education Vote in 2004 which was over €6.5 billion. As far as I can see none of this is commented on at all in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, but there is a reference to the somewhat technical issue of the status of certain pension schemes.The €6.5 billion was money well spent, investing in our children, the future generators of economic activity and prosperity, and paying the salaries of over 50,000 teachers, together with myriad other costs. I am sure that improvements can be made in the way it is spent, but the entire education system, from the Minister right down to the individual teacher and through to parental involvement, is focused on delivering a top quality education system. I must conclude that the €6.5 billion spent in this area is a very positive investment on behalf of taxpayers.In the case of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report raises a number of important issues in regard to fraud and overpayments, issues that will always arise given the scale of the operation and these will no doubt be pursued by the Department and the Minister. Gross expenditure by this Department in 2004, including the social insurance fund, was €11.25 billion. This was expended on payment of pensions and other social welfare benefits which are so crucial to the welfare of many of our citizens. Is the Opposition motion suggesting that this expenditure does not represent value for money or is being incompetently administered? I do not think so and I doubt if the beneficiaries of these payments would agree.I do not deny that there have been instances where better management of expenditure could have been displayed. I note the public comment today in regard to the HSE computer system for managing human resources. The overall cost of this project, estimated at €165 million since 1998, must first be seen in the context of total expenditure on the health service in that period since 1998 of over €61 billion during the development of the system. We are talking about a quarter of 1% of total health spend over the period. It is clearly a ludicrous proposition to suggest that the spend on this project has adversely affected overall health investment. The Tánaiste will speak on this issue in the debate tomorrow evening.What has emerged in regard to this particular project raises concerns in the Government and the wider public and I look forward to the forthcoming report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on this matter. The board and management of the HSE will have to reflect carefully on this report and take appropriate action. It is crucial that the board has in operation a modern and efficient management information system to underpin effective delivery of health care services. Through the Department of Health and Children, my Department has requested the HSE to review the approach to the implementation of this system and to seek less complex approaches to completing its implementation and subsequent ongoing operation. I understand that such a review is now under way within the HSE. My Department is also ensuring that the approach that was adopted for this project will not be used in any of the large health IT delivery systems being proposed by the HSE.The Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to tax evasion in the construction industry. I have consulted the Revenue Commissioners in the matter and wish to advise the House of the major activity being undertaken by Revenue in this area. I do not understand Deputy Burton's point of questioning the independence of Revenue.

At a general level the Revenue Commissioners recognise the tax compliance risks which arise in the construction industry and they have carried out an extensive programme of checks, audits and investigations in the industry in 2005.Revenue has reorganised itself along regional lines, with each Revenue region containing a special compliance district specifically set up to combat evasion. During 2005 to date, both mainstream Revenue auditors and special compliance staff have carried out substantial investigations of tax evasion in the construction industry. The extent of these activities is evident when we consider that Revenue's east and south-east region devoted 50% of its available audit resources to a special investigation of the construction industry, in the first half of the year the region completed almost 500 audits of principal and subcontractors yielding approximately €12 million so far and the region carried out a further 360 compliance checks, 37 site visits and 92 visits to subcontractors newly issued with certificates of authorisation, colloquially known as C2s. By the end of the year, this region alone will have completed over 1,000 construction audits, 800 compliance checks and 70 site visits. Similar activity is taking place throughout the country. Those are the facts.The Dublin region's special compliance staff carried out 35 site visits and 1,650 compliance checks in the first six months of this year.

I am informed that the construction industry will form a major part of Revenue's compliance and audit work in 2006.In recent years, 12 instances of relevant contract tax fraud were investigated by Revenue. Because of the particular circumstances of two instances, it was considered appropriate to refer these to the Garda for further investigation. One alleged fraud identified collusion among 97 persons, including nine principal contractors. A Garda inquiry is ongoing into this abuse and also the abuse of C2 certificates. The second fraud involved 24 identified persons and companies, including eight principals. Garda inquiries are ongoing.The remaining ten cases where serious suspected abuse of the relevant contract tax system was identified were referred for investigation by Revenue's investigation and prosecutions division with a view to prosecution. To date, one of these cases has resulted in a court conviction and the defendant was sentenced to 240 hours of community service. In two other cases, the defendants failed to appear in court and bench warrants were issued for their arrest. The remaining seven cases are under active investigation by Revenue's investigation and prosecutions division.

This allows for the better monitoring of compliance behaviour of principal contractors and for Revenue to more effectively police the operation of the C2 certificate of authorisation system.Turning to the issue of better management of public expenditure, I wish to remind the House about the important measures which have been taken by the Government in the recent past, at the initiative of my Department, notably in the area of capital expenditure. The Government is acutely conscious that we must get optimal return for the significant levels of capital investment to which we are committed. Currently, we are spending close to 5% of GNP on capital investment funded by central Government. This is around twice the European average and it will amount to over €36 billion in the period 2005-2009.The Government accepts it has a clear duty to promote a framework that will deliver value for money for this investment. In doing so the Government is resolved to learn from past inadequacies in some instances, including any highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is my strong contention as set out in the Government motion that we have been proactive in this regard and that the fruits of this action are already visible. In budget 2004 my predecessor Charlie McCreevy introduced major reform of the system of allocating capital investment resources. Five-year funding plans for each ministerial area were agreed. Provision was made, for the first time, to allow for carrying over to the next year unspent allocations up to a maximum of 10% of these capital provisions. The objective of the new system is to introduce relative medium-term financial certainty for Ministers and implementing agencies so they can better plan and execute their capital programmes. This is particularly important given the scale and timeframe of many of our modem infrastructural projects. The carry-over system allows agencies to move away from the tendency to rush end-year expenditure, as was the case under the old system.The multi-annual framework is underpinned by requirements designed to ensure that the substantial financial commitments in the envelopes are complemented by a commitment by Departments and agencies to implement all the guidance laid down by the Department of Finance regarding the appraisal, procurement and management of capital projects. In essence, the new system is promoting better management of capital expenditure. It provides relative financial certainty and underpins best practice in the management of programmes and projects. The response to the new system has been uniformly positive.Earlier this year I announced revised guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector. These are testimony to the Government's commitment to maximising value for money from capital expenditure. They complement the multi-annual capital envelope system.The new guidelines are designed to encourage a better approach to appraisal and management of capital programmes and projects and to reflect best practice. Key features of the new guidelines are that all projects over €50 million must undergo a full cost-benefit analysis and all capital programmes with an annual value in excess of €50 million and of five years duration, or more, will, for the first time, be required to be evaluated over the course of each five-year cycle.Those who state that another layer of ex ante approval may be necessary before capital projects proceed should acquaint themselves with the guidelines. The new capital appraisal guidelines contain all that is necessary to assist proper costing, appraisal and efficient execution of projects. For example, they explicitly state, in reference to the appraisal process, that “the cost of the project should be the expected outturn cost, including construction costs, property acquisition, risk and contingency” and that “the cost of possible future price increases and variations in project outputs should be factored into the calculation of project costs”.On public procurement, the Government has announced measures designed to ensure that there will be a much closer alignment between the agreed tender price and the final outturn cost of construction projects. We want to achieve much greater cost certainty in construction projects generally. To achieve this outcome, the Government has decided to introduce changes in the operation of public sector construction contracts. We intend, following consultation with the industry, that public sector construction projects will be tendered competitively on the basis of a fixed-price lump sum contract in which appropriate construction risks are identified and transferred to contractors. Under this system, the amount of variation or "extras" will be limited to the greatest extent possible. There will be a higher up-front capital cost with greater certainty for the Government as client and the contractor as provider. The final outturn cost will be much closer to the contract terms.We are also modernising the system for employing consultants, including engineers and architects, for example, to decouple professional fees from project costs. The existing system, which sees consultant costs increasing as project costs increase, is not the way we want to do business in future. We are proposing a new system which will involve movement away from the practice of paying consultants a percentage fee based on the final cost of a project in favour of requiring professionals to tender for fees on a fixed lump sum basis. Competitive fee bidding is being introduced in a way that should not compromise design quality.The construction industry is being consulted about the way these changes will be implemented. It is high time best practice followed in the private sector is implemented in the public sector also. I am satisfied that both the Government side and the contracting side will benefit from the certainty introduced under the targeted arrangements.We are already seeing evidence of significant improvement in management of capital projects. In the key transport area, for example, major projects are now coming in on or below budget and on or ahead of schedule. The Monasterevin, Cashel, Ashford-Rathnew and Ballincollig bypasses comprise some more recent examples. In this regard, the relevant yardstick for measuring cost overruns on capital projects is the contract price and not the original pre-tender estimate that may have been drawn up many years previously and that may bear no relation to the specification of the project tendered for or completed.On expenditure Estimates, I agree in principle with the proposition that there should be more accountability in this House for outputs achieved for the financial inputs approved by the House. I am in consultation with my Government colleagues on that matter. The objective will be to facilitate early examination by the House and its relevant committees of the macro-economic and fiscal background to budget policy formation and promote a more informed debate on the various Estimates for each Department.Since 1997, the Government's economic policies have greatly increased employment and prosperity. The resources generated by this prosperity have been applied in a way that has benefited all sectors of society. In the area of transport, there was virtually zero Exchequer capital investment in public transport in 1997. We have invested a cumulative €2.3 billion since then and this has led to major increases in capacity, especially in the greater Dublin area. These include the introduction of the Luas which has a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum and a major expansion of the DART. We have halted the neglect of our railway network generally by increasing capacity and making our railways safer. Further improvements are under way and much more will be done in the years ahead.In the health service, since 1997 total discharges for 2004 in the inpatient and day care categories have increased by more than one third; the number of day care treatments has doubled; the number of consultant posts has increased by almost 50%; there has been a 145% increase in the number of occupational therapists; there has been a 75% increase in speech and language therapists; and the number of physiotherapists has almost doubled. These large increases in medical personnel are delivering more treatment across a whole range of areas. Nobody should suggest the work these personnel do represents a waste of resources.There have been improvements in services at all levels, including education, since 1997. The pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 22.7:1 to 17.4:1 at first level and from 16:1 to 13.6:1 at second level. There are 7,000 more teachers employed. There are almost 6,000 special needs assistants, which number rose from a base of virtually zero when the Government took office. The number of students taking up third level education has risen from 95,000 to almost 140,000. There has been a massive increase in capital investment in our schools and colleges. It has more than quadrupled, from €120 million to almost €540 million this year. Just last week, the Minister for Education and Science and I announced a major new round of PPP investments in 22 first level and second level schools. Having listened to Deputy Shortall, I am interested to hear about the policy formation process that exists between the Labour Party and Fine Gael.I could refer to other services such as social welfare, services for the disabled, housing and many more in respect of which there have been major service improvements. Any objective overview would conclude that, since 1997, the Government has presided over the greatest ever advance in the quality of our public services while reducing the burden of personal income tax, and dramatically reducing debt levels.The Government has a good record of achievement in delivering results. We are resolutely committed to value for money. As I have outlined, we have put in place a robust framework for appraising and delivering capital programmes and projects that will reduce the risks. I intend to ensure, as Minister for Finance, that we will continue to manage the economy in a way that delivers increased prosperity for all our citizens, that allows increased resources to be used for improved public infrastructure and that allows for improved social services aimed at addressing the needs of both the less fortunate in our society and those of the ordinary citizen.

As my colleague said, it also directs us to areas that require more rigorous attention.The Government has presided over an era of unprecedented growth. The Opposition has obviously no experience of this kind of growth. It is more practised at recession and stagnation and talking this country down. Owing to its lack of experience, it failed to appreciate that massive unprecedented growth provides inevitable challenges to any system. It is important that the checks and balances are built into the system to highlight errors and prevent them happening. More bureaucracy, which will stifle initiative and lead to further delays on much-needed projects, is not required. The key function of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is to provide vital information to the Government for the improvement of the management of the taxpayers' hard-earned money.It is very easy for the Opposition to move from data to blame.

It makes a key contribution to growth, competitiveness and balanced regional development. In the context of such a diverse remit, my objective has been to commit and deploy available resources to programmes which contribute to economic competitiveness, sustainability and social and regional balance.My Department's overall capital investment envelope for 2005 amounts to approximately €128 million. In the lifetime of this Government, investment has funded major successful projects in areas such as fishery harbour infrastructure, coast protection, broadband infrastructure, marine research, port infrastructure and energy conservation.A particular example of successful project and financial management is the new €50 million development at Killybegs fishery harbour centre. This development represents the largest investment in fishery harbours since the foundation of the State. Killybegs is now a world class fishing harbour with considerable potential in the commercial sphere. The Government's investment in Killybegs is creating new opportunities in support of development in the north west region, an area requiring continued investment.My Department's capital investment programme also funded the state-of-the-art research vessel, Celtic Explorer, which was delivered within budget and on schedule. This Government’s commitment to developing our national marine and maritime research capability has been unparalleled. These achievements demonstrate the public sector’s ability to efficiently and effectively manage and deliver on large capital projects, on time and on budget.Both the Government and I as a Minister welcome the scrutiny of public expenditure by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I fervently believe in the imperative on all of us to secure value for money. The annual report focuses on a small number of projects and programmes within my Department. Voted expenditure as a whole was over €40 billion in 2004. My Department's programme areas referred to in the report account for approximately 1% of departmental income and expenditure. The majority of projects provide value for their money to taxpayers and quality delivery, on time and within budget, in all public infrastructure projects.Government Departments and the public sector generally do not operate in a vacuum when it comes to the management of public expenditure and the delivery of investment programmes. As outlined by the Minister for Finance, detailed guidelines exist for the appraisal and management of capital investment projects. Rigorous appraisal of capital projects is the key to assuring the Government and the taxpayer that our investments are delivering value for money. The evidence of this value for money is all around.The Government has introduced significant improvements in respect of budgeting for capital investment. It has established a new system of multi-annual capital budgets designed to improve the allocation and management of such expenditure. The new system provides certainty about funding over a multi-year time scale and has helped increase efficiencies. It underpins better planning, sharper decision making and tighter management of budgets across programmes over the medium term.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	508	There was the money spent on the e-voting system, the €150 million we heard about today and the millions of euro referred to in this blue document. This is taxpayers' money — apart from those liable for tax from whom the Government has not collected tax — but this arrogant Government seems to have forgotten that. It is interesting that there are more than 500 social welfare frauds documented but only two tax frauds in the building industry. This is a good example of the Government's priorities. It does not care about big people not paying their taxes but it cares a great deal about the little people who it can catch for breaches under the social welfare system. That is the attitude we have heard from the Government representatives.I refer to the way in which Exchequer revenue could be well spent in the education system. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, correctly said there is no wastage in the education system. That is true except for the wastage on school projects built under public private partnerships, which was the subject of a separate report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It showed that such projects cost up to 13% more than if the schools had been built in the normal way. Yet an announcement of further school projects to be built under public private partnerships was made last week. Apart from such wastage, there is not an overspending of Exchequer resources in the Department of Education and Science. That is mainly because the school principals try to spend small amounts of money that are not sufficient to cover insurance and other costs they have to meet. The majority of parents try to cope with the cost of paying for school uniforms and books. We have the second largest classes in Europe and school buildings that are in need of repair. An example of the inadequacy of school accommodation was given on a radio programme today when it was highlighted that the door to a classroom cannot be opened because the teacher has to sit behind it as there is not sufficient space to accommodate the teacher and the pupils.There are a litany of areas in education where money could be well spent. As a percentage of GDP or GNP among the member states of the EU and members of the OECD, Ireland has one of the lowest levels of expenditure on education, as shown by recent figures. Furthermore, our level of expenditure on education as a percentage of our national wealth is decreasing. Investment in education, if we had the necessary resources, is an area where we could see results. Instead, large amounts of money are being wasted which could be invested at the coalface in areas such as education. That is what is scandalous about such wastage and overspending, which annoys members of the public. That is an example of a bad Government. The Government has considerable Exchequer resources, according to the litany we heard from the Ministers who spoke. Other Ministers will probably tell us about all the money the Government has spent on various projects tomorrow night, but it has not spent such money well. Highlighting expenditure is the purpose of this document. The Government has not spent money in the provision of smaller classes and better school buildings which would make a real difference to people's lives. That is what is shameful about such wastage.We need to remind the Minister, Deputy Cowen, that when the finances were handed over to this Government by a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and his colleagues, they were in good order in terms of the inflation, the national debt and other indicators. The Celtic tiger was well on its way to being established at that stage. What the Government has done with the finances since then is what is covered in this and other such documents. The Government has wasted Exchequer resources and not invested them in areas such as education where such resources could have been properly allocated for the future of this country. That is the real scandal about which we are talking.

I listened with incredulity to the comments of members on the Government side. It is clear they have been too long in Government. They have no notion of the public attitude and anger to the profligacy that is now the hallmark of the way the Government conducts its business. Waste is of no importance. We saw this attitude displayed again by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. His response was effectively to say "so what" and on other issues "aren't we able to do it and isn't there pucks of money anyway." That is the subliminal message. It is the grossest of all ironies that the partner in Government is the Progressive Democrats whose reputation was made on the notion of fiscal rectitude and minding the public purse. It is a partner in this profligate Government that has no regard for the public purse or public money.What has angered people who are struggling to cope with everyday living, particularly in an area such as health, is that the Government promised faithfully 30,000 additional full medical cards, but not one of those has been delivered. Fewer people now have a medical card than the number who had a medical card prior to the last election. The Government promised 100,000 doctor only cards, but again due to the Government's incompetence in the delivery system the announcements are made——

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	514	Whatever number was promised, not even two, never mind 200,000, have been issued. Such announcements are made and the date for the issuing of these cards is moved forward and then moved forward again. Not one of them has been delivered.People from my home town and from other regions who have to travel long distances for cancer treatment are angry when they see hundreds of millions of euro wasted. Yet we tell them we cannot afford to provide cancer treatment in the regions. There are so many ways in which such money could be properly spent that such wastage annoys people. There is never an accounting for such wastage. Nobody is responsible for the e-voting fiasco or the opening of Media Lab that were announced with great fanfare and then disappeared, so to speak. The attitude is that nobody is responsible and so what. Nobody was responsible for the National Aquatic Centre, the roof of which blew off. We are the only country in the world where our National Aquatic Centre is an outdoor pool. Nobody is responsible for the computer systems which cost multiples of the original estimated cost and which simply do not deliver, but the attitude of Government is "who cares". It uses the Bart Simpson style defence, "Nobody saw me, you cannot prove it and it was not me."I want to deal with the issue highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the national treatment purchase scheme. Chapter 14 of that report acknowledges that in 1993 I introduced the precursor of this scheme, the waiting list initiative. I wanted to introduce an emergency scheme to deal with the backlog of waiting lists by negotiating within the State and externally for operations to be done in order that procedures could be carried out. I negotiated for that within the State and as far away as Belfast, and people were helicoptered from Cork. That was a short-term initiative to tackle waiting lists while we built up the capacity in the public health service to deliver within this State. What the Government has done is to change that into a permanent scheme. There is a problem in doing that, and I wish I had more time to develop this point. The problem is in buying procedures from hospitals whose waiting lists are generating the demand. In the report the Comptroller and Auditor General asked how hospitals have a waiting list problem for a given procedure at a time when they have a capacity to undertake a substantial number of additional treatments funded by the national treatment purchase fund. There is an extraordinary dichotomy in trying to square that circle. That is an extraordinary and fair question.In my last comment in what could have been a long speech on an important report, I wish to say the following to the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. Unfortunately, I cannot say it to him face to face because he has left the House. Having delivered his salvo, he does not want to hear a response. He talked about all the harbour development and so on. I live a few miles from Kilmore Quay, where his decision has destroyed a community of scallop fishermen. When will they get compensation and when will the funding which he is able to slosh around with no accountability be available to give real relief to the people whose lives he has destroyed?
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I support the motion which calls on the Government to bring forward proposals to improve the system of public expenditure decision making to get better value for taxpayers' money and to tackle ongoing waste of public money. I want to focus on the expenditure on the Irish language in this context.An Coimisinéir Teanga, Seán Ó Cuirreáin, in his inaugural report stated that during 2004 various public bodies had expressed their concerns to him as regards the lack of competency in Irish among their staff. An tUasal Ó Cuirreáin went on to state that the widespread lack of fluency in the language among so many public sector employees was of no little concern to him, especially in the light of the investment that had been made in the teaching of Irish and in the country's educational system. He says that hundreds of millions of euro are being invested, perhaps as much as €500 million annually in the teaching of Irish in the educational system, in line with English and other subjects. It is estimated, he says, that almost 1,500 hours of tuition in the language is provided to school pupils over a period of 13 years from the first day of primary school to the end of second level.He comes to the kernel of the issue when he says this clearly raises the question as to whether the State is getting value for money from this investment, if it is true that so many are getting through the educational system without achieving a reasonable command of the Irish language — even students who succeed in getting a high grade in Irish in the final examination. An tUasal Ó Cuirreáin believes there is an urgent need for a comprehensive impartial review of every aspect of learning and teaching Irish in the education system. There is far more to it, however, than just a review of the education system. The fundamental flaw of State policy is the absence of a clear and attainable objective as regards learning the language, and more importantly, using it in an environment outside the school. There is widespread soft goodwill and support for the Irish language, but there is also apathy and even hostility towards it.Too many people are not prepared to engage in any meaningful way with the language and salve their consciences by not questioning the status quo. Seán Ó Cuirreáin is right in saying there must be an urgent root and branch review of the education system, but there must be a clear context for it. It does not matter what happens in schools or colleges if there is not a universal sense of ownership of the Irish language among the people and an appreciation that it belongs to everyone and is a national treasure from a cultural heritage and responsibility viewpoint. Not only is there considerable money being spent on the language in the education system, but the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will provide €91 million for Irish and the Gaeltacht this year. It is reported that the number of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht has collapsed from 250,000 to 20,000 since the setting up of the State.The recent report of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta also gives cause for concern. It found that 54% of children in Gaeltacht schools use Irish as their usual form of communication, 35% speak more English than Irish, 15% speak mostly English and 4% speak English only. The real question is about not how much is being spent on the language, but how effectively and efficiently we spend it. Between 600 and 700 Departments and State agencies will come under the provisions of the Official Languages Act. This was enacted without any real costing being carried out as regards its full implementation. This is not the way to develop cost-effective policies. We are losing the war as regards the revival of the Irish language and we cannot allow this to continue. The Government needs to urgently decide what our attainable objective is as regards the place of the language in our community and how we can effectively and efficiently deploy resources to achieve it. There must be appropriate mechanisms to monitor progress and adapt where programmes are not working out. Wishing matters to be all right on the night in the face of decline is not good enough.I have no real optimism that anything will be done by this Government. It has been in office since 1997 and matters continue to get worse in the context of the language. We must look at this area if we are not to lose this national treasure. I am afraid the Government is caught in a time warp, trotting out policies that belong to another age, which did not even work then.

I am amazed at the responses from the Government side of the House. I cannot believe that the Ministers who have so far spoken can say what they have said with straight faces. My only conclusion is that they are having a laugh behind the scenes and that they are laughing in the corridor. There must be a laugh somewhere. At no time in the history of this State has there been so many areas where public spending over target has been questioned and where there has been no accountability or attempts made to explain the reasons for such over-expenditure to the Oireachtas and the people.The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is rushing around the country buying property with gay abandon like John Wayne on a binge. He is doing this because he has an agenda. He has to perform to this agenda as defined under "Parlon country". I wish him well because in two or three years time someone will ask serious questions as regards what he was doing, how he spent and what type of value he got for money. I guarantee that questions will be raised about it.

We know where that went. Reference has been made to the original costings of the Luas. Why do projects cost so much more than was anticipated in the first instance? What has gone wrong? Are there no pocket calculators on the Government side that they cannot work it out for themselves? Can they not get some kid in first or even second class to work out precisely where they are going wrong? Why can they not ask the questions?The toll on the M50 is a very interesting performance. If anyone wants to know the value to the public for money from the M50, they need only observe from the toll plaza for a couple of hours any Friday. They can compare the situation there with any other country. I do not know why that has not been done or why the motorists are being punished. I do not know what they have done wrong. I do not know why somebody has not told motorists why they deserve to be punished in this fashion by this Government.Reference has already been made to the aquatic centre. Many questions were raised in the Committee of Public Accounts before it was built because of the manner in which it was being handled. Questions were also asked about the associated leisure centre. It was all washed away, however, swept to one side in an enormous welter of consultant generated positive publicity, which is what the Government lives on. We live in a society not governed by Ministers or the Oireachtas but by the reports of consultants, of which there are many on Government shelves. Doubtless, there are more to come, but they are very costly. They will be even more costly. The one fact to emanate from all that is that there will be no Minister accountable to this House at any time in the future.The Dublin Port tunnel is surely the laugh of all time. Before the project got under way Deputies pointed out to the then Minister for Transport that something was wrong with the plan and the tunnel was not high enough for certain trucks. Sadly, no action was taken and the result has been the recent daft intervention of the Taoiseach when he called for a ban on all trucks which cannot be accommodated in it. The reason was his desire to avoid the embarrassment of being forced to admit we built the tunnel incorrectly. The submissions I and many Deputies made provided adequate technical information to enable the Government to address the issue in good time. The reason it chose not to do so was because it no longer cares.

I will conclude on the issue of e-voting to which other Deputies also referred. If one were to rake over all the embers, one would not find a better example of daft expenditure by daft Ministers who had no intention of ever reporting on their antics to anyone. Instead, they hired firms of consultants to back up their decisions. The consultants duly complied because they were being paid large amounts of money for that purpose. The €58 million of taxpayers' money poured down the drain has been sidelined by the most recent waste of €170 million on another daft project in the health service. What has been the response from the Government? I am sorry to note we have heard nothing from the benches opposite, nor are we likely to see a Minister of the current Administration stand up and accept responsibility.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	527	It must be his week on the stump. The matter I raise is the lack of spaces for people with intellectual disabilities despite increased funding. During the past year, Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Stanton, and I spent months debating complicated disability legislation and trying to persuade the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to amend it. Not only did he show no interest in making changes but he showed no interest in the Bill.All the points I and my colleagues raised during debate of the Disability Bill on the lack of spaces and services for people who suffer from disability have been borne out by a report published by a Government body, the National Intellectual Disability Database, charged with collecting the type of data which is essential in planning a proper service for people with intellectual disabilities. Its latest report is staggering. It notes, for example, that 2,270 people with intellectual disabilities are still without a day service, full-time care service or both. It also reports that no plans were made to respond to the high birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s and higher life expectancy rates among people with disability. It notes that the proportion of people with a severe disability who are aged 35 years and over increased from 29% in 1974 to 49% in 2005. The report also states that the multiannual funding announced in last year's budget has made no inroads into reducing the number of people with intellectual disabilities requiring a day care or residential place.It is astonishing that none of the points made by Opposition Deputies during the debate on the Disability Bill, when every nuance of life for people with a physical or intellectual disability was discussed, was taken into account. Despite the fanfare with which the new Bill was introduced, nothing has happened and it has still not been signed into law. The Minister informed us that we must wait until proper services are in place before he will sign the Act section by section. Opposition Deputies specifically asked that he avoid this course of action but he has insisted on pursuing it.In response to the recent report of the National Intellectual Disability Database, Deirdre Carroll, chief executive of the National Association for People with an Intellectual Disability, NAMHI, stated:The Government is just throwing money at the situation without looking at the level of need. Some people will spend their lives without a service while others will die in large institutions because there is no money to move them out.After watching on RTE last night the television documentary, "Asylum", which dealt with the few remaining residents in one of our mental institutions, it is clear the Government must make mental health services a priority. It is, however, so flush with money it no longer cares what it does. As the Private Members' debate demonstrated, a fraction of what the Government has wasted would be sufficient to put in place all the services required for those with intellectual disabilities. It is estimated that a further €400 million is needed to provide a sufficient number of services and residential and day care places for people with an intellectual disability.While advances have been made in securing additional day care places, progress thus far has come about as a result of continuous pressure from those who have fought on behalf of people with disability. Instead of making a generous gesture, the Government has shown a grudging attitude to providing additional services. According to the report of the National Intellectual Disability Database, 284 day places, in addition to almost 2,500 residential care places, will be required over the next five years. One judges a society by how it deals with its most defenceless citizens. This Government has a very poor record on intellectual disability. The amount of money it has squandered would have gone a long way towards fixing what desperately needs to be put right.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his long service in the House and share the sentiments expressed by my colleagues in this regard.I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the provision of health and personal social services for people with intellectual disabilities. The recently published report of the National Intellectual Disability Database 2005 indicates that 23,914 people with an intellectual disability are registered on the database, 97% of whom are in receipt of a health or personal social service. Despite this record level of service provision and significant investment in services from 2000 to 2002 and again in 2005, it is acknowledged that nationally 2,270 people are without a major element of service, that is, a day service, full-time residential service or both.In November 2004 the Government announced that disability and mental health services would be prioritised under the Estimates for new health initiatives in 2005. An additional sum of €40 million was allocated to services for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism in 2005 as part of a five year multiannual budget for the sector and is being used for the provision of additional day, residential and respite places for people with an intellectual disability and the transfer of people with an intellectual disability from inappropriate placements. Additional funding of at least €50 million will be allocated each year in the period 2006 to 2009 to disability and mental health services. The new funding will provide additional residential, respite and day places, improve specialist support services and meet costs associated with moving individuals to more appropriate placements. This multiannual approach, with its firm commitment to future funding, is unique to the disability service.It is anticipated that the additional investment in disability services over the coming years will significantly address the shortfalls in service provision identified by the report of the National Intellectual Disability Database. This is proof of the Government's commitment to the national disability strategy and people with disabilities.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I want to be associated with remarks congratulating the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his long service.I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this issue but I am a little amazed and shocked that no Minister with a health portfolio is in the House to discuss this serious matter.The issue of Monaghan General Hospital has taken on a new urgency over the past few days. A proposal to restructure the male medical unit at the same time as the surgical ward will seriously curtail the ability of the hospital to continue a realistic level of services that would justify the staff and consultant numbers, maintain a hospital on call service and retain junior hospital doctors and anaesthetists.I ask that both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, take the same interest in Monaghan General Hospital as they have taken in hospitals such as those in Nenagh and Ennis, where they have individually committed large sums of money.On 15 September last the consultant surgeons belonging to the joint departments of surgery of Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital unanimously requested that the Health Service Executive bring Monaghan General Hospital back on call for acute surgical emergencies. This followed the unprecedented instance where 30 patients were waiting for treatment on trolleys in Cavan General Hospital's accident and emergency department. On 23 September the board of Monaghan General Hospital supported the same request and asked the HSE — formerly the North Eastern Health Board — to review the wrong decisions and correct them by putting Monaghan General Hospital back on call for acute surgical emergencies as Cavan General Hospital had advised medical practitioners not to send patients to Cavan if at all possible — I have proof of that in writing.Can the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, advise what doctors are to do and, above all, what rights have patients in this position? Can she advise what will happen if two thirds of the beds available in Monaghan are to be closed at one time? Can she further advise what discussions she had — of course she cannot do so because she is not here — with the HSE regarding this project and its implications for long-term care? Does she realise that the proposed programme will do little to restore a proper general hospital service and more to establish a home for the elderly? How can she justify the fact that the treatment room, which was promised for last February and construction of which finished in July, has not yet opened? Can she ignore the statement by the consultants that putting Monaghan General Hospital on call for acute surgical emergencies would alleviate pressure on beds, both at Cavan General Hospital and at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda? Will she make sure that adequate resources are made available, including providing theatre nurses in Monaghan General Hospital for evening and night duties? Does she realise that many people owe their lives to the service of Monaghan General Hospital? Unfortunately it can be clearly seen that lives were put in danger, if not lost, during the period that the hospital was on call.The Taoiseach is entitled to get respect and to be thanked for his involvement in the peace process in Northern Ireland. However, no other hospital in Ireland has served a more difficult area or as long a Border region, and it is impossible to understand why he and Deputy Harney have ignored this vital organisation which is based alongside the N2 motorway leading from Dublin to Derry, the fourth largest city in the country. With Dungannon Hospital now closed, and the hospital in Omagh under threat, the services of Monaghan General Hospital are even more crucial. Industry, sport and every other aspect of life depend so much on proper general hospitals. With a permanent peace, Monaghan General Hospital could have a much broader service base and that should be our aim.How can Deputy Harney stand over the waste of €150 million on computerisation that did not work while funding is curtailed to a few million euro for a hospital as important as that in Monaghan? How can she stand over the minimum use that is being made of a brand new theatre in Monaghan General Hospital as she pours out money to the national treatment purchase fund to do the same job?Would the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is from a rural constituency, like to stand beside a widow, with her handicapped child, whose husband was only 100 yards from Monaghan General Hospital but was not allowed in because it was off-call? That is the type of occurrence we face on a daily basis. It is impossible to understand how the Taoiseach could come to Cavan to hold a parliamentary party meeting and not mention Cavan General Hospital or Monaghan General Hospital, or how Deputy Harney still has not mentioned the group in charge of trying to restructure Monaghan General Hospital in a positive way. I just want straight answers.

I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides an opportunity to outline to this House the position with regard to the provision of surgical services across the Cavan/Monaghan hospital group.Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Responsibility for the provision of services at Monaghan General Hospital rests with the HSE.The Department is advised by the HSE that the policy approach in respect of surgical services for the Cavan/Monaghan hospital group was set-out in the 2004 report of a steering group established by the former North Eastern Health Board. The steering group was representative of all the key stakeholders and included consultant surgeon, radiologist and physician representation from both hospital sites. The Department is further advised that the steering group's recommendations were unanimously approved by its members.

The HSE has informed the Department that it does not intend to review the steering group's recommendations in respect of surgical services.The steering group recommended that major and emergency surgery should be carried out in Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital should provide selective elective surgery. The report's recommendations reflect advice from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In accordance with the recommendations of the steering group, a full surgical team based in Cavan will provide services at Monaghan General Hospital, in the form of selective elective surgery on a Monday to Friday basis.The HSE has also recently appointed a non-practising lead consultant surgeon at the Cavan-Monaghan department of surgery whose remit is to oversee an implementation plan arising from the RCSI's advice on the future configuration of surgical services in Cavan and Monaghan. Measures to achieve this include the appointment of surgeons to fill existing or forthcoming vacancies. All these posts will be structured, eight sessions at Cavan Hospital and three sessions at Monaghan Hospital.In accordance with the steering group's recommendations, the hospital returned to 24-hour seven-day medical cover in January 2005. A third consultant physician has been in post since November 2004 and five new anaesthetic non-consultant hospital doctors have been recruited to facilitate the return of the hospital to medical on-call. The arrangements, which I have outlined and which are being put in place by the HSE, are designed to enhance the overall level of surgical services across the Cavan/Monaghan hospital group.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. There are two matters to mention here, the first of which is to state this is an essential service and make the case for that. The second is the failure of Government to even recognise its responsibility and the utter ease with which it has been able to pass the buck to the HSE. Our worst fears about the Health Act 2004, that there would be no transparency or accountability, have come true. If the funding is not provided, the HSE can do nothing. As long as the money is not provided, the position will remain unacceptable.The former Western Health Board area is very large. It includes three areas unique in Ireland, in that there is no ambulance base within 20 miles of them. The criteria laid down indicate there should be an ambulance base within 20 miles of all areas so people can get the help they need within the golden hour, a period recognised and laid down in medical circles as the time needed to give a person the best chance at life. Outside of the golden hour the chances of things going wrong are much greater and the chance of recovery less.The issue for those who protest against the Hanly report and other changes is about getting services within the golden hour and getting essential definitive services that will make the difference between life and death, or life with disability or a cure. We face this difficulty through the lack of an ambulance service in the Mulranny-Achill area, which has a scattered rural hinterland. It takes two hours for an ambulance to come to Achill, never mind the chance of a person getting treatment within the golden hour. This is an utter scandal and has been raised with both the current and the previous Minister.We put the same questions and get the same answer every time that this is a matter for the HSE and has nothing to do with the Minister who has no responsibility for the people of Mulranny and Achill who are dying. While Nero fiddled, Rome burned. While the Minister for Health and Children evades responsibility patients die. I got involved in helping set up a voluntary ambulance service in our area, but because of legalities etc. this service is no longer available. We are dependent on the State to provide a service. There is an onus on the State to provide an ambulance service that will provide service within the golden hour.The situation is the same in Roscommon and Tuam, the two other areas that do not have an ambulance base within 20 miles. Four babies were born in my house because mothers could not make it to the hospital in time. People have died because of the distances involved and because of the delay in getting to the services in Mayo General Hospital, a considerable distance away.We have been getting the same answer from the Minister since I came into the Dáil that the HSE is responsible for this area, not the Minister. For what has the Minister responsibility? What is the point in having a Minister for Health and Children if she will not take an interest in this issue and provide the necessary funding to ensure we get an ambulance service for the Mulranny-Achill area?

I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the facts relating to this issue.The Deputy mistakenly alleges certain failures on the part of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. It is important, therefore, to clarify for the House the follow-up action taken by the Department and the Health Service Executive pursuant to the particular parliamentary questions which the Deputy tabled and which were replied to by the Tánaiste on the basis that the matter was one for the executive and had been referred to it for direct reply.The Deputy's question of 14 June was referred to the executive and resulted in it issuing a letter to the Deputy on the matter dated 6 July. The Deputy raised the same matter in a question on 29 June and this was also referred to the executive in accordance with the Tánaiste's reply on that occasion. The executive replied to the Deputy by e-mail on 9 September, reiterating the position as conveyed to him previously. I am advised the Deputy was in telephone contact on the morning of 29 September with the executive to discuss the matter with the person who wrote to him on 9 September.This sequence of events demonstrates that the Deputy's question to the Tánaiste was promptly referred to the executive and elicited responses to the Deputy setting out its current position on the provision of the particular service concerned. There was no failure on the part of the Tánaiste or her Department in regard to this matter.

In that context, it must make its own decisions on the use of resources and the setting of priorities for service development in Mayo or anywhere else in the country.The Tánaiste has put particular emphasis and importance on the executive providing timely replies and information to Oireachtas Members. This is an initiative on which her Department has been working with the executive and which led to the establishment of the executive's parliamentary affairs division. A primary task of this new division is to ensure questions referred to the executive are responded to as soon as possible and that the issue of replies is monitored and followed up where necessary. The Department continues to work with the executive to develop its parliamentary affairs capability.I emphasise that while these arrangements facilitate referral of questions to the executive, they do not give a role to the Tánaiste in the decisions which inform the replies provided directly to Deputies, as these are a matter for the executive in accordance with its responsibilities under the Act.

#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I take this opportunity to congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on the great and singular honour of completing 44 years service to this House.I speak on behalf of the people of Kanturk and ask the Minister for Education and Science the current position on the amalgamation of the two national schools in Kanturk. This proposal has been ongoing between the Department and the boards of management of the two primary schools since 2001. In many cases amalgamations have been proposed by the Department rather than on the ground, but in Kanturk the boards of management have been willing to ensure the amalgamation between the boys' and girls' national schools takes place. The technical assessments have been carried out on these schools and I understand a further technical assessment took place of the buildings this summer.I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is here as he has special responsibility for the OPW and I understand the Department is to liaise with it in sourcing a greenfield site. What is the position in that regard? Kanturk is a growing town and it has been shown that the current facilities are on too small a site. Some 200 houses are at construction stage in Kanturk and the extended school is necessary to ensure the proper education of the young people of the town.Kanturk is signalled as a decentralisation town and the regional office of the OPW, the departmental responsibility of the Minister of State, is earmarked for Kanturk. I believe a site has been earmarked for that office and negotiations are ongoing between the OPW and the site owners to finalise the details on it.Kanturk is a growing town with a great spirit. It is a local provincial town, the capital town of Duhallow, with a good community spirit. We would not like to see the growth of Kanturk held back in any shape or form as a result of not having proper primary school facilities. As I said at the outset, the boards of management of both schools have been willing to work with the Department of Education and Science on the amalgamation plans. Sadly, the Department has not supplied the desired information in recent years. I ask the Minister of State to outline to the House the detailed proposals which have been made to date. He should emphasise to the Minister and the Department the importance of ensuring that this project goes ahead as a matter of urgency. Many stages of the planning process need to be completed speedily before the amalgamation can take place. A new greenfield site needs to be bought so that the project of constructing a new educational facility in Kanturk can be progressed as soon as possible.I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue. I would like progress to be made in respect of this matter, which is of great importance for Kanturk, as speedily as possible. I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on completing a record service in the House.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I am pleased to outline, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, the position regarding the proposed amalgamation of St. Colman's boys national school and Scoil Náisiúnta Chlochair, which are the two primary schools in Kanturk, County Cork.St. Colman's boys national school, which had an enrolment of 106 in 2004-05, is staffed by a principal, three mainstream assistants, a permanent learning support teacher and a permanent resource teacher. The enrolment of Scoil Náisiúnta Chlochair, a girls school that enrols boys in junior and senior infants only, has increased in recent years from 156 pupils in 2000-01 to 170 pupils in September 2004. It is staffed by a principal, five mainstream assistants and one permanent learning support and resource teacher.The authorities in both schools are in favour of the amalgamation and the preferred option locally is for a new school building on a greenfield site. A technical assessment of the existing sites has accepted that there is a need for a new site, as neither of the existing sites lends itself to the development required to facilitate the amalgamation.The proposed project has been assessed and banded in accordance with the Department's prioritisation criteria, which were revised last year after consultation with the education partners. The provision of the accommodation that is necessary to facilitate agreed amalgamations is assigned a band 1.4 rating, which will positively influence the timescale for the delivery of the project when a site has been acquired.The long-term projected staffing on which the accommodation needs of the amalgamated schools will be based will be determined by officials from the Department of Education and Science in consultation with the two school boards. A detailed assessment of demographic trends, housing developments and enrolment trends will be undertaken to ensure that the capital funding that is provided will deliver accommodation that is appropriate to the needs of the amalgamated schools into the future. When that has been decided, the appointment of a design team for the project will be considered. The project will then be considered for progression in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2005-09.I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the proposed amalgamation of the two national schools in Kanturk.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I would like to set out the background to this incident. The case involved the slaughter on-farm by the herdowner of some 4,000 pigs over a five day period following the discovery by Department veterinary inspectors of quantities of Carbadox on the farm and an admission by the herdowner that he had spread the substance on the floors of pig pens. The movement of any animals from this herd, except under specific licence from the Department, had also been prohibited by the Department in the period preceding slaughter in order to protect public health. Notwithstanding this, some pigs were moved to slaughter plants and products from some of these did in fact enter the food chain. Carbadox is a carcinogen, cancer-causing substance, which is banned by the EU and deemed to be unsafe at any level. Prosecutions have since been issued against the herdowner alleging a range of offences relating to the use of this feed additive and other matters, including the illegal movement of pigs from the farm. The herdowner has issued proceedings against the Department under two headings.While there was no question of legally permitting the pigs to be slaughtered for human consumption, the Department wrote to the herdowner's solicitors on 7 May 2002 explicitly stating its willingness to allow him to pursue the option of his making arrangements, acceptable to the Department, with a dedicated plant for their slaughter. However, he did not pursue this option. Instead, he sought permission to slaughter the pigs himself on his farm on welfare grounds. He had discussed this approach with Department veterinary inspectors and they were satisfied that he understood fully what would be involved and that he displayed both the competence and confidence to undertake the task.During the five day period, two veterinary inspectors, including an animal welfare expert from the Department, visited the farm on numerous occasions in order to assess the ongoing slaughter operation. A non-veterinary official of the Department was present on the farm during the five day period in question, whose primary function was ensuring proper disposal of the carcases, that is, to ensure they did not enter the human food chain. At no point during the slaughter process did the herdowner express concerns or disquiet on animal welfare grounds about the slaughter method or seek to suspend operations on grounds of professed animal welfare concerns.An official of my Department observed the herdowner use a lump-hammer to slaughter a small number of pigs and ordered the practice to cease immediately. The implement was seized and only returned to the farmer when the entire slaughter process was completed. With regard to the attempted suffocation of the pigs, records indeed show that the herdowner was legally instructed to maximise the ventilation capacity of his units in order to minimise the negative welfare impact associated with increased liveweight capacity of the units. Department veterinary staff did not report any attempt to deliberatively deprive the pigs of air.The circumstances in this case were highly unusual. On-farm slaughter of animals in any number is an exception rather than the rule and occurs only in extreme circumstances, for example, the FMD outbreak in Cooley, where it is not possible to move the animals to a dedicated slaughter plant or where there are compelling reasons, for example, fear of disease spread, for not attempting to so do. In this particular case, the herdowner had decided to slaughter his animals on-farm and the Department considered at the time that it could not legally have forced him to have the operation conducted in a slaughter plant. In view of the foregoing, I do not consider it appropriate to conduct the investigation on the lines suggested by the Deputy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I met the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Fisher Boel, in Ireland last June to discuss the Commission proposals on the reform of the sugar regime, the overshoot of the special beef premium and the management of the dairy market.As regards sugar, I emphasised my total opposition to the Commission proposals, which had been published just prior to the Commissioner's visit. I explained in detail the adverse impact these proposals would have on sugar production in Ireland. In response, the Commissioner explained the rationale behind the proposals. Both sides accepted that the proposals would be subject to difficult negotiations in the Council of Agriculture Ministers in the months ahead. I restated my position subsequently at the Council in July and am endeavouring, in co-operation with like-minded member states, to seek a more balanced outcome, which will take Irish interests into account.I had previously been in contact with the Commissioner on the special beef premium overshoot, and at the meeting in June, we reviewed the ongoing technical discussions. The Commissioner expressed her understanding of the problem and subsequently responded positively, allowing me to announce a special payment package. Taken in conjunction with the Exchequer funding, which is the subject of a supplementary estimate, the package is worth approximately €17.5 million.The concession agreed by the Commissioner only addressed the position of the second age category, as she was adamant that no concession was possible in the first age and bull category in light of the legally binding ceiling of 1,077,458 animals. However, the final outcome means that payments under the 2004 special beef premium scheme will amount to almost €340 million, compared to €290 million paid under the 2003 scheme.I also used the opportunity to emphasise my serious concerns about the Commission's management of the milk market and called for careful consideration of the effect of these management decisions on the competitiveness of the dairy industry. I particularly disputed the extent to which these adjustments were warranted, arguing that downward pressure on institutional supports limits the sector's ability to fully exploit opportunities to export milk products to international markets, and reduces the returns available to farmers.I will continue to urge the Commissioner to use all the market management tools at her disposal to provide the stability that the dairy sector now requires to consolidate its competitiveness and future investment capacity and, particularly, to maintain and expand international market share.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I am fully committed to the development of an all-Ireland animal health strategy, the ultimate objective of which should be the free movement of animals on the island and the development of agreed policies to control animal disease and to facilitate trade.There is already a long history of co-operation between the Administrations North and South on animal health issues. The Administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have pooled resources to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The foot and mouth disease emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, ministerial and political levels.The establishment of the North/South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy.The main objectives of the Council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.A total of nine policy working groups have been established at official level under North-South arrangements to take forward various initiatives. The remit of these groups includes TB and brucellosis, TSEs — BSE and scrapie, veterinary medicines, other zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-Border aspects of fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the development of similar approaches to combat the introduction of animal diseases, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation on issues such as contingency planning.In addition to the above, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two Administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE, avian influenza and cross-Border fraud while the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council includes representation from DARD. On cross-Border fraud, the two Administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions against alleged offenders and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.It is my intention to pursue this matter further at a political level with the Right Honourable Lord Rooker, following on from my discussions with Ian Pearson, Minister of State in Northern Ireland.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I presume that the Deputy is referring to the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council which took place on 19 September. On that occasion, the sugar reform proposals did not feature on the Council agenda.I expressed my serious concerns about the proposals when I met with Commissioner Fischer Boel on her visit to Ireland in June, and again at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July. I emphasised that the price cuts proposed are too severe, that the reforms should be based on a longer lead-in time for the Everything But Arms agreement and that it would be preferable to await the outcome of the WTO meeting in Hong Kong in December before seeking to conclude an agreement on sugar reform. I have also continued to remain in contact with like-minded colleague Ministers from other member states who are opposed to the reform proposals.The proposals as they stand would have serious implications for Ireland and I have made clear that they are unacceptable. They will again be discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers on 24-25 October. My overall objective is to ensure a more balanced agreement, which will take Irish interests into account.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The horticulture sector is a very dynamic one that has grown to be a significant entity within the overall agricultural industry. Farmgate production is now close to €300 million with retail sales of €650 million. Demand for processed and semi-prepared produce has increased dramatically over the last number of years and is expected to continue. The horticulture sector is also very labour intensive with some 10,000 people employed across the production and distribution chain. My Department will continue to contribute directly to this sector by providing plant health services, enforcing quality standards and through grant assistance.A very significant contribution towards the development of the sector is made through the grant aid schemes for capital investment on farms under the national development plan. The scheme aims to promote the diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products, facilitate environmentally friendly practices and improve working condition. Since 2001 over €8 million has been paid to 400 horticultural producers to upgrade or develop new facilities. This grant aid has been a major catalyst for investment and growth in a sector which is making a very significant contribution to the rural and national economy. This year a €6 million grant package will fund projects to the value of over €17 million. All areas of horticulture are eligible for the scheme, covering mushrooms, protected crops, nursery crops, field vegetables, soft fruit, apples, seed potatoes and beekeeping.Demand in the consumer and food service sectors is buoyant, both for fresh and prepared chilled produce and convenient value-added products. The retail value of prepared horticultural produce was estimated to be €59.8 million in 2004, representing a two-fold increase on 2001, and there are real investment opportunities and challenges for development of this sector. For the first time this year, projects in the fruit and vegetable sector have been prioritised in the scheme of aid for the marketing and processing of agricultural products, which supports capital investment to enhance competitiveness and added value.In addition, horticulture producers benefit from EU aid under the producer organisation scheme. Over €6 million will be paid to 12 recognised producer organisations this year. The development of producer organisations under EU regulations has made a very important contribution to the development of the sector as it enables producers to benefit from their combined strength in the production and marketing of their product.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	548	Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Limited, which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. Irish Sugar Limited places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specific tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.Ownership of the sugar quota had never been an issue in the past because the relevant EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quota. Speculations about quota ownership only arose when the Commission, in July 2004, raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility, in the context of their initial thinking on reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, voiced strong opposition to the idea of cross-border mobility and I am pleased to say that it does not form part of the Commission's legislative reform proposals, which were published in June. In any event, the EU Commission has confirmed that the quota is not an asset owned by the member state or any other party but is simply a mechanism for regulating the market.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	549	Agreement was reached in Geneva in August 2004 on a framework setting out the structure and general content of the new World Trade Organisation, WTO, agreement. The detailed implementation of this framework has been the subject of ongoing negotiation at technical and political level and the aim is to conclude an agreement at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. I am satisfied that the framework agreement secured the benefits to Irish farmers of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy and represented a satisfactory outcome from Ireland's point of view. My over-riding objective in the further negotiations is to ensure that the terms of a new agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. More specifically, my priorities are to ensure that: the phasing-out of all forms of export subsidies will be applied in parallel, as provided for under the framework agreement, and that the phasing-out period will be as long as possible; Ireland's agricultural exports will remain competitive in the EU market through the continuation of adequate levels of tariff protection on imports from third countries; and the EU's system of direct payments which, following decoupling, qualify as non-trade-distorting, continue to be exempt from reductions under the new agreement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	550	The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for energy policy and is primarily responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels. Nonetheless, the development of the biofuels industry is a cross-sectoral issue impinging on several policy areas, for example those related to environment and fiscal policy as well as energy policy, and involving several Departments and agencies. I am acutely aware of the central role which agriculture can play in the provision of necessary raw materials for the production of biofuels. These raw materials can include oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet for liquid transport biofuels, forestry by-products for wood biomass, and other farming by-products such as meat and bone meal and tallow for energy-heat generation and biodiesel respectively.Factors such as the increasing cost of oil, the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the opportunity for farmers to explore alternative land uses following CAP reform mean that the potential of this area must be fully explored.For the purposes of contributing to the development of policy on biofuels, my Department in conjunction with COFORD and Teagasc has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. In general, the production of energy crops for biofuels will have to be demand led and production by farmers will only occur if the economic returns are greater than those offered by traditional crop enterprises. The production of liquid biofuels from energy crops is not economic at current oil price levels. However, the scheme recently announced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for mineral oil tax relief on pilot biofuel projects has stimulated the production of oilseed rape for biofuel.The exploitation of wood resources for energy purposes, mainly for heat or electricity generation, offers significant potential. There are also significant opportunities for using by-products of farming and food processing for bioenergy purposes. Approximately 140,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal is produced annually and its use in place of fossil fuels could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 19%.I am anxious to encourage further research to assist the development of the biofuels industry and I have arranged for research projects on biofuels and other non-food uses of crops to be included in the latest call under my Department's research stimulus programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Low levels of land mobility have been a long-term feature of Irish farming. The number of land parcels placed on the market annually is relatively small, and Ireland's strong economic growth has increased demand for all forms of land. Average agricultural land prices for 2004 were €16,156 per hectare, an increase of 12% on 2003. While there was an exceptionally high increase of 25% in the fourth quarter of 2004, it was partly reversed by a decline of 12% in the first quarter of 2005. The CSO does caution that these figures are based on a very small amount of agricultural land placed on the open market each year; only 0.1% of agricultural land was sold in 2004.Traditionally, Irish farms are kept within families and are transferred through gift or inheritance. This combined with the low level of land sales means the main option for those who wish to expand their holdings is through leasing. In 2003, almost one-fifth of all agricultural land was leased with one-third of Irish farms leasing-in some portion of land.For meaningful farm planning, leasing is best done on a long-term basis, and the Government has a number of incentives in place to encourage this and to improve the overall levels of land mobility. There are generous income tax disregards for farmers who lease-out land on a long-term basis. Capital gain tax retirement relief is available to farmers over 55 years who dispose of their farming business, while farmers over 40 years can avail of a rental income tax relief on leases of five years or longer. These measures help improve the availability of land to farmers who wish to increase their scale of production.There are also a series of measures in place to help reduce start-up costs for new entrants. These include a number of generous grants and tax reliefs. For young, suitably trained farmers there are a number of attractive schemes including an installation aid grant of €9,520, 100% stamp duty relief on land, a 90% relief from capital acquisition tax, CAT, and 100% stock relief for four years for eligible farmers. I believe these are pragmatic measures to help facilitate those who wish to enter agriculture or those who wish to expand production.

During the summer we broke the previous record for participation and we now have over 47,000 farmers in the scheme. Total spending on REPS amounted to €208 million in 2004. Expenditure this year, with three months still to go, has already almost matched that. I am hopeful that we will have close to 50,000 farmers in REPS by the end of the year, which will account for this year's voted provision of €271 million.I would urge all farmers who are not already in REPS to consider it seriously. It offers real benefits not only to them but also to the environment and society in general.

Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants by 1 December next. This will allow any allocations to be reflected in the single payment scheme payment which is scheduled to commence on 1 December 2005.The Single Payment Advisory Committee comprising representatives of my Department, Teagasc and the farming organisations met recently to discuss the rules for allocating the national reserve. Further contacts will take place on this matter before a final decision is made.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	554	As I have indicated previously, I regard the Commission's proposals for reform of the sugar regime as unacceptable and have made this clear directly to the Commissioner and in the Council of Ministers.The production of ethanol from sugar beet is a possible alternative outlet for farmers but, as matters stand, Irish Sugar Limited has arrangements in place to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which has been upgraded for that purpose. The question of an alternative use for sugar beet does not therefore arise at present.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	555	Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Limited, which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. Irish Sugar Limited places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specific tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.Ownership of the sugar quota had never been an issue in the past because the relevant EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quota. Speculations about quota ownership only arose when the Commission, in July last year, raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility, in the context of their initial thinking on reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, voiced strong opposition to the idea of cross-border mobility and I am pleased to say that it does not form part of the Commission's legislative reform proposals which were published in June. In any event, the EU Commission has confirmed that the quota is not an asset owned by the member state or any other party but is simply a mechanism for regulating the market.The decision by Greencore to close its plant in Carlow and consolidate all of its sugar manufacturing in Mallow was a commercial decision taken by the board on 12 January 2005. The company advised my Department two days in advance of the board meeting that a proposal concerning the future of its two processing plants and involving the likely closure of the Carlow plant would be put to the board for decision.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I am fully committed to the development of an all-Ireland animal health strategy, the ultimate objective of which should be the free movement of animals on the island and the development of agreed policies to control animal disease and to facilitate trade.There is already a long history of co-operation between the Administrations North and South on animal health issues. The Administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have pooled resources to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The foot and mouth disease emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, ministerial and political levels.The establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy.The main objectives of the council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.A total of nine policy working groups have been established at official level under North-South arrangements to take forward various initiatives. The remit of these groups includes TB and brucellosis, TSEs — BSE and scrapie, veterinary medicines, other zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-Border aspects of fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the development of similar approaches to combat the introduction of animal diseases, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation on issues such as contingency planning.In addition to the above, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two Administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE, avian influenza and cross-Border fraud while the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council includes representation from DARD. On cross-Border fraud, the two Administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions against alleged offenders and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.It is my intention to pursue this matter further at a political level with the Right Honourable Lord Rooker, following on from my discussions with Ian Pearson, Minister of State in Northern Ireland.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I expect to introduce shortly an amendment to the relevant national legislation to allow for the spreading on non-pasture land of digestate produced by composting and biogas plants using animal by-products in their inputs. These arrangements are being introduced primarily in the context of EU legislation that allows the digestate produced in such plants to be spread on non-pasture land. In introducing this amendment, I have had regard to the declining numbers of BSE cases here and the need to provide productive outlets for the disposal of certain animal by-products where this does not pose a risk to public or animal health.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I propose to take Questions Nos. 140, 155, 162, 177, 185 and 199 together.The draft regulations on veterinary medicines which were circulated by my Department in August for consultation are designed to give effect to EU Directive 2004/28 and to reform aspects of the existing national regime. My Department has received written submissions from most of the main stakeholders and has also subsequently met with many of these stakeholders as part of the consultative process. In addition, as required by the relevant legislation, the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee will meet shortly to consider the draft regulations, following which I will make final decisions on the issues involved so that the regulations can be brought into force by the transposition deadline.I am aware of the views that have been expressed about the possible impact of the draft regulations on competition in the supply of veterinary medicines, in particular, from the requirement in the EU directive that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals must be subject to prescriptions. I should explain, however, that the directive also includes a provision for exemption criteria to be adopted at EU level, which will provide a mechanism for certain categories of medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement. The EU has not yet adopted a decision on the exemption criteria but must do so before 1 January 2007. Pending this decision, existing national prescription and distribution arrangements may remain in place.It is my intention to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible and my Department has made a submission to the EU with a view to retaining ‘off prescription' in Ireland all products, other than intramammaries, which currently enjoy this status. The draft regulations published by my Department provide that veterinary medicines, such as wormers and certain vaccines, will continue to be available off-prescription for the time being and in practice, this means that, apart from intramammaries, we are retaining the essence of our existing national prescription and distribution regime. In view of this, it is not necessary at this stage, for competition reasons, to extend the range of persons who may be permitted to prescribe. I will, however, review the regulations and in particular the provisions relating to the categories of persons who would be permitted to prescribe medicines in the light of the exemption criteria that are agreed at EU level in due course.With regard to the recommendations of the Competition Authority, many of these recommendations are based on the misapprehension that all veterinary medicines will be subject to a prescription only regime from 1 November, which I have explained is not the case. However, their views will be taken into account, along with those of the other stakeholders, in my final decisions. My position is that while regulations in this area must, of necessity, give primacy to protection of public health and animal health and welfare, it is also important to minimise costs to the farming sector and, with this in mind, my Department has included a number of important changes in the draft legislation to achieve this objective. Among these are: the removal of inflexibilities in the existing prescribing regime which will reduce the need for mandatory farm visits by practitioners and extending the life of a prescription from the current 31 days up to six months will facilitate the farmer and his-her vet, where appropriate, anticipating needs, particularly for management type products; the new requirement for veterinary practitioners to issue written prescriptions in all cases and to ensure that farmers are made aware of the cost of medicines as distinct from the professional service given and to facilitate the purchase of medicines at premises other than that of the veterinary practitioner; and permitting licensed retailers to supply for prescription only medicines for the first time.It is evident from the foregoing that my Department is doing everything possible, in so far as it has the flexibility to do so, to create an environment to ensure that there continues to be competition in the supply of veterinary medicines.In relation to availability of veterinary practitioners to issue prescriptions, the draft regulations published by my Department will, as I have said earlier, substantially retain the existing regime in relation to off-prescription products until I January 2007, which means that, with the exception of intramammaries, medicines currently available generally from pharmacies and licensed merchants will continue to be available from these outlets until that date. I should point out that veterinary practices are primarily commercial entities and their location is driven by commercial realities. In so far as Government involvement is concerned, I would also draw attention to measures in the new Veterinary Practice Act, which should help to address any shortages in Irish trained vets. For the first time, the Veterinary Council is being enabled to recognise qualifications from applicants in third countries generally and this, taken also with the recent enlargement of the EU, should make for the improved availability of practitioners from outside the State to meet any shortfalls in the supply side.With regard to the regulatory impact assessment, the EU directive which is sought to be transposed via these regulations pre-dated the introduction of the regulatory impact assessment initiative by the Government. Notwithstanding this, my Department has carried an assessment of the impact of the draft regulations in the course of the consultative process with the stakeholders and I will be taking account of this in my final decisions on the regulations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	559	Bord Bia promotes the Irish food and drink industry in an increasingly competitive global food market. Competition in the market is becoming even more intense with greater trade liberalisation, competition from low cost countries and increasing concentration at retail level. Allied to this consumer requirements are changing with more emphasis being placed on health, convenience and well-being.Bord Bia is responding to these challenges with the development of a more strategic approach to identifying new and emerging markets and sectors. An independent strategic review of the activities, operations and structures of Bord Bia has been completed. Resulting from this review and following extensive consultation, the board has drafted a strategic plan to guide its development of the next five years in the light of changing dynamics in the marketplace. While the plan does not envisage a radical departure from Bord Bia's current role and remit, however, it does envisage a strategic repositioning of the organisation to enhance the capacity to deliver strategic market development, promotion and information services.Specifically, it commits Bord Bia to the development and delivery of a range of strategically-focused market development programmes and services to build on and support its existing range of programmes and services. The strategic plan, which does have resourcing implications is being examined by my Department.In relation to the marketing of beef, one of our main food exports, the plan identifies the importance of securing more value-added markets within the EU. I was pleased that a proposal which I presented to the Select Committee for Agriculture on 28 September for a Supplementary Estimate that included €800,000 for Bord Bia, comprising €500,000 for a beef marketing strategy and €300,000 for initiatives in the new member states and on Asian markets, was commended to the Dáil and will be voted on today. I am confident that the board's strategic approach to future development will enable it to address successfully the many market related challenges facing the food and horticulture industry which in 2004 accounted for exports of some €7 billion.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Significant progress is being made on implementing the Government's decision on the decentralisation of my Department. The decentralisation programme includes the relocation of the Department's headquarters to Portlaoise, transfer of the local office in Cork city to Fermoy and the rationalisation of the Department's five Munster laboratories to Macroom.Practically all the Department's Dublin based administrative staff members, approximately 65, who have expressed an interest in moving to Portlaoise are either there or are in the process of moving. Transfers into and out of the Department via the central applications facility, CAF, have now begun. My Department has initiated the transfer process for all the civil servants who had chosen Portlaoise as a first preference. Other Departments and offices have initiated transfers for staff from my Department decentralising to other locations.I announced the site for the location of my Department's new offices in Portlaoise on 23 May 2005. Construction is due to commence in 2006. Temporary accommodation to meet my Department's immediate needs in Portlaoise has been sourced and additional temporary accommodation is being sought to cater for further phases of decentralisation in 2006, 2007 and 2008. At the request of the central decentralisation implementation group my Department is finalising implementation plans for the move of the Department's local office in Cork city to Fermoy and the rationalisation of the Department's five laboratories in the Munster region to a single complex in Macroom.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	561	There were 126 cases of BSE confirmed in 2004 compared with 182 in 2003 and 333 in 2002. To date in 2005 there have been 50 cases which represents a decrease of 47% on the number of cases — 96 — discovered in the same period in 2004. The majority of the confirmed cases were in animals born prior to the introduction of the additional controls in 1996 and 1997. The age profile of BSE cases as well as the reduction in case numbers indicates that these additional controls have been effective in significantly reducing the exposure of animals born after 1997 to the infectious agent. It is anticipated that the incidence of disease will continue to decline as cows born prior to 1998 leave the system.Where BSE is confirmed, a detailed epidemiological investigation is undertaken and the feeding regime used is an essential element in that investigation, particularly in confirmed cases where the animal was born after the feed controls were reinforced.To date, 16 animals born after 1997 have been diagnosed with BSE. In addition, ten cases were confirmed in 1997 born animals of which a number were born before all the reinforced measures were put fully in place that year. My Department had foreseen the likelihood that individual cases such as these would, from time to time, arise. This is likely to relate to circumstances specific to the farms in question and need not conform with the general trend as the incidence of the disease in the national herd recedes. There is, however, no basis for suspecting that these cases are indicative of either a systemic failure in controls or of a reversal of or deviation from the overall positive trend in relation to BSE in Ireland.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	562	Beef imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced, first, in countries and, second, in premises currently listed and approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's Food and Veterinary Office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks laid down in the harmonised rules prescribed at European level, and must be accompanied by the prescribed veterinary health certification from the competent authorities in the country of export. We have comprehensive beef labelling regulations at EU level which apply to all beef produced within the Community and imports from third countries. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as "Origin: non EC" along with an indication of the third country in which the slaughter took place.My priority in this area is to extend the existing beef labelling laws to require information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to all consumers in the restaurant and catering sectors. I put specific proposals to Government at the end of June for a legislative framework to facilitate this, by way of an amendment to the 1947 Health Act. This will be introduced under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 which is before the Oireachtas this session. The appropriate regulations are being worked on concurrently and it is my intention to have these cleared at EU level as soon as possible. When the Act is amended and the regulations made, country of origin information will be available to consumers in respect of all beef served in restaurants, hotels and the whole catering sector in Ireland on a mandatory basis.In the meantime, the various representative bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and both of the vintners groups, following discussions with my Department, have all agreed to recommend to their members the introduction on a voluntary basis of a mechanism for providing consumers in their premises, with information on the country of origin of the beef served there, in advance of the mandatory legal requirement. This agreement was finalised last week and these organisations are currently at various stages in that process. I expect the voluntary system will be in place in the very near future.During the discussions with the industry representatives, it was stressed that the information on the origin of the beef served or supplied on their premises must be clearly displayed at the point of consumption, either on the menu or on a poster, chalk board or similar display so that it can be easily read and clearly understood by all consumers. The information must include all countries from which the premises is sourcing its beef and all statements of origin have to be verifiable and be capable of linkage with the delivery records to the establishment.These requirements are enforced by the relevant authorities at border inspection posts and, within Ireland, by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	563	By the closing date of 16 May 2005 for the single payment scheme, my Department had received almost 149,000 applications.It will be appreciated that as all farmers who wished to activate their entitlements and-or claim payment under the scheme were obliged to submit an application form, the number of forms submitted includes an element of double-counting. For example, where a farmer who had established entitlements during the reference years had subsequently transferred those entitlements, both the transferor and the transferee were obliged to submit application forms. I am very satisfied with the progress being made in processing these application forms, particularly given the complexity of the new scheme and the fact that, at the same time, staff have had to process the old animal-based schemes to their conclusion.An indication of progress made in the processing of single payment scheme applications can be gauged from the high level of disadvantaged area scheme, DAS, applicants already paid under the 2005 scheme given that the DAS application form was incorporated into the single payment scheme applications form. Some 85% of DAS applicants have been paid in the past week, a figure that compares favourably with previous years. The first date on which payments may be made under the single payment scheme is 1 December 2005.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 171 together.I am anxious to facilitate trade in live sheep, which has to take place in accordance with EU rules governing such intra-Community trade. Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of, inter alia, Council Directive 2003/50/EC, which amends Council Directive 91/68/EEC regarding reinforced controls on the movement of sheep and goats.My Department has been in discussions with the Irish Farmers Association in an attempt to overcome the difficulties posed by the residency and standstill certification requirements. In an effort to progress the issue, my Department has written to the EU Commission seeking an amendment to the certification requirements that I accepted should address the concerns of farmers and exporters. We are currently awaiting a response from the Commission.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	565	The EU regulation covering the current early retirement scheme will expire in December 2006. Take-up has fallen far short of expectations, and an expenditure review of the scheme carried out by my Department in 2004 raised a number of questions about it.The Council regulation on rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 again includes provision for member states to operate early retirement measures. No decisions have yet been taken regarding the schemes to be operated in Ireland under this regulation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 182 together.For 2006, I have decided that the modulated funds should be used on a once-off payment under the disadvantaged areas scheme. This requires EU approval and is under current consideration by the EU Commission. My decision reflects the importance of the disadvantaged areas scheme in ensuring continued agricultural land use in the less favoured areas. This in turn leads to economic and environmental benefits.For the 2007-13 period, the use of modulated funds will be considered in the context of the new rural development strategy and programme to be drawn up for that period.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	567	Pending agreement at EU level on labelling thresholds for GM seeds, a voluntary agreement exists among most of the member states which prohibits the importation of GM seeds. This agreement, which Ireland is party to, is underpinned by a requirement that each consignment of imported seed of what are deemed to be at risk crop varieties must be accompanied by a certificate from a reputable laboratory indicating that, in as far as it is detectable, GM seed is not present in the consignment being imported. The at risk crops are oilseed rape; beet; maize soya bean; cotton; and tomatoes.EU legislation governing the growing and distribution of GM products has been jointly adopted by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and as such is binding on all member states. This legislation specifically prohibits the unilateral declaration of a GM free country and any efforts to bring about a  de facto situation must be based on a voluntary agreement or on sound scientific grounds.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I am aware of both the confirmation of BSE in an animal born in Wales in 2002 and the reports of BSE being transmitted in an experimental sheep flock in the UK. There are no particular implications for Ireland as a result of either incident. To date there have been 16 cases of BSE confirmed in this country in animals born after 1998, the most recent born of which had a registered date of birth of March 2001. Similarly, the reports of BSE in a sheep flock, while informative, have no particular implications for BSE policy in Ireland.The occurrence of BSE in animals born after 1998, referred to as BARB cases, born after the real ban, does not take from the decline in the incidence of the disease here and throughout the European Union. The epidemiological evidence, both here and in the UK, suggests that a tight control on the use of mammalian meat and bone meal plays a very significant role in reducing the incidence of the disease. It has been suggested in the UK that these BARB cases may be related to imported feed as the controls, which have been in place in Ireland and the UK since 1996, were not introduced EU-wide until 2000. Given the incubation period for BSE, we will, at EU level, have to wait another few years before the full effect of the complete ban on the use of processed animal proteins can be measured.Apart from the aforementioned case in the UK, no case of BSE has been identified in the EU sheep population despite the fact that testing, which is capable of discriminating BSE from scrapie, is now mandatory throughout the EU. Were such a case to be identified in this country consideration would have to be given about how to deal with the affected flock and the progeny of the affected animal.Although a case of BSE has been confirmed in a single goat in France, no such cases have been experienced in Ireland and should such a case be confirmed here, decisions about control measures would have to be taken.The Department continues to operate a range of controls at various locations to protect public health and to eradicate BSE and scrapie.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I discussed the WTO agriculture negotiations and Irish concerns in relation thereto at a bilateral meeting with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development on 23 June 2005. The Council of Agriculture Ministers, which reviews the situation on a regular basis, discussed the developments in the negotiations at its meetings on 18 July 2005 and 19 September 2005, both of which I attended. At both of these Council meetings I outlined my concerns that the Commission should continue to adhere to the mandate on agriculture given to it by the Council and that it should not deviate from this as the negotiations proceed. I spoke, by telephone, with the Commissioner on 24 September.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	570	My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has overall responsibility for matters within the competence of the Environment Council. The proposals being developed by the Commission on sustainable use of plant protection products follow from the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and are being developed following detailed consultation with interested parties.While there have been no representations made to the Commission, officials from my Department participated in a stakeholders' conference on the subject in November 2002. A response to a questionnaire issued to canvas regulatory authority opinion on a range of possible strategies was submitted earlier this year. My Department continues to be supportive of sustainable initiatives that reduce risks for man, animals and the environment associated with crop protection.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	571	As provided in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the main objectives of the food institutional research measure, FIRM, are to provide a base of information and expertise in generic technologies that supports innovation and product development in the food industry, and assists consumer protection by ensuring that product development is underpinned by attention to food safety and quality. General calls in 2000 and 2004 and a targeted call in 2001 covered: development of technologies to build a more competitive, innovative, consumer-focused and sustainable food production and marketing sector; development of the scientific knowledge to underpin effective food safety practices at all stages in the food chain; consumer foods technology; innovation in functional foods; cheese diversification; production of new food ingredients; nutrition; and new technologies for added-value meat products.The most recent call, which closed in May 2005, prioritised proposals under food safety and beverages themes as it was considered that these areas offered good potential for research, which would advance the objectives of the measure.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	572	Under the CAP, decoupling arrangements for direct payments, farmers can for the first time in many decades, now focus more clearly on the market-related element of their incomes, confident that the single payment will provide an assured income stream. This will create a significant incentive towards quality production with producer-processor relationships the key. In such a context there will be a need for even greater emphasis on good breeding policies, payment related to quality and integrated supply and purchasing systems thus satisfying high quality and premium market opportunities. The future well-being of the beef industry will be directly dependent on the returns that farmers can generate from the market. The beef sector can look forward with confidence based on supplying quality products on a competitive basis.In the past three years, the focus of the Irish beef industry has been to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level, shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets and into the higher priced internal EU marketplace. This has coincided with reduced dependence on EU support measures such as intervention and export refunds. EU consumption is predicted to again outstrip production in 2005 with a resulting import gap of an estimated 280,000 tonnes for the year. This will present additional opportunities for Irish beef producers. Beef production is extremely valuable in the Irish economy with a €1.4 billion export value representing almost 25% of total Irish agri-food exports.The new Bord Bia European autumn promotion of identified Irish beef, in conjunction with EU retailers and their Irish suppliers, is under way. This is being rolled out progressively across eight EU countries over the next two months. Initial feedback is already encouraging in terms of improved demand in response to the promotion. It is hoped that we can strengthen the position of Irish beef in the European marketplace. An increased presence in this sophisticated, high value market is the key to the success of the beef industry in the long term.Ireland is competing on the EU markets with beef imported from low cost South American economies notably Brazil. The main concern is that Brazil has a capacity to significantly increase its exports, not only to Ireland but also to our chief export outlets in Europe and in other third countries, in direct competition with us. The issue is one which continues to be monitored and is being considered in the context of our preparations for the WTO talks in Hong Kong in December.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 159 together.I am very concerned about the level of safety on our farms and I support wholeheartedly the work of the Health and Safety Authority which is the State authority charged with overall responsibility for promotion of workplace health and safety. The authority has a proactive inspection and enforcement programme which focuses on high risk sectors, including agriculture, and aims to achieve an improvement in farm safety, and an increase in the percentage of farms with safety statements.My Department is a member of the Farm Safety Partnership Committee which is an advisory committee to the HSA. The committee is made up of key players in the farming sector including the Department of Agriculture and Food, Health and Safety Authority, Teagasc, IFA, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, Farm Relief Network, FBD Insurance, Farm Tractor and Machinery Trade Association and Professional Agricultural Contractors of Ireland. An important element of the HSA programme is the implementation of the farm safety plan 2003-07 which sets targets for the reduction of farm accidents for the period. The plan also provides for on-farm inspections, health and safety training for farmers and promotional campaigns highlighting health and safety issues.Some of the main activities aimed at addressing health and safety problems at farm level are as follows:Farm Safety Action Week.The event is co-ordinated annually by the Health and Safety Authority. My Department is also an active participant. The aim of the week is to promote best safety practice and reduce the number of workplace accidents on Irish farms.Farm Safety Self-Assessment Document.Farmers are obliged to complete a safety statement for their farm. The HSA farm safety self-assessment document is designed so that it can be completed by the farmer. It identifies the key hazards on the farm and the key controls for these hazards.Farm Safety Video.The Farm Safety Partnership Committee is at an advanced stage of finalising a farm safety video which will be made available to all stakeholders.Finally, the farm waste management scheme operated by my Department provides grant aid for investment in facilities that increase on-farm safety. A revised farm waste management scheme with significantly increased grant rates and broadened farmer eligibility is currently with the EU Commission for approval with the plan of introducing the revised scheme from 1 January 2006. Farm building specifications are also continuously under review by my Department and revisions regularly incorporate enhanced safety specifications.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	574	The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.In October 2004, Ireland submitted proposals for a derogation from the general organic nitrogen limit of 170 kg per hectare per annum laid down in the nitrates directive. The proposal was designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. My Department and Teagasc developed the derogation proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The EU Commission was not prepared to engage in formal discussions on the derogation proposals until Ireland's nitrates action programme was agreed. There have recently been preliminary discussions with the Commission, however, and I will be pressing strongly to have these discussions concluded as early as possible in 2006.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	575	While Ireland has a greater percentage of younger farmers less than 35 years of age at 11%, compared to the EU average of 8%, the Government, in recognition of the importance of attracting young farmers into agriculture, has put in place a range of incentives as follows. Regarding installation aid, under the installation aid scheme operated by my Department, a grant of €9,523 is available to young farmers who are between the ages of 18 and 35 on the date of set-up and who meet the educational and income requirements of the scheme. Expenditure to-date under the scheme, since its introduction in 2001, has totalled €22.365 million. Regarding milk quota, seven young trained milk producers with quotas of less than 350,000 litres have priority access to almost 25% of the restructuring pool. They also qualify for the normal allocations open to all producers.Since 2003, young trained farmers have been able to acquire quota from the restructuring scheme and set up their own enterprise on the existing family holding provided they form a registered milk production partnership with their parents. To date, almost 350 new entrant-parent milk production partnerships have been established. As part of the milk quota restructuring scheme for 2005, the conditions applying to new entrant-parent milk production partnerships were amended so that all but the very largest producers now have the opportunity to form such partnerships.Regarding taxation measures, a broad range of taxation incentives is in place to facilitate the transfer of farms to young farmers, especially those with agricultural qualifications. Eligible farmers can avail of 100% stock relief for young trained farmers for four years after set-up, 90% agricultural relief on capital acquisitions tax, 100% stamp duty relief on transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers and full relief from capital gains tax is available for farmers over 55 years of age who transfer the farm to a child or nephew or niece. There is also a rental income tax exemption for farmers over 40 years of age to lease-out land on a long-term basis. Annual relief of €7,500 for leases of five to seven years and €10,000 for leases of more than seven years is available. This encourages land mobility to allow more productive farmers to increase production.In regard to advisory services, Teagasc offers all farmers access to a wide range of independent professional advisory services. Advisory staff are located in a nationwide network of advisory offices and local training centres. All front-line advisory staff are supported by specialists, researchers and laboratory staff from the Teagasc research and development centres. The services are focused on meeting the needs of a diverse farming community and rural society.In regard to education and training, Teagasc provides the full suite of training for young entrants, farmers, rural entrepreneurs and executives-operatives in the food industry. The organisation has a resource of over 200 teachers and trainers operating from nine colleges, local training centres and research centres. More than 10,000 people attend Teagasc training courses each year. All education and training programmes have recently been evaluated, upgraded and benchmarked to the best international standards.

Bord Bia, which has specific responsibility in this regard, carries out regular campaigns at home and abroad. This year these included a promotion of new season lamb on the Irish market which commenced on 16 May and extended to the end of June. Bord Bia also undertook a campaign on the important French market over the summer months, aimed at maintaining and increasing market share for Irish lamb there. This campaign was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, on 11 June 2005. Initiatives such as these play an important role in maintaining and developing markets at home and abroad for Irish lamb, thereby supporting prices paid to suppliers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	577	There has been excellent progress in establishing farmers markets and over 85 farmers' markets are operating in 22 locations throughout the country. These markets encourage local produce, assist start-ups of new businesses and create local employment and their growth reflects changing consumer preferences for fresh locally produced foods. They give producers an opportunity to meet and sell directly to consumers and offer consumers a more enjoyable shopping experience and greater choice.My Department, in co-operation with Bord Bia, the statutory food promotion agency is supporting efforts to promote, strengthen and organise the farmers' market concept. Bord Bia provides advice and mentoring assistance to those wishing to set up farmers' markets. In collaboration with Invest Northern Ireland, Bord Bia has published a comprehensive information guide to the running and operation of these markets and this is available on its website.Following the success of the Food at Farmleigh model, which attracted on average 40 small producers and 6,000 visitors each Sunday from May to October, Bord Bia and the Office of Public Works are examining the feasibility of using selected national heritage sites as possible future venues for farmers' markets. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has invited the comments of local authorities on draft guidelines to enable casual trading to be carried on in a way, which is beneficial to the consumer and consistent with good regulatory practice. In Dublin, Bord Bia is currently co-operating with Dublin City Council with regard to the Smithfield regeneration programme with particular emphasis on the development of the fruit, vegetable and fish markets which will provide valuable access for small producers to the Dublin market.Producers are showing great interest in this area and I welcome the role of the IFA in the recent launch of the Wexford town farmers' market and the Sligo IFA food fair. Leader groups are to be commended for launching the origin farmers' markets initiative, a new cross-Border project to set up farmers' markets in Counties Donegal, Tyrone, Sligo, Leitrim, Antrim and Roscommon and I was delighted to see the opening of a farmers' market in Letterkenny under this initiative. The strategies and activities in place will assist the development of farmers markets in a sustainable way.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I propose to take Questions Nos 163, 189 and 211 together.Promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels, in Ireland are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. As matters stand, Irish Sugar Limited has arrangements in place to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which has been upgraded for that purpose. The question of an alternative use for sugar beet does not, therefore, arise at present.Following the introduction of the single farm payment scheme, the production of crops for energy purposes will, in common with all agricultural production in future, be demand driven. Farmers will only produce crops for bioenergy if the economic returns are greater than those offered by more traditional uses. Nonetheless, factors such as the increasing cost of oil, the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the facility for farmers to explore alternative land uses following CAP reform, mean that the potential of this area must be fully explored.For the purposes of contributing to the development of policy on biofuels, my Department, in conjunction with COFORD and Teagasc, has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. The production of liquid biofuels from energy crops is not economic at current oil price levels. However, the scheme recently announced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for mineral oil tax relief on pilot biofuel projects has stimulated the production of oilseed rape for biofuel.The exploitation of wood resources for energy purposes, mainly for heat or electricity generation, offers significant potential. There are also significant opportunities for using by-products of farming and food processing for bioenergy purposes. Approximately 140,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal is produced annually and its use in place of fossil fuels could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 19%.Teagasc, which has responsibility for the provision of research and advisory services for the agri-food sector, has done some very valuable research on energy crops. I am anxious to encourage further research in this area and I have arranged for research projects on biofuels and other non-food uses of crops to be included in the latest call under my Department's research stimulus programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The 2004 annual report detailed progress in relation to my Department's goal and strategies contained in its fourth statement of strategy, published in 2003, as well as complying with legal requirements to report on the operation of the Land Acts and the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997.The report provides comprehensive information on the activities of my Department in 2004, and some of the main points covered included the arrangements for implementation of the single payment scheme, arising from the decision to opt for full decoupling of direct payments from production. Significant progress was made in what is a major organisational undertaking. The report notes that in addition to commencing the implementation of the SPS, my Department paid over €1.6 billion in direct payments to farmers in 2004, and full details of the payments are included in the report. The report also refers to the substantial progress made during Ireland's EU Presidency in 2004 on the objectives of facilitating the application of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to the new member states, continuing the process of simplification of the CAP initiated by the mid-term review and enhancing food safety standards; the progress on food initiatives in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is set out in the report, with a total of some €187 million having been committed by year-end. Other points of interest in the report included a new milk quota restructuring programme announced in December 2004, with the purpose of making the scheme more effective in securing the long-term future of the dairy industry in an increasingly competitive and market orientated environment. Commenting on some of the main markets, the report notes that export of Irish dairy products and ingredients experienced a 6% rise in 2004 to almost €1.86 billion. The year 2004 also saw a strong performance by Irish beef in European markets, with a 7.4% rise in exports to continental Europe.The report also deals with consumer issues, food safety, animal and plant health, forestry, agri-environment matters, scheme operation and financial management. The report is available from the Government Stationery Office and on my Department's website, www.agriculture.gov.ie.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	580	The Food Agency Co-operation Council has met on 20 occasions since its inception in 2000. The council did not meet in 2004 as a number of factors contributed to the difficulties in rescheduling meetings that year.The council has played a significant role in increasing co-operation between the State agencies involved in the food industry and has led to a number of memorandums of understandings being agreed between agencies. These are currently working well. The council was instrumental in drawing up an agreed human resource development programme for the food processing industry. The council has also produced a number of publications, among them Market Trends — Implications for Suppliers and State Agency Initiatives, a national food incident management plan and a market-led new product development guide, which provides guidance to food and drink companies on new product development best practice and which has been promulgated to county enterprise boards.During 2004, the food development agencies directly concerned with the food programme components of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 met twice with my Department to assess progress on the plan in preparation for meetings of the monitoring committee for the programmes concerned. One such meeting has been held to date in 2005. In the light of the more market orientated CAP framework, the 2015 agri-vision report and the enterprise strategy report, my Department is considering the manner in which the various food agencies can most effectively co-operate to develop the agri-food industry. The role and format of the Food Agency Co-Operation Council is being examined in this context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	581	Since January 2005, under the Department's active surveillance programme, some 17,900 sheep were rapid tested for scrapie at meat factories and knackeries. This programme, together with the reporting of suspect animals, led to the identification of 18 new flocks with the disease.For sheep which are depopulated, compensation payable includes live valuation of the breeding animals and payment for factory lambs in accordance with the average factory price per kilogram pertaining to the week of slaughter. A grant of €28 per breeding ewe is also payable. In addition, the Department genotypes the entire flock and a limited number of replacement rams free of charge.In May 2004, the Department commenced a national genotype programme. The overall objective of this voluntary scheme is to identify sheep in the national flock, particularly breeding stock, by genotype and to raise the level of resistance to scrapie by promoting the use of scrapie resistant animals for breeding. The Department recently announced enhancements to this national genotype programme, including a once-off payment of €40 towards the costs of veterinary fees, in respect of every flock which is genotyped between 1 September and 18 November 2005. In addition, the Department will also pay a flat-rate compensation in respect of any ram which, when tested during the above period, is found to be in one of the categories which are susceptible or highly susceptible to scrapie.The amount of compensation payable to any one claimant will be capped at €1,500. In order to avail of this compensation, susceptible animals must be presented for slaughtered on or before 30 November 2005.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland's national action programme under the nitrates directive was formally submitted to the European Commission by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 29 July 2005. The next step is for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make regulations to give legal effect to the action programme. My Department, supported by Teagasc, has been assisting the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in finalising these regulations. I expect the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish the draft regulations very shortly for public consultation.The final stage of the process, but an extremely important one, is for Ireland to secure a derogation from the general organic nitrogen limits in the directive so that farmers can operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. My Department and Teagasc developed the derogation proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There have been preliminary discussions with the Commission about the derogation application and I will be pressing strongly to have these discussions concluded as early as possible in 2006.To help farmers meet their obligations under the action programme, I am seeking approval from the European Commission for very significant improvements in the farm waste management scheme. These include increasing the grant rate from 40% to 60%, and to 70% in the counties in zone C; a top-up of 5% to 10% for young farmers; higher investment ceilings and the extension of the scheme to the pig and poultry sectors.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Ireland fully supports the commitment made by the European Union at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, to form an EU action plan for forest law enforcement, governance and trade, FLEGT, in order to combat the importation of illegally felled timber into the European Union. Illegal logging is a major contributor to environmental damage in developing countries and is closely associated with corruption and the cycle of bribery which is detrimental to economic growth in the developing world. It is estimated by the World Bank that illegal logging costs the governments of developing countries up to €15 billion each year in lost revenue. The FLEGT regulation will introduce a licensing scheme built around voluntary partnership agreements between the EU and wood producing countries. The partnership agreements will be applicable in all EU member states. My Department has been involved in interdepartmental consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Customs on the matter.Ireland has been a supporter of the FLEGT proposal since the outset. I can report that the thrust of the regulation has been generally agreed at working group level in Brussels. I look forward to further discussions on the subject at the Agriculture Council of Ministers at the end of October.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I have made it clear that the Commission's proposals for reform of the EU sugar regime, which were published on 22 June, are unacceptable in their present form. The key elements of the proposals are a 39% price cut in the institutional price for sugar, a corresponding reduction in the minimum price for sugar beet and 60% compensation to farmers for the price cut. A voluntary restructuring scheme is proposed to encourage factory closures and the renunciation of quota. While the need for reform of the EU sugar regime is acknowledged, I consider that the Commission's proposals are unbalanced, go beyond the principles of previous CAP reforms and could lead to drastic consequences for the sugar beet industry in a number of member states, including Ireland. This is an unprecedented situation in terms of CAP reform proposals presented by the Commission for any sector.I expressed my serious concerns about the proposals when I met with Commissioner Fischer Boel on her visit to Ireland in June, and again at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July. I emphasised that the price cuts proposed are too severe, the reforms should be based on a longer lead in time for the Everything But Arms agreement and it would be preferable to await the outcome of the WTO meeting in Hong Kong in December before seeking to conclude an agreement on sugar reform. I have also continued to remain in contact with like-minded colleague Ministers from other member states who are opposed to the reform proposals. My overall objective is to ensure a more balanced agreement, which will take Irish interests into account. The proposals will be considered again by the Council of Ministers on 24-25 October and, given their severity, it is clear that the negotiations will continue to be difficult.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Ltd. which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. Irish Sugar Ltd. places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specific tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota. Ownership of the sugar quota had never been an issue in the past because the relevant EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quotas. Speculations about quota ownership only arose when the Commission, in July 2004, raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility, in the context of its initial thinking on reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, voiced strong opposition to the idea of cross-border mobility and I am pleased to say that it does not form part of the Commission's legislative reform proposals which were published in June. In any event, the EU Commission has confirmed that the quota is not an asset owned by the member state or other party but is simply a mechanism for regulating the market.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	586	Progress has been reasonably satisfactory this year to date and I expect planting levels to be about the same as last year, in the region of 11,000 hectares. I would like more to have been planted but I accept that farmers have had to consider their options with the introduction of the new single payment regime, the nitrates situation and the revised REP scheme. I hope that, as the new changed situation beds down, farmers will begin to examine in greater detail the contribution forestry can make to their long-term farm income. Farmers can plant up to 50% of their land without affecting their single payment and draw down forestry premiums of up to €500 per hectare a year for 20 years. I urge farmers to avail of this package and I remind them that if they are thinking about planting next year, they need to begin planning properly now.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	587	The Scientific Study on Children's Diet was co-funded by my Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and was the first study to benchmark dietary intakes of a nationally representative sample of Irish children. The work was carried out by researchers in Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork who surveyed 600 children aged between five and 12 years from primary schools throughout Ireland during 2003 and 2004 and collected information on diet, physical activity and body measurements on each child as well as lifestyle information for both the children and their parents.With regard to diet, the study identified that intake of fruit and vegetables was low and on average well below international recommendations. Fat and salt intakes were higher than recommended and food eaten outside the home accounted for less than 10% of total calorie consumption. Overweight and obesity in five to 12 year old schoolchildren is relatively high and increasing. I consider it important that the data collected in the study should be further analysed and cross-referenced with other available information to assist in evidence-based policy formulation and implementation and to provide the public and the food industry with useful information. Discussions on how this might best be done have taken place with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the FIRM funding committee under the aegis of my Department and I expect to have more detailed proposals later this year.The findings of the Scientific Study on Children's Diet will assist the food industry to tailor product development and promotion to lifestyle patterns and trends based on the scientific data gathered. They will also be of valuable assistance in formulating new products to meet emerging nutritional demands. In addition, a Bord Bia programme to promote consumption of fruit and vegetables in up to 150 primary schools over the next three years will be launched this week.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	588	The incidence of brucellosis has fallen very significantly since 1998 with the number of laboratory positives falling from 6,417 in 1998 to 664 in 2004. This represents a 90% reduction in disease levels in that period. The total number of animals slaughtered per annum under the eradication programme fell from 29,778 to 6,195 during the same period. Further progress has been made this year. Up to the end of August this year, there were only 206 blood positives compared with 514 in the same period last year. There were only 123 new herd restrictions compared with 202 in the same period in 2004; 24 herds were depopulated in 2005 compared with 57 in the same period in 2004. Some 1,346 animals were removed as brucellosis reactors-incontacts compared with 5,078 in the same period in 2004. The substantial improvement in disease incidence is due to a number of factors, including continued co-operation from all parties with the eradication regime, the tightening up on illegal cattle movements through the cattle movement monitoring system, the regulation of dealers, prosecutions for breaches and the imposition of penalties for failures to comply with animal disease and identification regulations. I am confident this progress can be maintained into the future with the continued operation of the existing measures and the ongoing co-operation of farmers and all involved in the livestock industry. It is, however, vital that we continue to recognise that brucellosis is a highly contagious disease and that we do not relax or relent in our efforts to eradicate it from our national herd. In view of this, we need to continue in the medium term with the existing comprehensive control and eradication measures, which have brought about positive results in recent years in terms of reduced incidence of the disease.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	589	The number of sheep exported live from Ireland in recent years has increased from approximately 35,000 head in 2003 to 58,000 head in 2004, with a figure of 65,000 head having been exported to date in 2005. This compares to a total of 3.25 million sheep slaughtered at approved export plants in 2004. The export trade in live sheep consists in the main of animals destined for slaughter in plants in Northern Ireland. All other exports are subject to the application of residency and standstill certification requirements on the movement of animals from farm to farm. My Department is seeking to improve these provisions, which are required under EU legislation, and has written to the EU Commission seeking an amendment that should meet the concerns of farmers and exporters. The Department is awaiting a response from the Commission.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	590	As the Deputy may be aware, an interdepartmental-interagency working group was established within my Department in October 2003 to develop proposals for a national strategy and best practices to ensure the co-existence of GM crops with conventional and organic farming. I have just recently received the report of the group and I am in the process of examining it. While part of the group's work programme included an appraisal of economic implications of co-existence I believe that the wider economic issues should also be examined. Accordingly, I have asked Teagasc to explore the possibility of carrying out an evaluation of the possible implications for the agri-food industry from the possible use of GMOs in crop and livestock production. This evaluation is near finalisation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	591	Beef production is extremely valuable to the economy with a €1.4 billion export value representing almost 25% of total Irish agri-food exports. Most of our beef exports to date, this year, have been to the high value UK and EU markets. EU consumption is predicted to again outstrip production in 2005 with a resulting import gap of an estimated 280,000 tonnes for the year. This will provide opportunities for our beef exports in the high value continental EU markets.Our aim is to consolidate out position in the EU market and in this regard, Bord Bia recently launched its Irish Beef in Europe campaign which is aimed at building sales of Irish beef in European supermarkets, and to establish the Irish Beef brand firmly in the minds of consumers. This is being rolled out progressively across eight EU countries over the next two months. In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in our market penetration in the high value EU marketplace. In 2001, we exported 72,000 tonnes to continental EU with only two retailers stocking Irish beef. By last year those exports had more than doubled to 174,000 tonnes and more than 30 retail groups, in that valuable market, are stocking Irish beef. The marketing effort will be continued in order to build further sustainable market share in Europe.The ending of the over 30 months scheme in the UK has been announced and is expected to result in displacement of 70,000 tonnes on the UK market. We will have to intensify our marketing effort to retain outlets for our beef within the EU and in other third country markets. It is estimated that total beef exports in 2005 will be slightly reduced on the 2004 figure of 497,000 tonnes.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I welcome the positive outcome of the agreement on the forestry element of the new Rural Development Regulation 2007-2013. Following intensive negotiations, which concluded on 20 June 2005, Ireland secured a most satisfactory outcome, in spite of a bleak starting position. The original draft regulation proposed a maximum 40% establishment grant for new afforestation projects as opposed to the existing 100%; a reduced premium ceiling of €500, currently standing at €725; and a reduced premium period from 20 years to ten years. Ireland consistently opposed the negative aspects of many of the proposals for forestry and in the concluding agreement achieved the following: an establishment grant of 80% in less favoured areas, covering 74% of the country, and 70% elsewhere; premium rate ceiling re-established at €700; premium period set at 15 years; and opportunities for State aid top-up. I regard this outcome as extremely positive for Ireland and I am satisfied that the response provides a careful support system on which to further develop the sector.

Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants by 1 December next. This will allow allocations to be reflected in the single payment scheme payment which is scheduled to commence on 1 December 2005. The single payment advisory committee comprising representatives of my Department, Teagasc and the farming organisations met recently to discuss the rules for allocating the national reserve. Further contacts will take place on this matter before a final decision is made.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I welcome the publication of the report of the national task force on obesity and I acknowledge the need for a long-term sustained commitment from relevant Departments, agencies and food industry stakeholders to tackle the obesity crisis. My Department is fully committed to engaging in this process and it made a comprehensive submission to the task force setting out the Department's role and responsibilities in the areas of food safety and quality and funding public good research in the food sector. Officials from my Department have met the Department of Health and Children to discuss the report in general terms and to consider the specific recommendations directed at my Department, namely, "the Department of Agriculture and Food should review policies in partnership with other government departments to promote access to healthy food. Such policies should encompass positive discrimination in the provision of grants and funding to local industry in favour of healthy products" and "the Department of Agriculture and Food together with the Department of Health and Children should promote the implementation of evidence-based healthy eating interventions". As I indicated in previous replies, positive discrimination in the provision of grants and funding to local industry in favour of healthy products envisages a form of subsidisation that is not permissible under EU state aid rules and could be challenged on competition grounds.As regards the second recommendation, Bord Bia, the statutory food promotion agency, through my Department secured approval from the European Commission in June to fund a programme to promote consumption of fruit and vegetables in up to 150 primary schools over the next three years. The programme is based on a concept known as "Food Dude" and was developed by researchers at the Bangor food research unit at the University of Wales. It is designed to encourage schoolchildren to develop a liking for fruit and vegetables by means of customised rewards for eating fruit and vegetables, role model encouragement and the active participation of parents and teachers. The budget of €1.2 million is being co-funded by the European Commission, €600,000, my Department, €240,000, and €360,000 from Wholesale Produce Ireland Ltd., a representative body for the fresh produce industry in Ireland. Bord Bia will manage the programme and recently concluded a contract with my Department to implement the measures. The programme will be launched this week. My Department is examining the possibilities for further initiatives in partnership with the Department of Health and Children.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	595	My Department has maintained a vigilant approach to the risk of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry following confirmation of the existence of a high pathogenic strain in Russia and Kazakhstan in August. In particular it has been active in reviewing all aspects of our contingency arrangements and several measures have been introduced to improve our preparedness to deal with any suspect or confirmed outbreak. Given the critical importance of early detection, my Department has, with the assistance of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and Birdwatch Ireland, introduced an "early warning system" where increased or unusual patterns of wild bird mortality are observed. This "early warning system" is just part of a more intensified approach which we are taking to surveillance, including surveillance of wild birds and poultry. The 2005-06 poultry surveillance programme is under way and my Department has made arrangements for increasing levels of wild bird surveillance at a number of locations throughout the country. In addition, officials from my Department have recently met their colleagues from the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and have agreed to continue to work together and to exchange the results of their respective wild bird surveillance programmes. The two Departments will review progress at a scheduled meeting this month.The EU Commission recently extended, until September 2006, safeguard measures that have been in place since 23 January 2004. Furthermore, these measures, which originally applied only to affected countries in south east Asia, have been extended to Russia and Kazakhstan. These measures include a ban on live poultry, birds other than poultry and poultry products, other than heat treated poultry meat and treated feathers. Poultry meat, which is properly cooked, does not present a risk of infection as the virus is destroyed at temperatures at or above 70° Celsius. My Department has increased its checks on commercial products and products in personal luggage from all affected countries. There is no evidence to indicate that untreated poultry meat is being imported illegally. In addition, my Department is reviewing the information it makes available to flockowners regarding biosecurity and clinical signs of the disease, as well as travellers, particularly to those countries which are infected.While we are taking all reasonable steps to avoid an outbreak of avian influenza, we cannot, particularly because of the potential threat posed by migrating wild birds, dismiss the possibility of an outbreak. Our resources are, therefore, primarily focused on ensuring early detection and speedy eradication and minimising risk to public health. The measures in place are designed to ensure a suspected outbreak is investigated quickly and the existence of the virus confirmed or otherwise. My Department has ensured the appropriate technical and veterinary staff are properly equipped to deal with a suspected-confirmed outbreak and we have examined all aspects associated with the destruction of inflected flocks and the subsequent disposal of the carcasses. I fully acknowledge the risks associated with an outbreak of avian influenza and accept that there is no room for complacency. Notwithstanding the low probability of an outbreak of the high pathogenic strain that might pose a risk to human health, my Department is maintaining a vigilant approach to the threat posed and constantly reviewing the adequacy of our contingency arrangements in the light of any new information that emerges.Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are concerns that a mutation or a genetic change in the virus circulating in Asia could lead to it transforming into a new strain of influenza capable of human to human transmission. Responsibility for preparing for such an eventuality rests with the Department of Health and Children and its agencies. My Department is an active participant in that Department's influenza pandemic expert group and is contributing to updating its influenza pandemic plan.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	596	To assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates action programme, I have announced details of a proposed revised farm waste management scheme for which EU approval is now being sought. I hope early approval of the scheme will be forthcoming so that it can be introduced next January.Subject to the required EU approval, the scheme will introduce a standard grant rate of 60%, with 70% being available for zone C counties, in place of the current grant rate of 40%, with additional aid available for young farmers at rates of 10% in less-favoured areas and 5% in other areas; it will extend the maximum income unit ceiling for farmers from 450 to 650 income units, with no upper limit being applied in the case of pig and poultry farmers; raise the maximum eligible investment from €75,000 to €120,000; remove any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers can participate in the scheme; the scheme will be extended to include horses, deer, goats, pigs, poultry, and mushroom compost; and introduce a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to maximum eligible investment of €80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs and €40,000 in the case of specialised slurry spreading tankers and related equipment. The scheme will increase the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from €11,000 to €15,000 with the grant rate remaining at 20%.I am satisfied that, if approved, the revised scheme will provide a very satisfactory platform for Irish farmers who need to carry out additional investment works to meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. I urge farmers to make the necessary arrangements to ensure they are ready to avail of the scheme by the proposed implementation date.Implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland's national action programme under the nitrates directive was formally submitted to the European Commission by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 29 July 2005. The next step is for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make regulations to give legal effect to the action programme. My Department, supported by Teagasc, has been assisting the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in finalising these regulations. I expect the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish the draft regulations very shortly for public consultation.The final stage of the process, but an extremely important one, is for Ireland to secure a derogation from the general organic nitrogen limits in the directive so that farmers can operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kilogrammes of organic nitrogen per hectare. My Department and Teagasc developed the derogation proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There have been preliminary discussions with the Commission about the derogation application and I will press strongly to have these discussions concluded as early as possible in 2006.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 209 together.The dairy industry continues to contribute very substantially to the national economy, with an output value of some €2.3 billion and exports of €1.86 billion last year. This year exports are again performing very well despite adjustments to market management supports brought about by the implementation of the Luxembourg Agreement on the reform of the CAP.The Commission market management policy has been far too aggressive and I have consistently and resolutely challenged the Commissioner at every opportunity, including raising the matter at the Council of Ministers. As a consequence of enlisting the support of many other member states for my point of view I believe the Commission policy has moderated in recent times, now having closer regard to the market implications of its actions rather than its previous emphasis on budgetary policy.While acknowledging that some adjustment in market management measures is warranted, indeed necessary, if the Luxembourg Agreement is to be implemented in full, my concern has been to ensure that the transition is implemented in a more measured way. Sustained downward pressure on market supports would effectively reduce our international competitiveness and put pressure on our ability to fully exploit opportunities to export milk products to international markets. A longer period in which to make the necessary adjustment will instead provide a more solid platform on which to build new market opportunities while consolidating our position in existing markets.Mindful of the role exchange rates play in international price competitiveness I have asked the Commission to be particularly sensitive about how it implements market adjustments in reaction to currency fluctuations that may be susceptible to exceptional circumstances rather than reflecting otherwise normally stable economic indicators. The stability prevailing in producer prices over recent times is welcome and the direct payments, amounting to €120 million this year, rising to €180 million next year, as compensation for the reduction in institutional support prices should result in a higher return for dairy farmers this year and into the future. I will continue to exert every possible pressure on the EU Commission to ensure that in its management of the EU dairy regime, we achieve a satisfactory outcome for the Irish dairy industry in terms of enhanced industry competitiveness and stable farm incomes into the future.

The CSO data shows that the price of gas oil increased by 30.2% in the 12 months from August 2004 to August 2005. The CSO agricultural price index indicates that the cost of motor fuels in agricultural inputs increased by approximately 15% over the 12 months to July 2005.The CSO output, input and income in agriculture release also shows that the category fuel and lubricants accounts for approximately 7% of intermediate consumption which, although significant, means these increases have had a relatively limited direct impact on the overall cost of agricultural inputs.The cost of fuel and energy products is driven by international oil prices. This is an issue for all parts of the economy including the agricultural sector. Rising input costs, and fluctuations in international oil prices, underline the importance of ensuring that all inputs are used efficiently.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	599	Traceability and labelling of Irish farm produce is an area accorded priority by my Department. Sophisticated traceability systems for cattle, sheep and pigs have been developed and implemented in recent years. In addition the labelling of foodstuffs was examined by a food labelling group and the main recommendations of that group have been implemented, in particular the centralisation of enforcement of food labelling legislation through the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.In respect of beef, we already have in place a full identification, traceability and labelling system under comprehensive EU regulations. The labelling requirements under those regulations extend up to and including retail level and to the point of delivery into hotels, restaurants and catering establishments.My next priority in this area is to extend the existing beef labelling laws to require information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to all consumers in the restaurant and catering sectors. I put specific proposals to Government at the end of June for a legislative framework to facilitate this, by way of an amendment to the 1947 Health Act. This will be introduced under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 which is before the Oireachtas this session. The appropriate regulations are being worked on concurrently and it is my intention to have these cleared at EU level as soon as possible. When the Act is amended and the regulations made, country of origin information will be available to consumers in respect of all beef served in restaurants, hotels and the whole catering sector in Ireland on a mandatory basis.In the meantime the various representative bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and both of the vintners groups following discussions with my Department, have all agreed to recommend to their members the introduction on a voluntary basis of a mechanism for providing consumers in their premises, with information on the country of origin of the beef served there, in advance of the mandatory legal requirement. This agreement was finalised last week and these organisations are currently at various stages in that process. I expect the voluntary system will be in place in the very near future.The beef sector has the most developed system of labelling within the EU legislative framework. The next step in meat labelling is to extend the labelling requirements in law for poultry meat, pig meat and sheep meat in order to have similar provisions as those for beef. This is not a straightforward matter and would involve considerable complexities. EU approval would be required and there is no precedent so far for individual member states being allowed to extend meat labelling requirements internally, beyond providing information which is already required in EU laws.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	601	Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority, was established under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988. Its function under the Act is to provide research, training and advisory services for the agri-food sector. Teagasc is governed by an 11 member authority. The chairman and five ordinary members are appointed by the Minister and the remaining five members are appointed by the Minister following nominations from designated organisations, namely, the IFA, the ICMSA, ICOS, Macra na Feirme and Teagasc unions.Teagasc has 1,300 permanent staff, comprising advisers, teachers and research scientists with appropriate supporting services. These are complemented by some 250 contract staff, as well as teaching staff in the private agricultural and horticultural colleges. Teagasc staff carry out their functions from more than 90 locations.Teagasc's operating budget for 2005 amounts to more than €155 million. Advisory services make up the biggest budget item, 35% of expenditure, followed by production research, 32%, training programmes, 19%, and food research, 13%. My Department's provision to Teagasc for capital and non-capital purposes in 2005 amounts to €123 million. The amount for non-capital purposes is €118.5 million and for capital development purposes the allocation is €4.5 million. By any standards these are substantial resources and are a clear indication of the Government's continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc activities.It is the responsibility of the Teagasc authority to prioritise activities and to allocate its funding accordingly. This it has done over the years in accordance with the needs of clients, EU and Government policy and industry needs. I am satisfied that in doing so it has provided a first-class service to Irish farmers.In the short term Teagasc will have to reconfigure its programmes in response to the fundamental changes in agriculture arising out of the single payment. The authority is already well accustomed to tailoring its programmes to meet the changing requirements of the agri-food sector. Its annual programme of activities is developed in consultation with the key stakeholders in the sector many of whom are represented on the authority. Recently it has undertaken more strategic planning initiatives, the Teagasc 2000 review and the three year strategy required under the strategic management initiative. A new review of its training and education programmes has recently been completed.I am satisfied that Teagasc is well placed to face the future and to continue to provide the innovation and technology transfer for the sustainable development of agriculture, the food industry and rural communities in the years ahead.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I am strongly committed to the development of the organic sector in Ireland. My Department already provides incentives to encourage organic farming, which are substantial in proportion to the size of the sector. Through the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, almost €4 million was paid directly to organic farmers in 2004. Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered some €31 million to the sector. Under the current scheme, an organic farmer with 55 hectares is eligible for an annual payment of €18,505 a year for the first two years while the farm is in conversion, and €13,555 each year for the rest of his or her time in the scheme.Many of the changes recommended in the organic development committee report were incorporated in the new REPS 3 scheme launched last year. To facilitate and encourage the expansion of the sector, partial conversion of a holding is now permitted. The increase in the eligible area for payment has benefited all farmers. The scheme conditions have been amended to facilitate a farmer to receive the in-conversion financial support for the equivalent of his or her full conversion period. Farmers with commonage lands or grazing rights can now participate, under strict criteria, in the organic supplementary measure of the scheme.Special investment aid is also available for organic farmers and processors under the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which supports investment both on-farm and off-farm. For on-farm investments, grant aid can be given for 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of more than €50,000. For off-farm investments, the maximum grant is more than €500,000.In addition, my Department has implemented all the main recommendations of the organic development committee's report published in April 2002. The demonstration farm project, for example, has been a considerable success and additional farms have been included this year.The decoupling of farm payments establishes a new policy framework in which farmers will have the freedom to farm in response to market demands. In this more market-oriented scenario, there is real scope for organic production to expand with the help of the financial incentives that I have outlined already.

In October 2004, Ireland submitted proposals for a derogation from the general organic nitrogen limit of 170 kilogrammes per hectare per annum laid down in the nitrates directive. The proposal was designed to allow farmers to operate under appropriate conditions and controls up to a level of 250 kilogrammes of organic nitrogen per hectare. My Department and Teagasc developed the derogation proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The European Commission was not prepared to engage in formal discussions on the derogation proposals until Ireland's nitrates action programme was agreed. There have been preliminary discussions with the Commission, however, and I will press strongly to have these discussions concluded as early as possible in 2006.

I am sure this information will feed into any future amendments that will be made by the EU in respect of the approval of oilseed rape for cultivation within the EU.As the Deputy is aware EU legislation governing the growing and distribution of GM products within the EU has been jointly adopted by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, after many years of negotiations and discussions. The provisions of this legislation are binding on all member states. The only area where subsidiarity is permitted within this legislative framework is in regard to co-existence between GM crops and non-GM crops. Member states have been asked to draw up their own rules in how this can be implemented and I have just recently received a report and recommendations from the interdepartmental interagency working group which was established to draw up such rules for this country.

A superintending veterinary inspector based in my Department's Tallaght office has responsibility for the operation of the Wicklow veterinary office. There are two veterinary inspectors covering the east Wicklow area, one of whom is based in the Wicklow office. There are three agricultural technical staff and one full-time and one part-time clerical staff engaged on veterinary work in the office.While files for east Wicklow are held in the Tallaght office, the Wicklow office is linked electronically into the Department's disease eradication network including the cattle movement and monitoring system, CMMS, and the animal health computer system, AHCS.The services provided by the Wicklow office include the issue of movement permits, CMMS clearance for abattoirs and provision of information on disease control. The Wicklow office also provides agricultural environmental and single payment scheme services to farmers and six staff are engaged on this work.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	606	The agreement on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 reached at the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 26 June 2003 was a balanced one, which addressed Ireland's principal objectives. Among these objectives were the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that will allow farmers and the agri-sector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands and international circumstances. The financial envelope provided for each member state represented the average value of livestock and arable aid premia paid in the member state during the three year reference period 2000-2002 calculated at 2002 rates of payment. I am particularly pleased that the 2002 rate of payment was used to calculate the single payment as this was the highest rate payable under the Agenda 2000 agreement.The result of the negotiations represented a very satisfactory outcome for Ireland with the achievement of significant improvements on the original proposals. In particular the proposed automatic degression of direct payments by a level of up to 13% was withdrawn. The removal of this particular provision meant a saving of some €420 million for Ireland over the lifetime of the agreement. The compromises agreed was to allow the Council to review, from 2007 onwards, the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise.Under the agreement, member states were allowed to implement the single payment scheme using the so-called historic model or a variation of that model. Following widespread consultation with farmers and other interested parties, Ireland opted to implement full decoupling with effect from 2005 using the historic model. This means that the single payment scheme is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid livestock premia and-or arable aid in one or more of those years and who will continue to engage in an agricultural activity in 2005. The gross single payment entitlement for each farmer represents the average number of animals and-or the average number of hectares, in the case of arable aid, on which payments were made in the three reference years.The overall agreement also allows for a review of the single payment scheme to take place in 2009.

Earlier this month I provided a detailed response to the report. Regrettably, there are a number of the committee's recommendations I have not been able to accept. They are precluded by elements of the EU regulations under which the current scheme and its predecessor are operated. When the same issues were raised by retired farmers with the European Commission, the Commission concluded that my Department was operating the scheme correctly. However, the committee made other recommendations which I am still considering.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	608	The agreement on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, reached at the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 26 June 2003, provided a financial envelope to each member state. This envelope represented the average value of livestock and arable aid premia paid in the member state during the three-year reference period 2000-02 calculated at 2002 rates of payment. The outcome, which will reshape the Common Agricultural Policy and secure its future in making it more relevant to modern society, was a balanced one which addressed Ireland's principal objectives. Among these objectives was the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that will allow farmers and the agri-sector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands and international circumstances.Index linking of the single payment scheme was not an element of the Commission's proposals which included a proposal to provide for a reduction of up to 13% in the single payment, known as degression, to meet future financing needs. One of the major achievements in the negotiations was the removal of this proposal, as it meant a saving of approximately €420 million for Ireland over the lifetime of the agreement. The compromise agreed was to allow the Council to review, from 2007 onwards, the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise.In so far as making payment in two instalments is concerned Council Regulation 1782/2003, governing the single payment scheme, provides that payments shall be made once a year within the period from 1 December of the scheme year to 30 June of the following calendar year. The regulation also provides that the European Commission may authorise making advance payments in certain circumstances.My Department is committed to commencing full payments on 1 December next, the earliest date possible under the regulation. The target date of 1 December for commencement of full payments is particularly tight taking account of the fact that this is the first year of the new scheme involving a complete new system and more than 154,000 applications must be processed. Therefore, we will not make advance payments this year. However, in the context of the new charter of rights for farmers, I am committed to requesting the European Commission to provide for advance payment on an ongoing basis with effect from 2006. It should be noted however that if the European Commission were to agree to the making of advance payments, for budgetary reasons it is unlikely that any such payments could be made before 16 October each year.

The indications are that an annual growth rate of approximately 10% should be achievable in the Irish organic food market in the medium term. I am strongly committed to the organic sector and my Department provides a number of incentives to encourage this development, including the rural environmental protection scheme, a grant aid scheme supporting investment by farmers and processors and a demonstration farm project.

In October 2004, Ireland submitted proposals for a derogation from the general organic nitrogen limit of 170 kg per hectare per annum laid down in the nitrates directive. The proposal was designed to allow farmers to operate under appropriate conditions and controls up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. My Department and Teagasc developed the derogation proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The European Commission was not prepared to engage in formal discussions on the derogation proposals until Ireland's nitrates action programme was agreed. However, preliminary discussions with the Commission have taken place, and I will press strongly to have these discussions concluded as early as possible in 2006.To help farmers meet their obligations under the action programme, I will seek approval from the European Commission for significant improvements in the farm waste management scheme. These include increasing the grant rate from 40% to 60%, and to 70% in the counties in zone C; a top-up of 5% to 10% for young farmers; higher investment ceilings and the extension of the scheme to the pig and poultry sectors.

Approximately 16,000 people are directly employed in 180 companies in the sector, which now accounts for 12% of food exports.The food development agencies work closely with companies to assist them to develop, commercialise and market products that satisfy consumer demand and preferences. The key drivers of demand in the sector are changes in consumer eating habits; health focus; snacking products; cook times; food service and new eating occasions such as in-car dining.The sector also faces challenges, principally retail consolidation, a very competitive and cost-focused international market and issues of scale. The food related measures in the national development plan are focused on enhancing the competitiveness and innovative capability of the industry and exploiting market opportunities. My Department is committed to supporting the food development agencies and the industry to achieve continued growth in value-added products and exports.

In 2001, we exported 72,000 tonnes to the continental EU and only two retailers stocked Irish beef. By last year, exports had more than doubled to 174,000 tonnes and over 30 retail groups in that valuable market stock Irish beef. The beef industry is worth €1.4 billion in foreign earnings to the Irish economy annually.Following considerable work with regard to the Egyptian market, significant progress was made with the signing in August of a new protocol on veterinary and animal heath conditions to apply to our beef exports to Egypt. The protocol considerably eases the restrictions on trade which previously existed and a revised veterinary certificate which reflects this has been agreed. I anticipate that these developments, which effectively reduce the costs associated with beef exports to that destination, allied to the special attractive export refund for Egypt, should enhance trade prospects this autumn.The usual seasonal drop in beef prices has occurred this autumn, although earlier and greater than in previous years. However, because of the higher prices paid in the earlier part of the year, the average price since the start of 2005 to date is 4% above that paid during the same period in 2004. It is estimated that overall, average cattle prices for 2005 will be 3% up on last year.

While the final net impact cannot be stated exactly at this stage, it is estimated that my Department will be able to operate with approximately 400 less staff than authorised numbers.The redeployment of staff is actively managed within my Department to ensure that the service levels for our clients in existing schemes are maintained and that the preparations for the introduction of the single payment scheme are progressed satisfactorily. To this end many staff freed from the livestock and premium schemes have been transferred, on a temporary basis, to work on the new single payment scheme.My Department has also been in contact with other Departments that have networks of existing local offices, in particular the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Courts Service and Land Registry, with regard to the transfer of staff to other Departments. A total of 28 staff comprising one principal officer, one assistant principal, six higher executive officers, five executive officers, two staff officers and 13 clerical officers from local offices and Castlebar have already been redeployed to other Departments.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The designation of land under EU birds and habitats directives is a function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question of compensation for farmers in the Shannon Callows area is a matter, in the first instance, for that Department, and I understand discussions with the farming bodies have been taking place for some time and were continuing up to recent days.As far as REPS is concerned, arrangements specifically designed to address the situation of farmers in the Shannon Callows are already in place. Farmers in this area who wish to join REPS, but believe the REPS payments do not fully offset any income loss arising from the restrictions placed on their farming activities because of designation under the birds and habitats directives, may now also apply to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for additional compensation. Before this arrangement was introduced in September 2004, such farmers had to choose between REPS and the compensation arrangements operated by NPWS but could not benefit from both.This further concession was additional to the inclusion of a new supplementary measure in REPS when REPS 3 was introduced in June 2004. Designated areas were already eligible for payments under REPS measure A of €242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares and lesser amounts for areas over 40 hectares, and the new supplementary measure provides for an additional payment of €100 per hectare on particular sites in the Callows which are important corncrake habitats. Those sites are monitored by BirdWatch Ireland, and REPS farmers can qualify for the additional payment by subscribing to BirdWatch Ireland management prescriptions for them.REPS is a highly successful agri-environment measure and is acknowledged as such by the European Commission. One of the features of REPS commended by the Commission is the fact that the whole farm is subjected to the full range of basic undertakings. This model has served Irish farmers well since the introduction of REPS in 1994 and it is not my intention to depart from the whole farm approach to accommodate a situation which I believe has already been addressed adequately.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	618	An important part of the reform of the CAP leading to the introduction of the single payment scheme is the creation of an effective link between EU support for agriculture and measures aimed at protecting the environment and improving the countryside as well as achieving high standards in food safety and in animal health and welfare. Farmers receiving direct aid under the single payment scheme are required to observe various statutory management requirements on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health. They must also maintain their land in good agricultural and environmental condition. This is known as cross-compliance.In general the rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the relevant statutory management requirement, SMR, or good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, apply. However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the animal identification and registration requirements, as this level is prescribed under the relevant regulations. This applies to bovines only as sheep are being discussed.In addition to cross-compliance checks, it is a requirement to carry out standard eligibility checks to verify that the actual area claimed in the single payment application form corresponds with the area held by the farmer and to ensure there are no overlapping or duplicate claims.My Department, as the EU accredited paying agency, will have primary responsibility to ensure that the required level of cross-compliance inspections is carried out and for fixing any sanctions to be applied. At the same time the competent control authorities are responsible for ensuring compliance with the standards and requirements defined under the SMRs and good agricultural and environmental conditions. The competent control authority responsible for compliance with identification and registration of cattle is the national beef assurance division of my Department while the body responsible for ensuring compliance with the habitats directive is the National Parks and Wildlife Service section of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities have responsibility for compliance with the requirements defined in the sewage sludge, and protection of groundwater directives.In implementing the single payment scheme, the policy of my Department is to minimise the number of inspection visits and to move towards a situation where, in most cases, all eligibility and cross-compliance checks will be carried out during a single farm visit. My Department has consulted all competent control authorities to ensure the maximum level of integration of inspections across all areas. This approach should minimise the level of inconvenience to farmers. However, in certain instances it may not be possible to avoid more than one inspection of the same holding. On this basis it is estimated that, in all, fewer than 10,000 inspections will be carried out annually under the single payment scheme. This represents a reduction of approximately 50% in the number of inspections carried out annually under the old coupled direct payments schemes.My Department has engaged in detailed discussions with farming organisations in the context of a new charter of rights for farmers. The charter will set out the criteria under which on-farm inspections will be carried out with a view to ensuring that the arrangements are fair and equitable and that minor non-compliance will not give rise to any financial sanction.The European Commission has conducted a preliminary audit of our system and has signalled in preliminary findings that the tolerance levels proposed are likely to result in the application of sanctions at the lower end of the acceptable scale. My Department is awaiting the Commission's final report and confirmation that it regards the framework for the application of cross-compliance checks in Ireland as fully meeting the requirements. The next step is to make arrangements for implementing the seven statutory management requirements, SMRs, applicable from 1 January 2006 and the three SMRs applicable from 1 January 2007. Work has already commenced in this respect.

My Department has since amended the legislation to strengthen the powers of the authorised officers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 to 217, inclusive, together.My Department has given considerable attention to food labelling as I regard it of importance that consumers are provided with full information on foodstuffs. In this regard, my Department has pursued assiduously the implementation of the recommendations of the food labelling group. Nineteen of the 21 recommendations, many of which were beyond the remit of my Department and some of which were to be activated only after others had been completed, have been addressed. The remaining two recommendations, which concern aspects of origin labelling, are also being addressed.Arising from the implementation of the group's recommendations, the enforcement of all food labelling regulations has been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This not only streamlines the enforcement measures but it also provides a one-stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food. In addition, the responsibility for food labelling policy, with the exception of fish, has been assigned to the Department of Health and Children and my Department, in accordance with another recommendation of the food labelling group.Accordingly, the Department of Health and Children is responsible for general labelling regulations which require information on food labels to be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer. My Department is responsible for more detailed legislation on the labelling of specific food products including beef and poultry meat. With regard to beef, EU regulations require operators to label their product with: a reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located; the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located; and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived.These labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to the marketing of beef within the Community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country and not all the above details are available, that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as "origin: non-EC", along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place. The labelling requirements under those regulations extend up to and including retail level and to the point of delivery into hotels, restaurants and catering establishments.Given the identified consumer demand for information on the country of origin of beef to be provided by the restaurant and catering sectors, I put specific proposals to the Government at the end of June for a legislative framework to facilitate this by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. This will be introduced under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 which will come before the Oireachtas this session. The appropriate regulations are being worked on concurrently and it is my intention to have these cleared at EU level as soon as possible. When the Act is amended and the regulations made, country of origin information will be available to consumers in respect of all beef served in restaurants, hotels and the entire catering sector in Ireland on a mandatory basis.The various representative bodies, including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and both of the vintners groups have agreed, following discussions with my Department, to recommend to their members the introduction on a voluntary basis of a mechanism for providing consumers on their premises with information on the country of origin of the beef served there in advance of the mandatory legal requirement. This agreement was recently finalised and these organisations are currently at various stages in that process. I expect the voluntary system will be in place in the near future.The beef sector has the most developed system of labelling within the EU legislative framework. With regard to poultry meat, two regulations were introduced in early 2004 requiring loose and pre-packaged poultry meat originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises and requiring information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose or non-packaged poultry meat to be provided to the consumer. I am having the possibility examined of further extending the labelling requirements for poultry meat, pig meat and sheep meat in order to have similar provisions to those for beef. This is not a straightforward matter as EU approval would be required and there is no precedent thus far of individual member states being allowed to extend meat labelling requirements internally beyond providing information that is already required by EU laws.There has also been a great deal of concern expressed about products imported into the Community and then processed in some way, allowing it to be described as a product of a member state. This is known as substantial transformation in the context of European customs regulations. Accordingly, any changes in this regard would have to be made with the agreement of the other member states. At a meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 28 February, I raised this issue in the context of the review on food labelling being carried out by the Commission.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of legislation governing genetically modified food and carries out regular checks of the marketplace to ensure compliance with genetically modified food legislation. I am satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of authorised genetically modified foods or foods containing genetically modified ingredients placed on the market in Ireland.

The Irish health care system is evolving and will provide a service which will best meet the needs of people here. The health strategy indicated that the Government was committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity and that additional capacity would be provided by a combination of public and private providers working in closer partnership.Notwithstanding the significant additional Exchequer funded investment in health services over the past few years, there remains a gap between public expectation levels and the capacity of the public system to fully address those expectations. It is vital, therefore, that benefits associated with the input of private financing in terms of addressing issues of access to and quality of services as well as sustainability in health care be fully exploited.In this regard, I recently issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive aimed at freeing up additional beds for public patients in public hospitals through the development of private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. This will improve access for public patients and provide a better quality of service.

My Department raised this matter with the HSE last May to ensure that approporiate transport arrangements are put in place on a national basis for patients who are required to travel to obtain radiotherapy. Transport solutions are already a feature of the current provision of radiation oncology services. My Department has asked the HSE to advise the Deputy directly in relation to current and proposed transport arrangements for radiation oncology patients nationally.Last July I announced the Government's plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. Appropriate transport arrangements will form part of the planning and implementation of this plan, given the significant increase in capacity involved.The National Radiation Oncology Co-ordinating Group, NROCG, provides advice to my Department and the HSE on radiotherapy. In light of what I have outlined and the fact that under the Health Act 2004 the HSE has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, the NROCG does not intend to prepare a specific report on transport.

Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically fully eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.With regard to investment income generally, the Health Service Executive takes the annual income from savings and investments into consideration in the assessment of means for a medical card. On the treatment of SSIA proceeds, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has recently announced increases in capital disregards to ensure that SSIA savings will not affect social welfare payments. I understand that the Health Service Executive is considering adopting a similar approach in medical card assessments. I will consult the HSE on this matter shortly.

The organisational design for the new body, as devised by the interim Health Service Executive, provided for the establishment of a number of national directorates. These include the primary, community and continuing care directorate which is responsible for the planning, management and delivery of all primary care, community based health and personal social services and continuing care hospitals and services. Since 1 September 2005, 32 local health offices, LHOs, established under this directorate, have responsibility and authority for the management of all services, other than acute hospital services, in their area.The executive's national hospitals office directorate is responsible for the provision of all public acute hospital care and ambulance pre-hospital emergency care. The management and delivery of these services is effected through ten hospital networks. Operational practice in the management and delivery of health and personal social services under these structures is a matter for the Health Service Executive. If the Deputy has a specific query on this aspect, he should relay it to the executive's parliamentary affairs division, Health Service Executive, Mezzanine Floor, Stewarts Sports Centre, Waterstown Avenue, Palmerstown, Dublin 20, Phone 01 6426952 and e-mail address HelenM.Stokes@mailf.hse.ie.

Responsibility for the future configuration of acute hospital services, taking into account the recommendations of the report by the national task force on medical staffing, now rests with the Health Service Executive. The key priority is to ensure that patients, wherever they live, have access to high quality hospital care.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	638	Under Regulation (EC) 1408/71, a person who is eligible for health services in Ireland, is accepted by the Health Service Executive as being ordinarily resident or is an EU national employed in Ireland, and who becomes ill or injured while on a temporary stay in the territory of a member state of the EU, EEA or Switzerland is entitled to receive health care through the public health care system of that member state. The European Health Insurance Card, which replaced the form E111 on 1 June 2004, provides evidence of this entitlement.It should be noted that the card does not cover the cost of treatment in a private setting. Card holders are advised on the public information website and leaflet about the EHIC to contact their local HSE office or log on to www.ehic.ie for more information about their entitlements in particular countries.In the event of an Irish resident falling ill while at sea there is a marine rescue service which is operated by the coastguard service of individual EU/EEA countries. In cases where the appropriate course of action is to transport the patient to a hospital in one of these countries, the service is provided and health care costs are paid by the Health Service Executive.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	646	On 1 September 2004 the Government, following a review of the timescales for all tribunals and inquiries, decided that the post mortem inquiry should furnish its final report not later than the 31 March 2005 and that the inquiry would then cease to exist. The chairman of the inquiry was so advised and subsequently delivered a report on 31 March 2005. The report dealt primarily with post mortem practice and procedure in paediatric hospitals. However, following consideration, the Attorney General advised the report should not be published for legal and constitutional reasons.On 3 May last, the Government approved the appointment of Dr. Deirdre Madden, BL, a distinguished expert on medical law and ethics, to provide me with a report on post mortem practice and organ retention by 21 December 2005. In view of the tight timeframe for her work and, in order to deliver a comprehensive report by the December deadline, it was decided to concentrate on children who were under 12 years of age. While Dr Madden's report will not deal specifically with adults, it is envisaged that some of her findings will have general application.

My Department has not funded any research in its province that would lead to the deliberate destruction of human embryos.The work of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction is directly related to this issue and I was pleased to receive its report last May. As I indicated at that time, the Government has decided to refer the report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children; this will allow for further public and political consideration of the complex issues involved. After this process, the Government will make decisions on the regulation of assisted human reproduction in Ireland on the basis of both the commission's and the Oireachtas committee's reports.

At that time, the number of applications awaiting inter-country adoption assessment was 1,829. Currently, waiting times for assessment range from three to six months in the HSE north-west region to 45 months in the HSE mid-west region, with the average waiting time of approximately 18 months Factors that have affected the service and waiting lists include the increasing number of applicants, from 232 in 2000 to 1,033 in 2004, a three and a half fold increase in just five years; the significant increase in the number of post-placement reports resulting from the increase in successful applicants; and population movements within Ireland, which have also shifted the pattern of demand, increasing it in particular areas.Over the same period the number of social work staff working on inter-country adoption assessments has increased from 38.7 whole-time equivalents in 2000 to 46 whole-time equivalents in 2004.The Adoption Board and the HSE recently reached agreement on measures to tackle the waiting lists. These include a review of the waiting times and the immediate application of the €1 million in additional, ongoing funding I provided earlier this year to tackle the backlog of applications, the funding distribution to take account of the existing demand in each HSE area; the application process will be improved to ensure the most efficient use of administrative and social work time and to identify ineligible or unsuitable applicants early on in the process; and a general review by the Adoption Board and the HSE of the operation of the standardised framework for inter-country adoption to identify measures which will ensure sustainable improvements. The HSE reform programme affords the opportunity to review the provision of adoption services. The Adoption Board has agreed to fund this important review.

Moneys are made available each year, formerly through the health boards and now through the Health Service Executive, for the provision of services to women victims of violence. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in funding so that over €12 million is provided annually for the provision of such services. The distribution of this funding is a matter for the Health Service Executive.I asked the HSE, together with my Department, to carry out an analysis of the current level of service provision in this area and to report back to me. I have been informed by the HSE that the final draft report is complete. The publication of the report into the examination of the service requirements of rape victims is imminent.

Considerable progress has been made in service development since the publication of the report and, in each of the years since 1999, my Department has provided additional funding to psychiatry of old age, over €5 million, and to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, over €2 million, for services delivered. In addition, carers of Alzheimer sufferers have benefited from the €5 million we have made available, in the same period, specifically for the support of carers. The Health Service Executive is also making progress in the provision of stand-alone dementia units on a gradual basis. All of the above provisions apply to all dementia sufferers, regardless of age.The Alzheimer Society of Ireland launched a document entitled Early Onset Dementia: A Needs Analysis of Younger People with Dementia in Ireland.

It is used for the purpose of treating public patients who have been waiting longest for surgery. Up to the end of September approximately 36,000 patients have had treatment arranged for them by the NTPF. It is now the case that, in most instances, anyone waiting more than three months will be facilitated by the fund.While the majority of procedures funded by the NTPF to date have been carried out in private hospitals in Ireland, my Department has been informed by the NTPF that the prices negotiated by the NTPF compare favourably with the comparative benchmarks available for the costs of the vast majority of procedures.On foot of the commitment in the health strategy, funding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds and day places in acute hospitals. Some 797 beds are in place and the Health Service Executive has informed my Department that the remaining 103 beds or places will come on stream during the coming months.It should be noted that acute hospital activity has increased significantly in recent years. There were over one million inpatient and day case discharges from acute hospitals in 2004, representing an increase of approximately 33% since 1997.A policy direction has recently issued to the HSE which is aimed at freeing up additional beds for public patients in public hospitals through the development of private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, will be reviewing public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in the light of developments since the health strategy and the progress of this initiative.

In respect of local representatives it specifically includes in Part 8 under section 42 provision for the establishment of a number of regional health forums. These forums will facilitate local representatives in raising issues of local concern in relation to health services within their region with the executive. Membership of the forums will be based on nominations from city and county councils within the functional areas of each forum. Putting such arrangements in place will ensure that the voice of local public representatives will continue to be heard in relation to the development of health services.These arrangements are designed to complement and reinforce the role of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in reflecting the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health services. The regulations will specify the following: the title of each forum and define its functional area; the number of members for each forum; the number of members from each city and county council to be nominated to each forum; and the requirements relating to the manner in which the functions of a forum are to be performed. They will also set out the procedures for the following: appointing members to a forum; the election of a chairperson and vice-chairperson of a forum; filling of casual vacancies; the meetings of a forum; the establishment of committees and the appointment of their members; and ensuring the proper administration of each forum.My Department has been engaged in a consultation process regarding the proposed regulations and, as a result of these consultations, I hope to finalise the regulations and lay them before the Houses shortly, with a view to establishing the forums very soon afterwards.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	679	Section 41 of the Health Act 2004 provides for the convening of a national health consultative forum to advise me, in my capacity as Minister, on matters relating to the provision of health and personal social services as defined in the Act. This forum will replace the national consultative forum on the health strategy which has been convened annually since 2002. The strategy forum will be held in December this year. The strategy forum participants are primarily drawn from senior management in the health system, the voluntary sector, patient and client groups, service providers, trade unions, professional bodies, Departments and other sectoral interests.My Department is preparing a ministerial order on the membership, rules and procedures of the national health consultative forum. While its composition has yet to be decided by me, it is envisaged, having regard to the provisions of the Act, that its membership will be on similar lines to the existing strategy forum.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The recent report by the Joint Committee on Health and Children is a follow up to its earlier report of 2002, The Orthodontic Service in Ireland. As the committee makes clear, the report should be read as an appendix to the 2002 report.The Deputy will be aware that under the Dentists Act 1985 the regulation of professional education and training in dentistry is statutorily vested by the Oireachtas in the Dental Council alone. The Dental Council is the competent authority in Ireland for issuing certificates that internationally recognise dentists who have completed specialist training in orthodontics. It is the Dental Council, through the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry, that decides whether to accredit specialist training regimes. The Minister for Health and Children does not have a statutory role in the recognition of training regimes in dentistry.My Department is not the employer of the person to whom the Deputy refers. The Department has, in the past, dealt with allegations made by the person referred to by the Deputy against officials of this Department. The Department carried out an examination of the allegations and found no evidence to support them.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a number of measures have been adopted to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the orthodontic service. My Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, have funded 22 dentists from various HSE areas for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. The most recent group of 13 trainees have now completed their training and have taken up posts in the HSE since 1 October 2005. This means that almost half the orthodontists in Ireland are now working in the public health service.My Department has been informed by the HSE that, at the end of the June 2005 quarter, there were 23,216 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are over twice as many patients getting orthodontic treatment as there are waiting to be treated and more than 7,000 extra patients are getting treatment from the HSE since the end of the June 2001 quarter. The improvement in quality of treatment and numbers being treated is directly attributable to the steps that have already been taken and will continue to be taken to ensure ongoing improvements to the service. The addition of 13 specialists in orthodontics to the service since 1 October 2005 will have a further significant impact on numbers in treatment and waiting lists.My Department has met the HSE regarding the latest joint committee report. Since that meeting the HSE, to ensure ongoing training, has committed funding for the training of a further four orthodontists. My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is considering each of the recommendations set out in the report of the joint committee.

This order enables VAT paid on qualifying goods to be refunded where the goods are purchased for the exclusive use of disabled persons suffering a specified degree of disablement. Visually impaired persons are regarded as coming within the terms of this order and VAT refunds are regularly made in respect of qualifying items considered necessary to that particular disability. For such persons, qualifying items would include specially adapted computer equipment, braille books, braille writing equipment, braille converters and radar devices.If the Deputy has a particular case or particular component in mind, he should contact the VAT Repayments Section in the Revenue Commissioners, Government Offices, Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare, who would be glad to clarify the position.

In the case of the sale of a new house or apartment to a purchaser, VAT applies at the reduced rate of 13.5% both on its construction and on the site where these are connected contracts and is included in the final price of the property to the purchaser. No VAT applies in respect of the purchase of a second-hand house. However, VAT, also at 13.5%, applies on housing repair and maintenance. The relevant information available in respect of VAT is the estimated yield as follows.YearNew housingHousing repair and maintenanceTotal€m€m€m19973672055721998494217711199964128993120008093321,14120019273821,30920021,1003361,43620031,5413321,87320041,9993642,364The figures given for the VAT raised in 2003 are a revision of figures provided previously. The revision was necessitated by more accurate information becoming available in the interim.In the case of stamp duty, the figures available are of the total collected from residential property. However, data are not collected in a manner that would enable a more detailed breakdown of the annual yield to be provided as between second-hand and relevant new residential property. Stamp duty is also chargeable on transfers of sites at the appropriate rates for non-residential property but it is not possible to determine what proportion of the total stamp duty yield on non-residential property relates to site transfers. The following table shows the figures for stamp duty yield from residential property for each of the years 1997 to 2004 and for 2005 to the end of July 2005.Year€m199719419982131999263200028220012652002349200352820047522005 (to end July)464The end-July 2005 figure is provisional and subject to revision. The stamp duty figures shown are estimated for 1997 to 2000, inclusive, because the breakdown in the yield figures for property as between residential and non-residential is approximate only for those years. As regards CGT, the precise information requested by the Deputy is not available.

The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty, supply disruptions and strong economic growth in catch-up countries such as China. Mineral oil taxes are a factor influencing fuel prices.As the Deputy will be aware, changes in taxation are made in the context of the annual budget and, accordingly, any requests made regarding changes in tax rates are considered in the period leading up to the budget. The Deputy will appreciate that it is neither practical nor prudent to adjust tax rates between budgets. However, it should be noted that Ireland's mineral oil tax on petrol and diesel is below that of our main EU trading partners and, as the Deputy may be aware, I did not increase taxation on motor fuels of any description in last year's budget.A submission has been made to me in this connection on behalf of the licensed haulage industry by the Irish Road Haulage Association and officials of my Department met representatives of that association recently. The proposals made in its submission, which were elaborated on at the aforementioned meeting, will be examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	688	Section 12 of the Finance Act 2005 provides for the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs or a relevant other Minister, to certify as exempt from taxation certain allowances which provide compensation to officers of the State for the extra costs of having to live outside the State in order to perform their duties. The provision is aimed mainly at civil servants attached to diplomatic missions but it also covers members of the Garda Síochána and the Permanent Defence Force on certain overseas postings. The purpose of the provision was to give a statutory basis to a de facto position where these allowances were treated as exempt from tax by the State. It is also in line with the general international practice of exempting such allowances from tax.The additional costs for State employees posted abroad vary from one foreign location to another but may arise in respect of differences in costs of living, extra costs in the performance of duties, accommodation costs and additional expenses relating to the care and education of children. There are approximately 340 officers of the State, mainly officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who are in receipt of allowances covered by the exemption.The tax treatment of these allowances reflects the fact that they are calculated to cover the additional costs incurred by officers of the State who are posted abroad. Section 12 clarifies the tax position of such officers but does not give rise to any additional Exchequer costs. The question of retrospection did not arise as the provision gave legal effect to an existing long-standing practice.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 to 295, inclusive, together.Capital allowances for the construction of private nursing homes were introduced in Finance Act 1998. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to estimate the number of nursing homes which have benefited from this tax incentive. This is because the normal self-assessment tax return form does not distinguish between capital allowances claimed in respect of private nursing homes from those claimed in respect of other buildings entitled to capital allowances. Consequently, it is not possible for Revenue to indicate the level of take up of this specific incentive. Similarly, the Revenue Commissioners have no information on the numbers of nursing homes where capital allowances have been clawed back.As part of ongoing commitments to improve the quality of information available on the costs of tax expenditures generally, the Revenue Commissioners have introduced a number of changes to certain tax forms which will yield additional information regarding the cost of various reliefs and the number of taxpayers availing of them. Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 to underpin these changes. This will provide better data in this area and enable fuller estimates of the tax forgone to be made over time. Consultancy studies nearing completion will also provide significant additional data in this regard.The capital allowances were introduced in Finance Act 1998 with effect from 3 December 1997. The latest information from the Department of Health and Children is that the number of beds in private nursing homes increased from 6,932 at the end of 1997 to 13,178 in December 2003. The new capital allowances incentive for nursing homes would have caused some of this increase in bed capacity but the Department of Health and Children does not have any information on this matter.

In the case of the health sector, sanction to spend this money is provided by this Department on an annual basis. This sanction is subject to a series of general and specific conditions, including adherence to national and EU requirements in relation to capital appraisal and procurement issues. In this context, all Departments and offices must comply with the Department of Finance's guidelines for appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector. The systematic appraisal and professional management of all capital projects helps to ensure that the best choices are made and that the best value for money is obtained.The Deputy may be referring to my Department's letter of sanction in respect of the Health Service Executive's capital expenditure for 2005. In the context of this sanction, concerns were raised regarding the projected ongoing staffing and other costs relating to the Longford-Westmeath hospital. In this regard, my Department's sanction was subject to the Department of Health and Children arranging for an independent review of these costs. This sanction also stated that my Department's specific sanction should be obtained before the Mater project can proceed to tender. This condition was included to ensure that my Department and the Department of Health and Children are satisfied that all proper procedures have been followed in the context of the procurement process, that the necessary capital funding is in place for the duration of the project and that ongoing staffing and resource issues arising out of the project are considered and addressed in advance of signing of contracts.

I am also informed that Revenue has an internal security policy that monitors any apparent irregular or excessive viewing or accessing of taxpayer records of any individuals. While there are indications that access to the records of the individual in question might be slightly higher than normal during the past two months, it is not possible to conclude without further inquiries that this access was not necessary for normal business reasons. I am informed by Revenue that they are carrying out further inquiries in this matter as part of their internal security procedures and that they will take any action that is appropriate in the light of the findings of the inquiries.

The Exchequer cost of the scheme to date is as outlined above. The estimated cost in 2005, based on the average tax credit payout in the first eight months of 2005, is €587 million but this is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be different if account holders change their monthly contributions. The total gross cost over the period of the scheme will be reduced by the exit tax to be received at the end. For these reasons, together with the fact that any gains arising is a matter for the relevant financial institution, it is not possible to estimate the total amount of subscriptions upon completion of the scheme and the amount available to SSIA holders on maturity.

This is under way and the European Commission is looking at options to improve the transparency of oil markets with respect to available data.

With respect to current international agreements, the Government is fully committed to the Kyoto Protocol and the international response to combat climate change. I am open-minded towards initiatives in the tax area which can impact positively on the environment but in reviewing any such initiatives have to be mindful of competitiveness issues and the impact of any particular measure across the overall community.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	698	The Austrian Chancellor recently stated there should be an automatic financing mechanism for part of the EU budget, for example, through taxation of international financial transactions. The issue of a currency transactions tax, Tobin tax, has been considered in several fora, including the informal ECOFIN meeting at Liege on 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, most EU Finance Ministers at that time had reservations about the Tobin tax proposal. Many believed it was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax, including the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other, non-taxable, alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market. I am of the same view.Nevertheless, at a formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. The study, Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that "while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated". This issue has also been raised at EU level in 2005 in the context of the financing of development aid but was dismissed by the EU Commission for reasons such as those already outlined. As indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions on this matter, I do not propose to introduce such a tax as I remain unconvinced of its feasibility.

However, because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the breakdown by income bands requested by the Deputy is not provided for incomes exceeding €1 million due to the small numbers of income earners with incomes in excess of that level.A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit. Married couples and individuals with income chargeable to tax under both schedule E and schedule D have been classified in the attached tables by reference to the schedule under which the larger amount of income is taxable.The designation of a tax rate to an income earner in the tables is based on identifying the top tax rate applying to the taxable income of each earner. To arrive at the figure for taxable income, the gross income is reduced by various relevant deductions and allowances such as capital allowances, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities. In some cases, these will reduce the taxable income to nil. The information on incomes is based on income returns on Revenue's records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 95% of all returns expected.Numbers of all income earners with incomes exceeding €100,000Range of Gross Income*No net liability for income taxLiable for tax at the standard rate (20%) or marginal reliefLiable for tax at the higher rate (42%)OverallSingle*MarriedTotalSingle*MarriedTotalSingle*MarriedTotalTotal100,000 110,0008212991011101,2557,9089,1639,302110,000 120,00031518553588575,3816,2386,314120,000 130,00012223358616453,8274,4724,556130,000 140,00031316332354822,9013,3833,434140,000 150,0002810324273842,2322,6162,653150,000 160,00051116025253021,7942,0962,137160,000 170,000033122232621,4961,7581,784170,000 180,000257119202101,2691,4791,506180,000 190,000279416201771,0551,2321,261190,000 200,000437111121509681,1181,137200,000 210,00015611011132842974991210,000 220,000066088133651784798220,000 230,00007701010109585694711230,000 240,00015616782499581594240,000 250,00010111274521595598250,000 260,00000001162401463464260,000 270,00014516759371430442270,000 280,000022281054338392404280,000 290,00011201153300353356290,000 300,00012301144279323327300,000 310,00021301139271310314310,000 320,00003304431228259266320,000 330,0000000000000330,000 340,00003305568399467475340,000 350,00011212333188221226350,000 360,00000002222179201203360,000 370,00002201117149166169370,000 380,00000002226127153155380,000 390,00001111221132153156390,000 400,00001101112102114116400,000 410,00014500027118145150410,000 420,00002202221103124128420,000 430,00000002214108122124430,000 440,00000001112799192440,000 450,0001120111494108111450,000 460,00001100017769394460,000 470,00000000014779191470,000 480,0000110009758485480,000 490,0000000115707576490,000 500,00000010113526566500,000 510,00001101111637476510,000 520,0000000229657476520,000 530,0000000228455355530,000 540,00000000013546767540,000 550,0000000007394646550,000 560,0000000113545758560,000 570,0000000007445151570,000 580,0000000002464848580,000 590,0000000002333535590,000 600,0000000003353838600,000 610,0000000114343839610,000 620,0000000007273434620,000 630,0000220116283437630,000 640,0000110009374647640,000 650,0000110004313536650,000 660,0000000005323737660,000 670,0000110112313335670,000 680,0000110004202425680,000 690,0000000003232626690,000 700,0000000005374242700,000 710,0000000003262929710,000 720,0000000114252930720,000 730,0000000004222626730,000 740,0000000006273333740,000 750,0000000004252929750,000 760,0000110001161718760,000 770,0000000001171818770,000 780,0000000001121313780,000 790,0000001123121517790,000 800,0000000110181819800,000 810,0000000000131313810,000 820,0000110001678820,000 830,0000110002111314830,000 840,0000000001111212840,000 850,0000000002101212850,000 860,0000000002161818860,000 870,000000011291112870,000 880,0000110000131314880,000 890,000000011191011890,000 900,0000000111789900,000 910,0000000001101111910,000 920,0000000001899920,000 930,000000000291111930,000 940,0000000003588940,000 950,0000000110445950,000 960,0000000001788960,000 970,0000000000666970,000 980,0000000003477980,000 990,0000000000999890,000 900,0000000001566Over 1,000,0001451566735942643742176218414605016,17337,75443,92744,646"Single" includes widowed persons.

I am advised by the Marine Institute that in early September anglers had noticed that some salmon caught on the River Blackwater were infected with a parasite. Samples were analysed and the parasite was identified as Anisakis species. Anisakis is not uncommon. The best advice to the public is to observe good hygiene practice by washing hands after handling fresh fish and to thoroughly cook fish as normal. The most important thing to emphasise is that parasites in fish are parasites of cold-water animals. Once the flesh of the fish is well cooked there is no risk to human health.The occurrence of this parasite does not represent serious infectious pressure to the coarse fish population. Salmon can be intermediate hosts or occasionally final hosts for this parasite. In order for freshwater fish to become infected, they must eat returning salmon, or possibly flesh from dead salmon. If freshwater fish were to become infected, they would merely act as another intermediate host. The life cycle of the parasite would not be completed in these freshwater fish. There can be no association between falling salmon numbers and the burden of Anisakis so far described. There is no history of high numbers in Irish salmon or of the capability of Anisakis to cause epidemics that might wipe out populations of fish. Indeed some authors describe Anisakis as being of little importance except for the human aspect. Anglers who are concerned about any apparent parasitic infestations or diseases in fish should contact their local regional fisheries board staff, who will know who to contact and how best to collect and preserve fish for examination.

The standards of service delivery in the postal sector are set out in the two European postal directives which outline the universal service obligations which universal service providers must honour, including An Post.The independent communications regulator, ComReg, is responsible for the monitoring, measurement and regulation of the postal sector including measuring the levels of service against those set out in the postal directives. The quality service target for the nationwide next day delivery of single piece priority mail set for An Post by ComReg during 2004 was 94%. The results of the measurement of compliance with this target reported that 78% of national mail was delivered the next day during the most recent measurement period. This represents an improvement of 8% on the similar period last year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	715	Sustainable Energy Ireland, which was established as a statutory agency in May 2002, implements a wide variety of programmes on energy efficiency and renewable energy on behalf of my Department. Under SEI's house of tomorrow research, development and demonstration programme, or HOT, financial support is directed at encouraging developers of housing, both new-build and refurbishment, to incorporate design and technology features which deliver significantly superior energy and CO2 performance. By targeting developers of schemes of houses, from the private or social housing sectors, the aim has been to establish over a number of years a nationwide network of accessible examples of more sustainable energy design and technology practices. With the accompaniment of other promotional measures by SEI, this is intended to encourage a sufficient degree of market replication, without subsidy, to elevate energy performance standards across the wider housing stock. This targeted approach is also designed to be an administratively efficient method for deployment of public moneys.To date the programme has committed over €9 million funding to 48 projects comprising a total 2,269 housing units. All feature an integrated approach to design, orientation, building fabric and energy supply and use that achieves performance of at least 20% better than current building regulations and, in the majority of projects, 40% better. The sustainable energy features across the range of projects funded include solar hot water systems, ground source heat pumps, condensing boilers, group heating schemes and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery along with higher levels of insulation. The programme has been directed at suppliers and developers of housing, rather than individual householders. There have been two main reasons for this. House of tomorrow is a research and development support scheme, not a home improvement grants scheme. It is seeking projects of sufficient scale and impact to influence wide application of the practices and technologies demonstrated. An effective way to achieve this is by means of clusters of homes, which will provide regionally visible and accessible examples and which can be replicated. Overall, integrated developments are encouraged.A key need in moving towards more energy efficient planning and construction practices in Irish homes is to develop the necessary awareness and capability within the construction industry. SEI, through its consumer awareness programmes, seeks to increase the demand for energy efficiency amongst homeowners and occupants. House of tomorrow, as a research, development and demonstration programme, supports the development and demonstration of capability in the industry to deliver higher quality energy efficient homes to meet such a demand. The aim is to increase standards and practices across the industry as a whole.Regular reviews are conducted on all SEI's funding programmes. Factors entering into any consideration of an individual grant scheme include the establishment of consumer product standards, supplier capability and installation quality assurance systems appropriate to consumer markets. This is in addition to the core requirements of energy and CO2 saving impact, market impact potential, administrative efficiency and ultimately, value for money for the taxpayer. Funding for SEI is determined on an annual basis. SEI submits a proposed work programme for the coming year along with a budget for each of its programmes, such as the house of tomorrow programme, to my Department. Any increase in funding required for these programmes would have budgetary implications and could only be considered in the light of the overall budgetary requirements of SEI and the level of funding available to my Department.That being said, I am keen to see a wider take up of energy-efficient technology in design, building and use of homes. While many of the measures involved are self-financing, with payback periods of as little as two or three years, I am looking at what might be needed to improve the rate of take-up and use. Increasing the energy efficiency of our building stock reduces our energy imports, reduces our CO2 emissions and saves money for the individual household and for the Exchequer.

In April 2005 I announced a change from competitive tendering to a feed-in tariff under the existing legislative basis in section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. I have no plans to propose changes to this legislative authority at this time. The support programme, in its current draft form, proposes that any applicant, whether an individual or company, may submit an application under the fixed-feed in support programme. The detailed terms and conditions of the proposed feed-in support programme were posted on my Department's website, www.dcmnr.gov.ie, in draft form, on 29 September 2005 and interested parties have until 12 October 2005 to raise any questions or to furnish any observations on the proposals, as published.

To examine the matter further, I established a working group comprising people with experience of the postal sector, together with a representative from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the Irish spatial data infrastructure initiative to examine the high level issues relating to the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland. This group produced its report earlier this year.The report found that the introduction of a publicly available postcode could deliver many potential benefits. The purpose of a postcode system would be to improve efficiencies and quality in the postal sector, to stimulate mail volume growth, to assist utilities and emergency services, to address the problem of non-unique addressing and to facilitate competition by making it easier for new postal operators to enter the market. These improvements collectively will boost the country's competitiveness. Following from the recommendations of the working group report, I asked the Commission for Communications Regulation to appoint project managers to support the postcode project by providing technical and economic advice including matching the costs and benefits of the introduction of a postcode. These managers will be supported by a national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments, together with public and private sector organisations which I appointed earlier this year.The precise nature and format of any proposed postcode system has yet to be decided but it will fall within the remit of the postcode project board to examine a broad range of possible models including the costs and benefits of introducing the models. It is hoped that the project managers will present a proposal describing in sufficient detail what is the most efficient, effective and most publicly usable postcode system by 31 December 2005 with a launch date of no later than January 2008.

Where aspects of the development covered by legislation administered by my Department required consultation with local people, this was carried out in accordance with the requisite statutory provisions. The overall Corrib project required separate statutory approvals, consent and licences in respect of six separate elements under various legislative enactments. The elements of the project examined and approved within my Department's responsibility are as follows: under the Continental Shelf Act 1968, for construction of the offshore installation within the continental shelf designated areas, consent was given on 15 April 2002 by the then Minister for Marine and Natural Resources; under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, the plan of development approval, subject to a number of conditions, was given on 15 April 2002 by the then Minister for Marine and Natural Resources; under the Gas Act 1976, as amended, consent was given on 15 April 2002 by the then Minister for Marine and Natural Resources for the construction of a gas pipeline from the gas field through the offshore up to the terminal building - this is an integral part of the plan of development approval of 15 April 2005; under the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended, a foreshore licence was granted by the then Minister for Marine and Natural Resources on 17 May 2002, in respect of the routing of the pipelines through the foreshore connecting the gas field to the land-based installation. I am satisfied that the regulatory processes were fully complied with.My Department is currently reviewing the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, as amended, with a view to producing an updated petroleum legislative framework, as well as the Continental Shelf Act 1968. While I have no direct responsibility for planning regulatory matters, planning laws or licensing matters concerning the Environmental Protection Agency, approval given by my predecessor in respect of the plan for development of the field was subject to a number of conditions. Amongst these was the requirement to obtain all necessary planning permissions and an integrated pollution control licence.

The feasibility study, completed in 2002, does not identify any significant fishing activity at Doolin Harbour to justify an investment of the nature proposed. The development needs at Doolin are required to allow the continuation of Doolin's existence as a major access point to the Aran Islands. I regret there is no funding available in the Department for projects that are primarily island access projects.

The Maritime Safety Act 2005 added the port companies referred to above to the list of State bodies to which the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 does not apply. This Act provides, inter alia, for a general right to acquire the fee simple.The ports policy statement published earlier this year states that the Department acknowledges the view of port companies that the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts impose restrictions on their ability to effectively facilitate the development within their ports of an efficient and competitive market for port services, including new entrants. The ports policy statement indicates that, as recommended by the high level review of the State commercial ports, published in May 2003, the Department intends to give consideration, in the context of future legislative changes, to the possible adaptation of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts to the particular circumstances of the ports.The changes contemplated may provide for port companies to be exempted from landlord and tenants legislation in its entirety, similar to the position pertaining with regard to the State airports. It should be noted that any legislative amendment in this regard would not have retrospective effect.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	727	I am happy that the current arrangements, and the proposals for further development which are outlined below, provide for an effective passport issuing service.By the end of September 2005, almost 500,000 passports had been issued by the Passport Office this year. This is over 10% higher than in the same period last year. At the end of the year, I expect that a record 550,000 passports will have been issued. Over 90% of these are issued within ten working days. The majority come through the "passport express" service which is operated jointly by my Department and An Post and which is available in over 1,000 past offices nationwide.In response to increasing demand for passports in recent years, as well as requirements for higher security standards and a commitment to offer our citizens the most effective possible service, the passport issuing system has been going through a process of modernisation and upgrading. A new automated passport system has been introduced in the past year in the main Passport Office in Molesworth Street, Dublin 2, and in a new passport production facility in Balbriggan, County Dublin. The system is being extended this month to the Cork and London passport offices and I expect that the roll out to all missions will be completed by the end of the year. Our new passport booklet is one of the most secure in the world and has been widely admired.In addition to the above, my Department is working on developing on-line facilities to enable applicants to track the progress of their application over the Internet. It is hoped that this facility will be available towards the end of the year. Work is also under way to develop an on-line passport application facility allowing applicants to submit personal details, other than photograph and signature, over the Internet. This is expected to be available next year.Ireland, along with other member states of the European Union, is preparing to incorporate biometric identifiers in passports before the end of 2006 to further improve passport security. This will involve storing, in a microchip to be embedded in the passport, a digital image of the passport holder's face taken from the photograph submitted along with the passport application form.It is my policy to keep the operations of the Passport Office under regular and active review so that the best possible service can be maintained for the public. However, in view of the ongoing developments set out above, there would be no justification in extending the number of passport offices within the State.

It had also previously been allocated funding of €19,046 in 1997 and €63,487 in 2000. In addition, the organisation may receive a top-up to the 2005 grant from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs as the project is located in a designated disadvantaged area, being located in a CLÁR region. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, will be announcing such top-ups in the near future.While the organisation has submitted most of the documentation required to draw down its 2005 grant, it is aware that a deed of covenant and charge must be executed by my Department's legal advisers, the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO, before grant payments can be made. The requirement for such a deed is standard practice in regard to State funding and provides for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. The CSSO is in contact with the organisation's solicitors to progress the execution of the deed of covenant and charge, following which my Department will be in a position to progress payments to the organisation in question.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	730	Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with overall responsibility for administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. A lack of clear communication and of understanding in any workplace could potentially pose a risk to the health and safety of the workers therein. It is clear that there are many workers who do not have English as a first language and, accordingly, it is appropriate that employers and those who are in control of workplaces in this country put in place clear systems of communication to ensure that all safety critical information is conveyed clearly to all workers in the workplace.The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act at section 9 sets out the type of information on safety, health and welfare required to be given by employers to employees. It specifies that the information must be in a form, manner and language that can be understood. It must include information on hazards, risks and measures taken as regards safety, health and welfare as well as the names of emergency staff and safety representatives.Furthermore, the 2005 Act, at section 20, provides that an employer is obliged to prepare a written safety statement, based on the identification of hazards and an assessment of risks. This statement, which sets out how the safety, health and welfare of the employees will be secured and managed, must also be in a form, manner and, as appropriate, language that can be understood.In addition to the statutory obligations set out above, the Health and Safety Authority recognises the new challenges that the growth of non-English speaking people within the workforce brings. This is evidenced by the launch this year of a new authority initiative, safe system of work plan, aimed at reducing injuries and deaths in construction and allied work.The initiative relies heavily on pictograms to explain and clarify hazards and controls, thereby creating a wordless document where safety can be communicated to all workers regardless of literacy or language skills. The safe system of work plan aims to focus on those who are most at risk, allowing them to ensure that all necessary safety controls are in place prior to the commencement of planned work. In addition, the Health and Safety Authority is working on the production of explanatory leaflets in a number of different languages.The new statutory provisions in the 2005 Act and the safe system of work plan initiatives are aimed at meeting the new challenges evolving in our economy due to the changing nature of the workforce. Signage and instruction to motorists is a matter for the Minister for Transport and his Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	731	I am aware of the correspondence to which the Deputy refers concerning the acceptability of the EU funding ethically sensitive research activity, which arose in the context of the recent adoption by the European Commission of its specific programmes under the proposed seventh research framework programme, FP7. The Government is fully conscious that the ethical framework within which research is carried out, particularly in the context of the EU funded framework programmes, has given rise to significant ethical concerns among member states and the European Parliament especially with regard to the use of human embryonic stems cells.The current sixth framework programme, FP6, decided by Council in agreement with Parliament, explicitly forbids EU funding for research that involves human reproductive cloning, the creation of human embryos for research, often referred to as therapeutic cloning, and research that would change the genetic heritage. However, FP6, which covers the period 2003 to 2006, does allow EU funding of projects involving the derivation and use of human embryonic stem cells derived from supernumerary embryos.The Department of Health and Children is responsible for ethical issues in the health and related areas and, during the course of the negotiations at EU level on FP6, it advised on the approach to be taken by Ireland on such issues. In this regard, in discussions at Council on the issue of stem cell research under FP6, Ireland considered it inappropriate to object to the EU funding of such research in member states where it is legal and deemed ethical and, consequently, it did not oppose the Commission's proposal, that is, the core principle of respecting "ethical subsidiarity" was guaranteed.Under FP6 the funding of such ethically sensitive projects is dealt with through a process of ethical review and must conform to the ethical rules of the current programme. In summary, the current rules state that all projects that raise any ethical questions are submitted to a rigorous four stage process before being funded: national ethical review, European scientific review, European ethical review and consideration by a committee of member states. EU research programmes never fund in a member state, under any circumstances, anything that is not legal or is deemed unethical in that particular member state. In this regard, I can confirm that no EU funding has been committed to such research projects in Ireland. Funding is being provided by Science Foundation Ireland for regenerative medical research involving stem cells deriving from adult sources.The seventh framework programme is due to commence at the beginning of 2007 and is scheduled to run until 2013. In presenting its proposal for FP7, the Commission has stated that it has adopted a no-change policy with regard to the respect of fundamental ethical principles in research activity. This explicitly respects the positions of those member states whose legal and ethical regimes forbid such research.The detailed technical examination of the FP7 specific programmes will be undertaken by member states over the coming months and the aim is to ensure that a final decision, taking into consideration the views of the European Parliament, is secured so as to enable a smooth transition from FP6 to FP7. In this regard, I have sought the advice of the Minister for Health and Children on the position to be adopted by Ireland on the ethical issues that arise in respect of EU funded research activities in the Commission's proposals.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	734	The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational matter for the industrial development agencies and relevant county enterprise boards, and not one in which I have a direct role. IDA Ireland informs me that it continues to market south County Dublin, including Tallaght and its environs, as a potential location for new foreign direct investment, FDI, to secure new investment and additional jobs for the region.IDA Ireland's strategy for the Dublin area is to attract and expand major FDI projects, moving up the value chain. South County Dublin is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment given its superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle and its third level institute of technology at Tallaght.Sectors such as life sciences, including pharmaceuticals, provide high-value employment. This year the Japanese pharmaceuticals company Takeda Chemical Industries will complete construction of its facility at Grangecastle, Clondalkin. Greencastle is within easy commuting distance of Tallaght and the plant will employ more than 60 people upon completion. This is a significant and important investment from a leading company in Japan and will highlight Ireland as a key location for other such Japanese investors in the future. Also in Grangecastle, the pharmaceutical company Wyeth Biopharma opened this year and already employs approximately 900 highly skilled people. Wyeth Biopharma continues to recruit and will eventually employ 1,300 at the facility in Greencastle.Enterprise Ireland works with companies in its portfolio to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation so they can compete in world markets. The agency is encouraging companies to adopt new technologies to add value to their products and services. Since the beginning of 2002, Enterprise Ireland has approved over €9.6 million and made payments of over €9 million in support of development projects for indigenous companies in south County Dublin.Enterprise Ireland is also actively involved with the provision of infrastructure to facilitate business development and employment. The agency has provided funding for the development of community enterprise centres in south Dublin such as Brookfield, Bolbrook and Killinarden. These centres provide incubation space for start-ups and micro-enterprises, and also provide ancillary services such as training, mentoring and customised courses to address the needs of the local clients.Enterprise Ireland also supports the development of business incubation workspace as part of its ongoing commitment to fostering links between colleges and industry and has provided €2.54 million towards the development of incubation space at the Tallaght Institute of Technology. It is anticipated that graduates from the college or members of research teams based in the college will be to the forefront in using the centre and in creating new jobs, particularly in the high-tech sectors.The South Dublin County Enterprise Board is also proactively involved in the development of indigenous enterprise and provides a source of support for small businesses in the region. The Tallaght area represents just over one third of the population of the county. Since its inception, the board has approved just over €3.4 million to businesses based in Tallaght. These grants and other financial supports have resulted in the creation and maintenance of 320 jobs.

The group's final report, Make Consumers Count, was published in May of this year. The report emphasises the importance of empowering consumers so they can make informed choices and reap the benefits of freely functioning competitive markets. The consumer strategy group has suggested a way forward in terms of consumer protection policy, particularly in terms of how the balance of power can be shifted more toward the consumer and has made over 30 separate recommendations as to how this can be achieved.The group's core recommendation that a new statutory body, the national consumer agency, be established to advocate the consumer's case has already been accepted by the Government. My Department has begun work to ensure that the new agency be formally established as soon as possible.In the interim, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs continues to play an important role in the area of consumer protection particularly in terms of enforcing the wide range of existing consumer laws and regulations. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that my Department recently increased significantly the sanctions for breaches of those laws. To build upon the work of the ODCA and to ensure that the momentum of the report of the consumer strategy group is maintained and that the consumer's voice is heard, I recently appointed a board to the new agency to act in an interim capacity until the agency is formally established.The Deputy will be aware that since its appointment, the board had been very active on issues such as the debate on the future of the groceries order, the cost of goods and services etc. It is vital that these and other consumer debates are not dominated by vested interests, as has happened heretofore, and that the consumer's case is forcefully advocated. I am confident that the interim board will continue to be a forceful advocate for the consumer until the full national consumer agency is established. In this regard, I am aware that the board intends to increase significantly its activities in terms of consumer awareness, advocacy and information campaigns.I am satisfied that the report of the consumer strategy group does offer the way forward. The report re-emphasises the importance of promoting competition and empowering consumers. I am confident that the application of these policies in conjunction with the work of agencies such as the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the interim board of the national consumer agency will help to ensure that consumers get a fair deal.

The Act applies to all sectors of the economy in the State.All entities covered by the Act must ensure that they do not infringe the prohibitions in the Act. The Act covers "undertakings" which are defined as "a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service". This definition has been used in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by European case law. Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the Industrial Relations Acts in this regard.

All gross yearly income, both on the farm and off-farm, engaged in by the farmer and his or her spouse or partner is reduced to allow for all costs necessarily incurred in carrying out the self-employed assessment. In addition, €254 per annum of the net income is disregarded for each of the first two qualified children and €381 per annum is disregarded for each subsequent child. Of the remaining balance, 70% of the balance is assessed as means. Any change in the current arrangements relating to the assessment of the farm assist scheme would have budgetary implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.

A qualified adult increase at the maximum rate is payable where the spouse's or partner's income is less than €88.89 per week, and tapered reduced rates are payable where income is less than €220 per week. The lower threshold was last increased in budget 2000 while the upper threshold has been increased in each successive budget since then, from £135 in 2000 to €220 in the budget for 2005. Any change in the current arrangements relating to entitlement to qualified adult allowances would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.

Amounts held in special savings investment accounts are treated in the same manner as other capital. Last October, I requested my Department to carry out an examination of the current arrangements for the assessment of capital, particularly in so far as they apply to SSIAs, with a view to bringing forward proposals in the budget for 2005.On budget day, I was pleased to announce that the amount of capital disregarded for means test purposes for all schemes — except supplementary welfare allowance — was being increased from €12,694.38 to €20,000, an increase of over €7,300. The enhanced disregard applies to all capital regardless of where it is held, be it in an SSIA, a credit union, with An Post or any other account with a bank or other financial institution.The new arrangements mean that a single non-contributory pensioner, with no other means, can have capital of up to €28,000 and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple. The new arrangements were designed to ensure that social welfare means testing arrangements do not act as a disincentive to claimants to become savers or to penalise those who have been regular savers in the past.

Neither I nor my Department has any function regarding decisions on individual claims. A person may qualify for payment of a back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, or is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course, and has household income at or below specified levels.The executive has advised that it disallowed an application by the person concerned for a back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance as her household income, including one-parent family payment and FÁS allowance, was above the limit for entitlement. The executive has notified her of this decision. The person concerned had not previously informed either the HSE or this Department of her full income. Consequently, she was overpaid rent supplement and one-parent family payment. These matters are now being examined by the Department and the HSE.

Since the scheme was first introduced, its primary focus has been towards people who most need additional training or qualifications to gain a foothold in the labour market. People with a primary degree are already in possession of a third level qualification and their academic qualifications should impact positively on their employment prospects. Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.The person concerned, who holds a primary degree in computer science, obtained in 2003, applied for participation in the back-to-education allowance scheme in order to pursue a further degree in social science. The application was refused on the grounds that the person concerned has already achieved a high level of academic attainment.When determining if exceptional circumstances pertain in similar cases, consideration is given to the length of time since the person obtained the first primary degree and the efforts made to find employment with the third level qualification already held. In this instance, a review of the decision was carried out but, following a re-examination of the case, the original decision was upheld.

Further action, including the application of any penalties, will depend on the outcome of these inquiries.If it is established that there was inappropriate access to records by a staff member, the case will be referred to the personnel officer for appropriate action under the Civil Service disciplinary code. I am satisfied that the matter can be dealt with adequately under the code.My Department views its obligations to safeguard the privacy of data under its control very seriously and has undertaken a considerable amount of work in this area over the past few years. It has also imposed sanctions where warranted up to and including dismissal, for the misuse of personal information.

The conditions for entitlement to the third level option of the back-to-education allowance scheme were revised with effect from 1 September 2004. From that date, the qualifying period was increased from six months to 15 months for new applicants intending to commence third level courses of study.As the Deputy is aware, I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme to 12 months in the last budget. I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from €254 to €400. These changes came into effect from 1 September 2005.Following an undertaking to the Dáil and the Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I have further reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option to nine months. This condition will apply to persons who are participating in the national employment action plan, NEAP, process and where a FÁS employment services officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individuals' employment prospects. This new condition also came into effect from 1 September 2005.The BTEA scheme was always intended to benefit people who had difficulty finding employment because of a lack of educational qualifications. In many cases, people who have not completed second level education are held back in their efforts to obtain employment because of this. The qualification period for people who wish to pursue second level education has remained at six months and the numbers taking second level education with the support of BTEA are increasing. Periods spent on FÁS training courses have always counted towards the qualifying period for access to the back-to-education allowance scheme.

The allowance also has a number of unique features attaching to it. It is payable for the duration of the course of study, which in some instances includes holiday periods. The scheme itself is not means tested and, consequently, participants may take up part-time employment without affecting their payment.In addition, participants receive a cost of education allowance of €400 which is payable at the beginning of each academic year. Participants also retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they had while in receipt of the relevant social welfare payment that qualified them for participation in the scheme, subject to a means test.The Department of Education and Science provide child care supports for people participating in certain educational programmes funded by VECs. In some cases, people accessing those programmes do so with the support of this Department's back to education allowance scheme. However, since its inception, child care support has never been a feature of the back to education allowance scheme per se. The question of such support to participants in receipt of the allowance would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other supports such as those funded by the Department of Education and Science.With regard to crèche supplements, these were introduced in some of the former health boards some years ago to provide individual assistance through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to parents wishing to use crèches in certain circumstances. This arose, for example, where a parent would not be able to avail of necessary supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes without assistance towards the cost of child-minding. They were never intended to be a long-term ongoing support for people returning to full-time education with the assistance of the back to education allowance.

Reviews of means-tested payments are also carried out by inspectors to ensure the conditions regarding entitlement continue to be satisfied. The inspectors' remit also includes the combating of fraud and abuse of all the Department's schemes.The inspectorate is also responsible for ensuring that employers and the self employed comply with the Acts in relation to pay related social insurance contributions. In addition, inspectors monitor employers' compliance with the Pensions Act 1990 in relation to PRSA obligations and notify the Pensions Board where non-compliance in this regard is suspected.Where a non-contributory pension is awarded there is a legal obligation on the recipient to report any increases in means to the Department within a period of three months. As for ongoing reviews of means-tested payments, a total of 2,140 reviews of old-age non-contributory pensions were carried out by inspectors in 2004.There is a total of 297 inspectors currently working countrywide with annual salaries ranging from €26,618 to €53,191, depending on grade and service. Inspector posts are advertised internally in the Department and are normally filled either by the transfer of the most experienced and suitable applicant or by internal competition.

This scheme and related supplements are administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive and neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to individual claim decisions.The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet, low cost or high cost, has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, as well as the income of the individual and his-her dependants.The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned has been prescribed a low cost diet, and applied to the health executive for a diet supplement. In accordance with the regulations governing the scheme, diet supplement is not payable in this case on means grounds. The person concerned does not qualify because the cost of the diet he has been prescribed is less than one third of his assessable income.

Regulations to provide for the roll-out of that system to a significant number of additional traffic and parking offences are currently being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána. This extension of the operation of the fixed charge system will include its application to illegal parking offences. The level of the fixed charge, which I will prescribe as soon as feasible, will be higher than the present level of €19. The operation of the fixed charge system is dependent on the development of a new computerised processing system for the Garda and the putting in place of administrative support services.

The restructuring of the State airports, including Shannon, is intended to enhance their regional focus and I am encouraged by the close co-operation between the new Shannon Airport Authority and the other regional development bodies in the area.Work underway in my Department on a ten-year transport investment framework will address the future infrastructural requirements of the mid-west region. As the Deputies will also be aware, the restructuring of the State airports, including Shannon, will be progressed in the light of the assessment in due course, by myself and the Minister for Finance, of the business plans which are currently under preparation by the three airport authorities.As I have stated in previous replies, the development of an EU-US open-skies regime provides many opportunities for Shannon Airport to contribute to the development of the mid-west. The liberalisation of the aviation market between the EU and US will mean more, not fewer, opportunities for Shannon to develop new routes into North America.Finally, it has been the consistent policy of this Government that any change in transatlantic arrangements will be accompanied by an appropriate transitional arrangement to enable a smooth phasing in of open skies with the US in the future.

Of this almost €349 million has been allocated to Dublin Bus. The subvention paid to Dublin Bus has increased from €17 million in 1999 to almost €65 million in 2005.The national development plan, NDP, target for buses in Dublin is 275 additional buses and 500 replacement buses. To date, Dublin Bus has purchased 497 new buses of which 93 are additional and 404 are replacement buses. A total of 248 of these buses were funded partially and-or fully by the Exchequer.Dublin Bus is carrying out a review of the bus network in Dublin to assess the impact of recent upgrades in rail capacity such as Luas and the DART upgrade and ongoing demographic changes.

I stated in answer to that question that the railway line between Heuston Station and Connolly Station is not used for commuter services because it would not be possible to accommodate additional peak train services into Connolly Station. The line between Connolly Station and Pearse Station is already at full capacity and any additional capacity created in the future will be needed to cater for DART and Maynooth line growth.If Iarnród Éireann were to provide services from Heuston Station to Connolly Station, it would require it to remove a corresponding number of services from the Maynooth, Drogheda or DART line. Obviously this is not an option given the already high demand for these services.Connections between Heuston Station and Connolly Station are provided by Luas services. Dublin Bus also provides a number of bus services from Heuston Station to the city centre, Connolly Station, St. Stephen's Green and Dublin Airport.

Tobin & Co. Limited for my Department, I approved a grant of €1.84 million to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cable car and associated services between Inis Bigil and Acaill at Béal an Bhulláin. This grant was based on a total estimated construction cost of €2.03 million with Mayo County Council to provide the balance of €190,000.While it was hoped that the cable car would be fully operational by spring 2003, there was a delay because of an objection lodged with An Bord Pleanála against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of land required for the project. While An Bord Pleanála subsequently confirmed the compulsory purchase order, this decision became the subject of an application for a High Court judicial review. As a result of a settlement between Mayo County Council and the landowner this application was withdrawn and subsequently Mayo County Council sought my Department's approval to proceed with the acquisition of land and the appointment of consultants to prepare contract documents for the project.In view of the time that had elapsed since this project was originally approved for funding, I decided late last year that it would be appropriate, in line with current guidelines and best practice for securing value for money for the Exchequer in respect of capital expenditure, to carry out a review of the 1999 report of the consultant engineers on the project. Consultants Malachy Walsh and partners in conjunction with McClure Watters were appointed by my Department to carry out this review.In their final report, the consultants concluded, inter alia, that the development of new piers on Inis Bigil and at Doran’s Point over the last number of years had satisfied a key departmental objective to provide safe access to Inis Bigil; and if the cable car project was to be progressed, it should only be done within the context of an integrated tourism development plan for the area, with the aim of maximising the tourism benefits of the project and other local tourist attractions. In the light of the latter conclusion and in view of the impending expiry of the time allowed for the issue of notices to treat in respect of the compulsory purchase orders on the land required for the project, Mayo County Council was authorised by me earlier this year to purchase the said land so that all realistic options for providing the cable car service could be usefully explored.In addition, my Department has engaged in discussions with both Ireland West Tourism and Mayo County Council with a view to ascertaining the tourism potential of the project, and is in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency and actively examining the feasibility of obtaining both public and private partners to build and operate the facility. The issue of whether to proceed with the preparation of contract documents for the project will be examined further on completion of this consultation process.

In the event of an underspend under any heading, the money is either re-allocated to other projects within the Vote or surrendered to the Exchequer. In the case of deferral, a further provision is re-entered in the Vote the following year. One of the functions of Waterways Ireland — a North-South implementation body established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 — is to examine the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal.A study was commissioned which estimated the cost of the restoration of the full Ulster Canal at approximately £90 million sterling based on 2000 costs. Matters arising as regards the project, including the question of whether a phased or partial approach might be feasible, remain under consideration by my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North. Any decision to proceed with the Ulster Canal would require both approval and funding from both jurisdictions.

In October 2004, Ireland submitted proposals for a derogation from the general organic nitrogen limit of 170 kg per hectare per annum laid down in the nitrates directive. The proposal was designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. My Department and Teagasc developed the derogation proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The European Commission was not prepared to engage in formal discussions on the derogation proposals until Ireland's nitrates action programme was agreed. There have been preliminary discussions with the Commission, however, and I will be pressing strongly to have these discussions concluded as early as possible in 2006.

I am hopeful that early approval of the scheme will be forthcoming so that it can be introduced next January. Subject to the required EU approval, the scheme will introduce a standard grant rate of 60%, with 70% being available for Zone C counties, in place of the current grant rate of 40% — additional aid will be available for young farmers at rates of 10% in less-favoured areas and 5% in other areas; extend the maximum ceiling for farmers from 450 to 650 income units, with no upper limit being applied in the case of pig and poultry farmers; raise the maximum eligible investment from €75,000 to €120,000; remove any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers can participate; extend the scheme to include horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost; introduce a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to maximum eligible investment of €80,000, in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs, and €40,000 in the case of specialized slurry spreading tankers and related equipment; and increase the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from €11,000 to €15,000 with the grant rate remaining at 20%.I am satisfied that, when approved, the revised scheme will provide a very satisfactory platform for Irish farmers who need to carry out additional investment works in order to meet the requirements of the nitrates directive.

Good Farming Practice states that farmers must keep documents such as invoices and delivery dockets showing the date, type and quantity of chemical fertilisers and organic materials brought onto or leaving the farm. The records farmers will be required to keep are set out in the national action programme submitted to the European Commission by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in July.With effect from 1 January 2006, farmers will be required to maintain records for each calendar year and to retain those records for a period of not less than five years. The type of records to be kept will include estimates of the annual fertiliser requirement for the holding, records of the quantities and formulations of chemical fertilisers used on the holding, including opening stock, records of purchase and closing stock, and records of livestock manure and other organic fertilisers moved into or off the holding including quantities, type, dates and details of the source or destination.Regulations giving effect to the action programme are being finalised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I expect them to be published shortly for public consultation. These regulations will specify the requirements for keeping records. My Department is preparing a guidance document designed to help farmers meet their obligations under the action programme and it will elaborate further on the record keeping aspect. As a way of providing practical help to farmers, my Department is also preparing to make available to them whatever relevant information is kept on its computer records.

The non-growing season varies throughout the country but as a general guide the code advised that land spreading should be avoided between the months of October and February.Good Farming Practice, published by my Department in 2001, set down the environmental requirements applicable to various schemes operated under EC Council Regulations 1257/99 and 1258/99. It is stated in Good Farming Practice that farmers should not spread slurry, dungstead manure or chemical nitrogen in the months of November and December. In light of the foregoing there is no justification for delaying the introduction of a prohibition on land spreading during the months of November and December in the nitrates action programme.

Throughout the discussions on the action programme, the European Commission took a firm position on the minimum storage capacity required for pig producers. It also insisted that such storage facilities must be put in place at the earliest possible date. The nitrates action programme submitted to the Commission on 29 July reflects those discussions and therefore states that the storage capacity required for pigs must be in place by 31 December 2006. The action programme requires that the minimum storage capacity for all other livestock, including poultry, must be in place by 31 December 2008.

A health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation must accompany poultry meat being imported from third countries. All consignments must first be landed at an approved border inspection post and undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. Once it has been established that the meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the Union. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.EU regulations also apply to poultry meat which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat. The regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled at retail level with the information regarding class, price per kg, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a third country, an indication of country of origin. The implementation of these regulations is monitored on a continual basis by Department staff.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	783	The draft regulations on veterinary medicines which were circulated by my Department in August for consultation are designed to give effect to EU Directive 2004/28 and to reform aspects of the existing national regime. I am aware of the views that have been expressed about the possible impact of the draft regulations on competition in the supply of veterinary medicines, in particular, from the requirement in the EU directive that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals must be subject to prescriptions. However, the directive also includes a provision for exemption criteria to be adopted at EU level, which will provide a mechanism for certain categories of medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement. The EU has not yet adopted a decision on the exemption criteria but must do so before 1 January 2007. Pending this decision, existing national prescription and distribution arrangements may remain in place.It is my intention to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible and my Department has made a submission to the European Commission with a view to retaining "off prescription" in Ireland all products, other than intramammaries, which currently enjoy this status. The draft regulations published by my Department provide that veterinary medicines, such as wormers and certain vaccines, will continue to be available off prescription for the time being and in practice this means that, apart from intramammaries, we are retaining the essence of our existing national prescription and distribution regime. In view of this, it is not necessary at this stage, for competition reasons, to extend the range of persons who may be permitted to prescribe. I will, however, review the regulations and in particular the provisions relating to the categories of persons who would be permitted to prescribe medicines in the light of the exemption criteria that are agreed at EU level in due course.

The structure of deer farming has altered over the past ten years. While the number of units has decreased from some 450 in 1994, the average enterprise has increased in scale with resulting growth in the farmed deer population in the past ten years. Although there are fewer enterprises now, they are larger, more specialised and moving towards quality assured high value product outlets. The development of a quality assured venison scheme has improved marketing potential, especially in supermarkets, and there are approximately 100 farms now quality assured. Wild venison from Scotland and farmed venison from New Zealand are the main competition for Irish farmed venison in Europe.

The area of potatoes grown fluctuated between 13,173 hectares in 2000 and 13,725 hectares in 2003. In 2004 the area fell by 8% to 12,604 hectares. Despite the reduced area, exceptionally high yields resulted in over-supply and depressed prices to producers. As 2004 was the second successive year of poor farm gate prices, it is estimated that the 2005 production area has fallen by a further 8% to 10% to 11,500 hectares. With yields in the region of 40 tonnes per hectare, the 2004 output amounted to 506,533 tonnes. As growing conditions this year were not as favourable, the pre-harvest indications are that yields will be in the region of 35 tonnes per hectare, giving a gross output of around 400,000 tonnes.

I am satisfied that the framework agreement secured the benefits to Irish farmers of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy and represented a satisfactory outcome from Ireland's point of view. The detailed implementation of the framework has been the subject of ongoing negotiation at technical and political level with the aim of concluding an agreement at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. My overriding objective is to ensure that the terms of the final agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.More specifically, my priorities are to ensure that the phasing-out of all forms of export subsidies will be applied in parallel, as provided for under the framework agreement, and that the phasing-out period will be as long as possible, that Ireland's agricultural exports will remain competitive in the EU market through the continuation of adequate levels of tariff protection on imports from third countries and that the EU's system of direct payments which, following decoupling, qualify as non-trade-distorting, continue to be exempt from reductions under the new agreement. These objectives are consistent with the Commission's negotiating mandate as agreed in the Council.

Following the introduction of the single payment scheme, the production of crops for energy purposes will, in common with all agricultural production in future, be demand-driven. Farmers will only produce crops for bioenergy if the economic returns are greater than those offered by more traditional uses. The production of liquid biofuels from energy crops is not economic at current oil price levels. However, the scheme for mineral oil tax relief on pilot biofuel projects recently announced by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, is important in stimulating the production of energy crops, as the current payment under the single payment scheme for that purpose in itself is insufficient. Teagasc, which has responsibility for the provision of research and advisory services for the agrifood sector, has done some very valuable work on energy crops. I am anxious to encourage further progress in this area and have arranged for research projects on biofuels and other non-food uses of crops to be included in the latest call under my Department's research stimulus programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	790	Promotion and marketing of Irish beef, lamb, pigmeat and chicken comes under the remit of Bord Bia. The key element of its strategy in the catering industry is to promote beef, lamb, pigmeat and chicken through its Féile Bia programme. This is a voluntary programme for hotels, restaurants, pubs and workplaces that was developed by Bord Bia in conjunction with the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation and is supported by the farming community. There are currently over 1,400 members drawn from the food service sector participating in the programme.While EU legislation does not permit the promotion of Irish origin products above those of other member state products, Féile Bia encourages the general public to think about how food is produced and where it comes from when eating out. Members of the programme source their products from suppliers approved under recognised quality assurance schemes. Products included in the programme are beef, lamb, pork, bacon, chicken and eggs. As an example of a Féile Bia promotion, Bord Bia is currently running a nationwide campaign to encourage the general public to choose Féile Bia outlets when eating out and know where their beef is coming from. Special prizes in Féile Bia hotels and guest houses are available. To support this autumn promotion, a nationwide advertising and publicity campaign is under way.For the future, the aim is to significantly increase the existing membership base of 1,400 and broaden the product range. Beef has the most developed system of labelling in the EU, with a full identification, traceability and labelling system under comprehensive EU regulations. The labelling requirements under those regulations extend up to and including retail level and to the point of delivery into hotels, restaurants and catering establishments. My priority in this area is to extend the existing beef labelling laws to require information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to all consumers in the restaurant and catering sectors. I put specific proposals to Government at the end of June for a legislative framework to facilitate this by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. This will be introduced under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005, which is before the Oireachtas this session. The appropriate regulations are being worked on concurrently and it is my intention to have these cleared at EU level as soon as possible. When the Act is amended and the regulations made, country of origin information will be available to consumers in respect of all beef served in restaurants, hotels and the whole catering sector in Ireland on a mandatory basis.In the meantime and after discussions with my Department, the various representative bodies, including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and both of the vintners groups, have all agreed to recommend to their members the introduction on a voluntary basis of a mechanism for providing consumers in their premises with information on the country of origin of the beef served there in advance of the mandatory legal requirement. This agreement was finalised last week and these organisations are currently at various stages of that process. I expect the voluntary system will be in place in the very near future. The next step in meat labelling is to extend the labelling requirements in law for poultrymeat, pigmeat and lamb in order to have similar provisions as those for beef. This is not a straightforward matter and will involve considerable complexities. EU approval would be required and there is no precedent so far for individual member states being allowed to extend meat labelling requirements internally beyond providing information that is already required in EU laws.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	792	I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 412 together.The marketing of Irish meats is carried out by the industry with support from my Department and Bord Bia. Bord Bia has specific responsibility for the promotion of Irish beef, lamb and pigmeat. That organisation is engaged in a wide range of activities to promote these meats on both foreign and domestic markets. In 2005, these activities include retail promotions of Irish beef across 8,000 stores representing 30 retailers in nine countries, the operation of the Chefs' Irish Beef Club in Britain, France and the Netherlands, the introduction of the quality assurance country of origin mark for beef to Irish retailers, a major trade mission to China led by the Taoiseach in which I also participated and during which I signed a protocol on the export of pigmeat to China, a joint programme with Enterprise Ireland to assist smaller pigmeat processors to develop their capabilities and secure market access in the United Kingdom and the retail promotion of Irish lamb in Ireland and France. In Ireland, the emphasis is on increasing lamb consumption whereas in France the emphasis is on making consumers aware of the availability and quality of Irish lamb.It is anticipated that exports of Irish beef this year will be slightly lower than last year's at approximately 494,000 tonnes. Beef production is extremely valuable to the Irish economy with a €1.4 billion export value representing almost 25% of total Irish agrifood exports. The majority of beef exports to date have been to the high value United Kingdom and EU markets. EU consumption is predicted to again outstrip production in 2005 with a resulting import gap of an estimated 280,000 tonnes for the year. This will provide further opportunities for our beef exports in the high value continental markets. Ireland is competing on the EU markets with beef imported from low cost South American economies, notably Brazil. The main concern is that Brazil has a capacity to significantly increase its exports, not only to Ireland but also to our main export outlets in Europe and in other third countries, in direct competition with us. The issue is one that continues to be monitored and is being considered in the context of our preparations for the World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong in December.Bord Bia has undertaken an autumn promotion of identified Irish Beef in conjunction with EU retailers and their Irish suppliers. This is being rolled out progressively across nine EU countries over the next two months. Initial feedback is encouraging in terms of improved demand in response to the promotion and it is hoped that we can strengthen the position of Irish beef in the European marketplace. An increased presence in this sophisticated, high value market is the key to the success of the beef industry in the long term.The value of Irish lamb exports increased by approximately 14% to €165 million in 2004. While the main market is France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Denmark are growing in importance. The Tunisian and Algerian markets were also opened in 2004 and all markets showed increased trade that year. Trade with the United Kingdom increased by some 19% in 2004 while the important French market, which accounts for about two thirds of all lamb exports, increased by approximately 14% despite strong competition from the United Kingdom and New Zealand.The outlook for Irish pigmeat exports this year looks stable and should be in line with the export figure of 117,000 tonnes for 2004. Just over half of our pigmeat exports go to the United Kingdom with the remainder equally divided between other EU member states and third countries. Poultrymeat export volumes in 2004 realised some 93,000 tonnes and were valued at in excess of €230 million. This figure includes our valuable industry processed products and prepared meats area. The outlook for 2005 is for our markets to remain stable. I am satisfied that the promotion efforts of Bord Bia play an important role both in maintaining our existing markets for beef, lamb and pigmeat and also in developing new ones for the future.

It is also a requirement under the new European food safety legislation, which came into effect at the beginning of this year, that all food businesses must have a traceability system in place. This new legislation places the responsibility for compliance with food safety legislation on the all food business operators along the food chain, that is from the primary producer right through to the final outlet. It requires, among other points, that each such operator must be able to trace and record details of the supplier of the food product to the customer, covering both one step back and one step forward along the food chain.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	794	There is some legislation governing the labelling of meat and meat products. The general labelling regulations covering, among other points, all food sold in Ireland require that the information be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer. This legislation comes within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. My Department is responsible for policy in respect of legislation on the labelling of specific products including beef and other meats. The labelling of beef is governed by EU regulations that were introduced in 2000. These compulsory labelling regulations require all operators and organisations marketing beef within the community to provide the information on the label, namely, a reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived, the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located, the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived to include the country in which it was born and reared.These requirements apply to all beef sold at retail level regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country and all the above details are not available, that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as "Origin: non-EC" along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place. For the purpose of these regulations, marketing means all aspects of beef production and marketing to retail level, including up to the point of delivery into hotels, restaurants and catering establishments.My priority now in this area is to extend the existing beef labelling laws to require information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to all consumers in the restaurant and catering sectors. I put specific proposals to Government at the end of June for a legislative framework to facilitate this by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. This will be introduced under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005, which is before the Oireachtas this session. The appropriate regulations are being worked on concurrently and it is my intention to have these cleared at EU level as soon as possible. When the Act is amended and the regulations made, country of origin information will be available to consumers in respect of all beef served in restaurants, hotels and the whole catering sector in Ireland on a mandatory basis.In the meantime and following discussions with my Department, the various representative bodies, including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and both of the vintners groups, have all agreed to recommend to their members the introduction on a voluntary basis of a mechanism for providing consumers in their premises with information on the country of origin of the beef served there in advance of the mandatory legal requirement. This agreement was finalised last week and these organisations are currently at various stages in that process. I expect the voluntary system will be in place in the very near future.Beef has the most developed system of labelling in the EU. However, there are also EU regulations on poultrymeat that provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultrymeat. The regulations require such poultrymeat to be labelled at retail level with the information regarding class, price per kilogram, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a third country, an indication of country of origin. My next step in meat labelling is to extend the labelling requirements to have similar provisions in law for poultrymeat, pigmeat and lamb as we will have for beef. This is not a straightforward matter and will involve considerable complexities. EU approval will also be required and there is no precedent so far for individual member states being allowed to extend meat labelling requirements internally beyond providing information that is already required in EU laws.Arising from the implementation of the recommendations of the food labelling group, responsibility for the enforcement of all food labelling legislation is now centralised with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. On the food labelling issue in general, I must emphasise that my primary aim is to protect consumer interest and to ensure that the consumer is properly informed. Ireland is a major exporter of food and food products and indeed there are also considerable imports. Therefore, it is imperative that the same standards are applied to the labelling of foods in every sector and that there is a level playing field for the food industry at all levels. In this context, my Department has pursued assiduously the implementation in as full a manner as possible of the recommendations of the food labelling group. At a meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 28 February this year, I raised again the issue of labelling of foodstuffs and I, along with a number of member states, asked the Commission to further examine how best food labelling should be handled at EU level in order to best protect the interests of the consumer.

Having given full consideration to the matter, the visas were refused because my Department was not satisfied that the applicants would fully honour the conditions of the visa. It was felt that the applicants had not displayed evidence of their obligations to return home following the proposed visit. The applications were refused on 7 September as the visa officer could not be reasonably satisfied that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visa.The onus is on the applicant to provide sufficient documentation to enable both the initial application and, where applicable, an appeal to be fully examined. In this case, it was deemed that the evidence provided by the applicants at appeal stage did not warrant a reversal of the initial decision to refuse the application. Consequently, the decision to decline the grant of a visa to the applicants was upheld on 29 October 2004. It is open to the applicants to make a fresh application with up-to-date supporting documentation and the matter will be considered anew.

The amount approved was considered to be a sufficient contribution for the level of service being provided.I understand from inquiries I have made with Area Development Management Limited, ADM, which is engaged by my Department to carry out the day-to-day administration of the EOCP, that the group has drawn down €38,100 of the staffing grant to date. At the current rate of spend, the group is assured funding until December 2005.Following a detailed review of the existing staffing grants under the EOCP, my Department recently extended the terms of the grants to the end of December 2007 to groups which have received staffing grants for a period of three or more years and which continue to deliver a child care service in accordance with their pre-agreed targets. To benefit from such funding, the groups must continue to pay particular attention to the support of disadvantaged families and the implementation of a fee structure tailored to the differing economic circumstances of the client group and which ensures that child care places subsidised by the EOCP are targeted towards those most in need.I understand from inquiries I have made to ADM that the group in question is currently providing a lower level of service than that originally committed to and for which the grant was approved. I further understand that ADM is in dialogue with the group and is carrying out a full review of the extent to which the service is meeting the objectives of the EOCP, with particular reference to the key objectives to meet the needs of parents in employment, training or education. When the review is completed, a decision will be made regarding future funding for the group in question. The group will be informed of the outcome of the review in due course.

Unfortunately, the level of income in this case demonstrated that the person is not in a position to support the spouse without recourse to public funds and my Department is therefore not in a position to grant the visa at this time.To date my Department has not received an appeal from the applicant. The appeal must be submitted to the visa appeals officer within two months of the refusal date which was 15 August. Therefore the deadline for lodging the appeal would be 15 October. Any appeal should be accompanied by additional documentation designed to address the reason for refusal outlined above.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that all applications for such Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and must receive their full support. The application is then considered by the CCTV advisory committee which makes a recommendation, through the Garda Commissioner, to myself. Applications are assessed by the committee on the basis of Garda operational needs against the following objective criteria: crime-public order statistics in an area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances or needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on the area. I am further informed that the Garda authorities have no plans to alter the criteria currently in place. The deployment and allocation of resources, including Garda CCTV systems, is an operational matter for the Garda authorities.I am advised that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Thurles from local Garda management and Thurles chamber of commerce, which had been submitted to the CCTV advisory committee for consideration, was withdrawn in early 2003. Further to a number of queries received regarding this application, officials in my Department were advised by the Garda authorities that the application was withdrawn as the chamber of commerce intended to install a community based CCTV system. I am advised that no new application for a Garda CCTV system in Thurles has since been received by the advisory committee. I am further informed that no application for the installation of a Garda CCTV system in Nenagh has ever been submitted to the CCTV advisory committee for consideration.The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the Garda Síochána to install Garda CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. To this end, I launched the community based CCTV scheme on 15 June 2005. This scheme has been developed in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems. The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. Communities which are not ready to apply for full scheme funding — stage 2 — could apply for pre-development supports — stage 1 — to assist in the formulation of high-quality proposals which will have the necessary elements of local support and sustainability.The closing date for receipt of applications was 20 September 2005 and the scheme is being administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management Limited, ADM. I am advised that four of the 83 applications for funding under both stages of the scheme originated from County Tipperary. I understand that an application for stage 2 funding has been received from Thurles and is under consideration. No application for either stage has been received from Nenagh.

The personnel strength of Dungarvan Garda station as at 31 December 1997 was 28, all ranks. This represents an increase of seven, or 25%, in the number of personnel allocated to Dungarvan Garda station since that date.I am further advised that the numbers of Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public. However, the situation will be kept under review and the policing needs of Dungarvan will continue to be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda districts and divisions throughout the country.With regard to Garda resources generally, I am, of course, very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

This programme is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: phase 1, Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; phase 2, Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; phase 3, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. Phase 1 has been completed in five of the six locations.Installation of CCTV systems is a detailed, complex and lengthy process. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the CCTV programme, and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to submit proposals for outsourced CCTV systems in the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations, including Clondalkin, by the end of 2006.As a first step in this process the Garda authorities engaged a consultancy firm to examine all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including the installation, operation and management of CCTV systems; monitoring, recording and related activities; accommodation and situation of facilities and staff in respect of the town CCTV system and Garda station premises; and assessment of civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda Síochána.The consultancy firm also examined which procurement model is the most suitable in terms of commercial viability and cost effectiveness for the provision of town centre CCTV systems. This consultancy process has recently concluded and the Garda authorities are finalising their proposals in consultation with my Department.

Since then the Garda mountain bike unit has been expanded on a national basis.The total number of mountain bikes available to the Garda Síochána is 95 of which two are allocated to Clondalkin and two to Ronanstown Garda stations. The further allocation of Garda mountain bikes to additional Garda districts will take place each year over the next three years and that the allocation of Garda mountain bikes to Lucan Garda station is receiving consideration in line with several other Garda districts nationally.Mountain bike units have been very successful in tackling anti-social disorderly behaviour in local parks and estates and work well in conjunction with other units. Overall, the units have proved successful to date due to their commitment, ability to respond quickly and effectively and capacity to provide a high visibility presence.Mountain bike units have made a significant and positive contribution to a proactive approach in tackling crime. Garda management has received positive feedback from the community about the work of these units.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.A notification under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act 1999 issued to the person concerned on 5 August 2005 advising her of the decision to refuse to give her a declaration of refugee status and setting out the options open to her at that point namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons she should not be deported.Her case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement), including consideration of all representations received on her behalf. Deportation orders were made in respect of her and her two children on 15 September 2005. Notice of these orders was served on her by registered post. The letter made her aware of the requirement to present herself and her two children to the Garda national immigration bureau on Thursday 29 September 2005 to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. She is due to present to the bureau again on Thursday 13 October 2005. The enforcement of these deportation orders remains a matter for the bureau.

In this regard, the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement payment is used. The criteria, which may change from time to time, are available on that Department's website www.welfare.ie/publications/sw22.htm.In this case the evidence supplied was not sufficient to enable the visa officer to conclude that the individual in question had adequate funds available to enable them live in the State without recourse to public funds. The application was refused as it was deemed that the Irish citizen was unable to support her husband due to her full-time student status.An appeal of the decision to refuse the visa application was subsequently submitted. However, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently the application was refused on appeal.

By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations. The number of projects has grown from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The locations of new projects are decided upon by the Garda authorities in conjunction with my Department. There are currently three Garda youth diversion projects, KEY, JAY and YEW, operating in the Tallaght area, which collectively cater for 134 participants.I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects. Proposals made by the Garda Síochána to my Department on establishing further projects are examined within the context of available resources. All applications relating to the establishment of further projects should follow the establishment process as set out in the Garda youth diversion project guidelines, which I launched in 2003. The 11 establishment guidelines give a clear structure to the application process, from the initial expression of interest to the final submission of the proposal, and cover issues such as the pre-establishment phase, consultation, memorandum of understanding, legal structure, the co-ordinator's job description and the catchment area.A budget of €5.471 million has been provided for the Garda youth diversion projects and local drugs task force projects in 2005. That amount will be required to meet the funding needs of the projects in operation. It is not envisaged that additional youth diversion projects will be established in the short term. I am committed to seeking additional funding for projects in the context of prevailing budgetary conditions, and in that context the application for the project referred to by the Deputy will be kept under review.

The personnel strength of Tallaght Garda station at 31 December 1997 was 133, all ranks. That represents an increase of 40, or 30%, in the number of personnel allocated to Tallaght Garda station since that date. Local Garda management report that those resources are further augmented by the divisional crime task force based at Crumlin Garda station, the divisional traffic unit based at Terenure Garda station, and the national support units such as the Garda dog unit, the air support unit, and the mounted unit.I am further advised that local Garda management is satisfied that the resources currently attached to Tallaght Garda station are sufficient to police the Tallaght sub-district. However, the situation will be kept under review, and the policing needs of Tallaght will continue to be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda districts and divisions throughout the country.Regarding Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the Agreed Programme for Government commitment in that regard. That is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties very significantly as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing that I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

As I indicated when I appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 7 September last, I expect, subject to Government approval, to introduce these proposals as Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is awaiting completion of Second Stage in the Dáil.My amendments will allow the Garda to apply to the courts by way of civil procedure for an anti-social behaviour order, which will prohibit the person who is the subject of the order from behaving in an anti-social way. The orders will be civil orders and the question of an offence will arise only if a person in question wilfully defies the order and continues to engage in the behaviour.In framing my proposals, I have taken into account many of the issues raised in the public debate on the subject, as well as drawing on the experience in the UK in recent years. My proposals will incorporate important safeguards to ensure that the orders can be used for the benefit of the community as a whole rather than, for example, as a means of settling disputes between neighbours. My amendments will ensure that an application for an anti-social behaviour order will be a last resort in situations where other steps, including Garda warnings to desist, have been ignored. I will propose that an order may last for up to two years.To ensure that the new procedure is not open to abuse by anyone pursuing personal or other motives, I propose to provide that an application to the court for an anti-social behaviour order may be made only by a garda of senior rank and to include provision for the drawing up of Garda guidelines on the appropriate use of anti-social behaviour orders. I also propose to make provision in the legislation for guidelines for the courts on their intended use.I am aware of particular concerns which have been expressed regarding the application of anti-social behaviour orders to children. In that regard, I will propose that separate provisions should apply to adults and children. The provisions regarding children will be fully integrated into the Children Act 2001 and will attract all the protections of that Act. For example, other means of diverting children away from that type of behaviour must first be tried before an application for an anti-social behaviour order is made. My colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, is finalising the proposals regarding children, and it is intended that those too will be introduced as amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill.It will be clear that my proposals will provide for the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders in a manner which is both balanced and effective in dealing with those engaged in anti-social behaviour. It is my intention to bring my proposals to the Government in the coming weeks and, subject to Government approval, to make them available generally.

The personnel strength, all ranks, of that division at 3 October 2005 was 318. That represents an increase of 21 or 7.07%, in the number of personnel allocated to the Tipperary division since that date. It is the responsibility of the Garda divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division. I am further advised that, as town boundaries do not correlate with Garda sub-district boundaries, the information sought by the Deputy regarding the number of gardaí per thousand population cannot be provided.Local Garda management reports that resources are augmented from within the division or districts as required. All areas of the division are actively patrolled by district detective units and the divisional traffic unit.Regarding Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the Agreed Programme for Government commitment in that regard. That is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage those additional resources. In that context, the needs of each Garda district within the Tipperary region will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government.

Finance for Garda CCTV systems is allocated each year in the Estimates process, with the amount sought being based on current and planned Garda projects.Some 17 priority locations nationwide have been selected to receive a Garda CCTV system. This programme of implementation of CCTV systems is being implemented on a phased basis. The first phase includes Bray, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; the second includes Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; and the third comprises Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo.Installation of CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the CCTV programme, and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. The answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to submit proposals for outsourced CCTV systems in the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006.As a first step in this process, the Garda authorities engaged a consultancy firm to examine all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including the installation, operation and management of CCTV systems; monitoring, recording and related activities; accommodation and situation of facilities and staff in regard to the town CCTV system and Garda station premises; and assessment of civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda Síochána.The consultancy firm also examined which procurement model is the most suitable in terms of commercial viability and cost effectiveness for the provision of town centre CCTV systems. This consultancy process has recently concluded and the Garda authorities are now finalising their proposals in consultation with my Department.I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Mullingar has been received and is under consideration by the advisory committee, along with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country. The inclusion of other town centre locations, including Mullingar, beyond the 17 already listed in the programme of Garda CCTV systems will be considered in the context of the revised procurement model.The Deputy appreciates it is not possible for the Garda Síochána to install Garda CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. To this end, I launched the community based CCTV scheme on 15 June 2005. This scheme has been developed in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities for the provision of CCTV systems. The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. Communities which are not ready to apply for full scheme funding, stage two, may apply for pre-development supports, stage one, to assist in the formulation of high-quality proposals that have the necessary elements of local support and sustainability.The closing date for receipt of applications was 20 September 2005 and the scheme is being administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management Limited, ADM. I am informed by ADM that a total of 83 applications for funding under the community based CCTV scheme — 51 under stage one and 32 under stage two — were received by the closing date of 20 September 2005. An application for stage one funding has been received in respect of Mullingar and is under consideration.

In 2004 more than 130,000 non-EEA nationals registered with the Garda national immigration bureau and received such permission. These included work permit holders and their families, students, spouses of Irish nationals and dependants of EEA nationals.In the case of persons in the State without this permission, including failed asylum seekers, the issue of granting permission to remain is considered in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport them. Cases are examined on an individual basis under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement. The discussion document, Immigration and Residence in Ireland, which I published last April, included proposals for a single procedure for protection and a streamlined removals process. Proposals in this regard will be included in the immigration and residence Bill which is being prepared in my Department.

As the Deputy is aware, last February I published a fireworks policy consultation document and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the 1875 Act. My Department has received and is examining a wide range of submissions in response to the consultation document.It is already clear from the submissions received that, among the options for change outlined in the consultation document, there is a general acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the 1875 Act. Accordingly, I propose to take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, to bring forward, on Committee Stage, amendments to provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. I also propose to significantly increase penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.The Garda authorities make every effort to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of all types of fireworks. Where necessary, specific policing plans are put in place in areas where particular problems arise. These plans include intelligence gathering on known dealers and suppliers and, once identified, putting plans in place to arrest them and seize their stocks of illegal fireworks.Each year leading up to Hallowe'en, special efforts are made to combat the illegal importation of fireworks. This year an intelligence-led operation called Operation Tombola, which aims to prevent and detect the organised importation, for sale, of fireworks, has been put in place by the Garda Commissioner. In this context, chief superintendents throughout the country have been instructed to introduce measures appropriate to their respective areas of responsibility, with particular emphasis on Garda divisions in the Dublin metropolitan region and in Border regions. The operation, while intelligence driven, will be coupled with sporadic high-visibility policing activities.

The plan involves mentoring and group training for parents to improve their skills, esteem and aspirations for their children. It is intended that the project will result in improved physical and psychological health and better educational outcomes for children at key stages in their development to the point of reception in school.Officials of my Department have met with the education co-ordinator of the organisation in question on a number of occasions and have provided advice in regard to the development of the proposal. I understand it will shortly be presented formally to my Department and, at that stage, will be assessed in terms of our programmes to address educational disadvantage.

In this context, my Department provides home tuition grants in respect of pupils who cannot attend school at all, or who are absent for a significant proportion of the school year. My Department also sanctions home tuition in cases where children are awaiting a suitable school placement. However, I stress that home tuition is only intended as an interim measure and not as a replacement or substitute for school-based provision, which is the most appropriate intervention for pupils with special educational needs.In regard to the person referred to by the Deputy, I confirm that an application for home tuition was received in my Department for the continuation of the home tuition grant for the current school year. I understand a meeting is being arranged with the education welfare officer, EWO, the pupil's parents and an educational psychologist.

Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible. The treatment of SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as post office savings bonds.

The commission now has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. This includes the matter raised by the Deputy. I have forwarded his question to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I confirm for the Deputy that my Department has received an application from the service provider in question for funding towards the operation of its service. The proposal concerns the provision of educational services for a number of pre-school age pupils attending the service, including the child referred to by the Deputy. The proposal is under consideration in my Department and further contact will be made with the service provider as quickly as possible.In the interim, my Department has sanctioned five hours' home tuition per week for the child in question with effect from 1 September 2005. This decision was conveyed to the family on 22 July 2005. I wish to remind the Deputy that the provision of health care and therapeutic services remains the responsibility of the appropriate health authorities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	848	I propose to take Questions Nos. 469 and 470 together.As the Deputy is aware, my Department announced the new general allocation system last May with a view to it being implemented in all primary schools with effect from the start of the current school year. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, such as hearing impairment, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.In the intervening months, my officials have dealt with a significant level of queries in relation to the operation of the system in the form of both telephone calls and written correspondence. Their experience has been that while initial concerns were expressed by some schools as to the possible impact of the new model, these concerns were largely as a result of schools requiring further clarity in relation to their own particular situation. I add that this is not surprising given that the change from the previous allocation system to the general allocation system was indeed a major change and it was inevitable that schools would have a large number of queries as to how the new system would operate.At this stage my officials are confident that initial difficulties that were experienced by some schools in relation to issues such as clustering arrangements and the creation of full-time posts by combining general allocation hours and low incidence hours have been resolved in the vast majority of cases. In many of these cases it was possible to adjust the clustering arrangements to rectify geographical difficulties or to sanction additional teaching posts where the number of hours allocated to the school warranted such posts.Furthermore, my Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.In introducing the general allocation system I also introduced transitional arrangements whereby transitional hours would be given to schools to cater for children that had previously been allocated individual teaching resources but which it would not be possible for the school to provide under their allocation under the general allocation model. In the circumstances no child should have experienced a loss of resource teaching hours.As outlined in the circular it is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The type of response needed depends on the child. I am satisfied at this stage that the general allocation system is working well and has been generally favourably received by schools. My Department will continue to work with schools and the education partners with a view to ensuring that this remains the case going forward.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	849	There are 402 teachers with restricted recognition currently working in primary schools. My Department does not have information on the number of such teachers outside primary schools. Restricted recognition gives eligibility to teach in certain categories of special schools and in categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement. Teachers with such recognition are also entitled to take up positions in special schools for young offenders, youth encounter projects and special education projects.My Department grants restricted recognition to teachers who trained outside the State with a recognised primary teacher qualification, and teachers with certain approved Montessori. My Department also grants restricted recognition to teachers with a recognised post-primary qualification to enable them to teach in a special school where a proportion of pupils attending the special school are of post-primary age and where second level programmes are being provided by the school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	850	The level of funding that my Department provides to Educate Together schools is on a par with that provided to other primary schools. However, following discussions with Educate Together my Department has provided additional funding in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.In relation to support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, it should be noted that my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage, 11 of which are open.My Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation at a much faster rate, such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	851	I propose to take Questions Nos. 473 and 474 together.My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-1979 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools toward the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme is flexible in nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The standard rate of grant applicable under this scheme is €133 per pupil. The amount of grant paid to an individual school that does not have a full-time secretary or caretaker under the 1978-1979 scheme is determined by the number of pupils enrolled in the school, subject to a minimum grant of €7,980 being paid in the case of a school with an enrolment of 60 pupils or less and a maximum grant of €66,500 being paid in the case of a school with an enrolment of 500 or more pupils. However, if a school has a full-time secretary but no caretaker under the 1978-1979 scheme, or vice versa, the school is entitled to receive additional grant assistance in respect of caretaking or secretarial services only, as appropriate. The school concerned receives a payment of €66.50 per pupil, the corresponding minimum grant being €3,990 and the maximum being €33,250.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	852	I propose to take Questions Nos. 475 to 478, inclusive, 480 and 481 together.As the Deputy is aware, my Department announced the new general allocation system last May with a view to it being implemented in all primary schools with effect from the start of the current school year. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and learning support needs.

In many of these cases it was possible to adjust the clustering arrangements to rectify geographical difficulties or to sanction additional teaching posts where the number of hours allocated to the school warranted such posts.A comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, was issued to schools in September 2005 in relation to the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support. Schools are advised in the circular to establish a staged approach to assessment, identification and learning programme planning for pupils with special educational needs. This advice is in keeping with advice that has been provided to schools in previous circulars and in the learning support guidelines and the NEPS model of service. A staged approach to identification and intervention is also advocated in the report of the task force on dyslexia and is in keeping with the terms of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.Guidance for schools is provided in the circular for each step of the staged process. Three worked examples of how the staged can be put into operation in different school settings are provided. It is not advocated that schools should establish a uniform system of screening, identification and diagnostic testing in relation to the selection of pupils for additional support. Rather they should use the guidance in the documents that have been provided to develop policies and procedures to suit the circumstances of the school and the needs of the pupils. Further guidance and advice in relation to the establishment of whole-school procedures can be sought from NEPS by schools who have an assigned NEPS psychologist and from the primary curriculum support programme trainers who provide in-service support for all schools on the implementation of the learning support guidelines.I am also satisfied that, on the basis of the information that has been provided to schools, and with the assistance that is available to schools from the Department, the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Service, there is no confusion amongst principals and teachers regarding the definitions of high incidence and low incidence special needs.Furthermore, as indicated above, my Department has received and continues to receive feedback from schools on the general allocation system through telephone calls and written correspondence. My officials also engage on an ongoing basis with the education partners in relation to all aspects of the education system, including the general allocation system. I am satisfied that through these avenues there is ample opportunity for feedback on the general allocation system.As indicated in the circular that has issued to schools, the general allocation system will be reviewed within the next three years. The format of this review and whether a survey or questionnaire of schools will take place has not yet been decided upon. However, the position of disadvantaged schools may be reviewed at an earlier stage in the context of the development of a new policy framework for educational inclusion.I am satisfied that at this stage the general allocation system is working well and has been favourably received by schools. My Department will continue to work with schools and the education partners with a view to ensuring that this remains the case going forward.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	853	As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, my Department is currently engaged in a process to provide broadband Internet connectivity to all recognised first and second level schools with security, content filtering and other services routed through a national broadband network for schools. The scheme will receive industry support through an agreement with the Telecommunications and Internet Federation to the tune of some €15 million over the next three years with the estimated remaining €15 million being provided from Exchequer sources.Following a public tendering process contracts have been awarded to six firms for the provision of access connectivity across the nearly 4,000 schools involved and to a further company for the provision of a broadband router at school level. Currently the roll-out process is underway and a significant number of schools have already had basic connectivity service installed. The installation of routers has also commenced and it is envisaged that this process will be completed by or before March 2006.The provision of broadband connectivity is but one element of my Department's ongoing initiative in the integration of ICT into teaching and learning. Another specific priority relates to the development of computer networking facilities within schools and to this end, since December last, my Department has provided funding currently totalling some €20 million to some 3,600 schools based upon proposals submitted in this regard. My Department is currently considering the options and needs for the furtherance of the ICT initiative in schools in the context of an on-going census of school ICT infrastructure. This will inform future resource allocation in the area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	854	The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. Since 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs.Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support or special needs assistant support for the pupil. My officials have been advised by the NCSE that the application for special educational needs support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy is under consideration by the SENO and a decision will be given shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	855	At the request of my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has carried out a feasibility study on the teaching of modern languages in the primary curriculum. The report, completed last year, recommended that any decision on the place of modern languages in the primary curriculum should be deferred until the revised primary curriculum has been implemented in full. This will be 2007 at the earliest. Until then, the initiative will continue with support provided by a team of language specialists and funded by my Department. Also, the NCCA is engaging in additional research and some pilot projects with initiative schools to further inform its advice when the primary curriculum has been fully implemented.My Department is working closely with language experts from the Council of Europe to facilitate the analysis of language practice at primary and post-primary level, with a view to the formulation of an integrated language policy. This analysis will include Irish as well as the development of criteria for decision-making on issues such as the inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum. This will complement ongoing work by the NCCA, which is engaged in reviewing languages in the post-primary curriculum and the feasibility of expanding provision at primary level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	856	I am conscious of the fact that Lucan is one of the fastest growing areas in the country. In light of this, my Department has expanded capacity significantly at both primary and post-primary level to cater for existing and newly emerging demands for pupil places. With regard to post-primary capacity specifically, a new school for Coláiste Cois Life is currently under construction. This will provide places for 600 pupils, some 400 additional places relative to existing capacity. In addition to this, capacity at Coláiste Phádraig has been increased by 300 pupil places with the completion of a major extension project at that school. A further extension project at St. Joseph's College to provide an overall capacity of 725 pupil places has also been completed. This is deemed sufficient to meet demand from pupils in its catchment area.The Deputy will probably be aware that there is considerable vacant capacity at post-primary level in areas adjacent to Lucan. Given that it is practice, particularly in Dublin, for post-primary students to travel some distance to attend a post-primary school, it is not unreasonable that my Department should seek to optimise the use of existing surplus capacity at post-primary schools in the general vicinity of Lucan as part of its strategy to address any shortfall for post- primary places that may emerge. This is its intention. In addition to this, as I announced last week, a brand new post-primary school will be built at Adamstown under the public private partnership initiative to meet the needs of that particular area as it develops. My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Lucan to ensure that any future emerging needs are addressed in a timely manner.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	857	The home-school-community liaison scheme is one of my Department's main programmes for promoting educational inclusion. Home-school-community liaison services will have a central role in the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, or delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched on 30 May. The new action plan, which will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second-level education, or three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of some €40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis processes are being managed by the ERC on behalf of my Department. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban or town and 300 rural, and 150 second-level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters or communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. As part of the new school support programme, home-school-community liaison services will be extended to all of the 300 urban primary schools and 150 second-level schools in the SSP that are not already participating in the scheme. Access to teacher or coordinator support will also be made available to rural schools in the SSP that do not already have access to such a service. We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools on the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.

The matter of how best this additional accommodation should be provided, having regard to existing accommodation and the alternative options available, is currently under consideration. A decision in this regard will be made as soon as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	859	Prior to 2002 there were eight primary school providers in the Lucan area. In recognition of the developing nature of Lucan, my Department subsequently recognised three new primary new schools to cater for the growing demand for pupil places: an Educate Together school, a Catholic primary school under a reconfiguration process and a Gaelscoil. During the period in question, three new 16 classroom facilities have been built and plans are being advanced to extend an existing Gaelscoil to 16 classrooms also.The following table sets out the number of junior infant places offered in Lucan in the years 2002 to 2004, inclusive, together with the combined overall enrolments for the schools in question. All schools throughout the country are in the process of filing enrolment returns for the current school year.

The school authorities may liaise with the local authority on the issues outlined by the Deputy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	861	The criteria for eligibility under the free fees initiative includes the provision that tuition fees will not be paid in respect of students undertaking repeat years or in respect of students repeating a year-level having changed, but not completed, their undergraduate course. Tuition fees will, however, be paid in respect of students who, having attended but not completed an approved course, are returning following a break of at least five years in order to pursue an approved course at the same level in the 2005 to 2006 academic year. There is no age limit for eligibility under the free fees initiative.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	862	I understand that the candidate referred to by the Deputy previously completed more than the first year of a two-year national certificate course at Athlone IT and now has commenced a three-year ordinary degree, or national diploma, in the 2005-06 academic year at DIT. Grant assistance in respect of approved higher certificate and ordinary degree courses is awarded to eligible candidates under the terms and conditions prescribed in my Department's third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, TLT. In general the position on tenure of grants under the TLT scheme is that a grant holder may only receive funding for the approved duration of one third level training course. Nothwithstanding this condition the scheme does, however, provide for progression in specific circumstances where, for example, a candidate who has completed a two-year higher certificate course progresses to the add-on year of a directly related ordinary degree course.Another exception where grant assistance may be extended in respect of a subsequent TLT course would be where, following completion of a two-year higher certificate course, a candidate gets an exemption into year two of an indirectly related ordinary degree course. Funding may also be extended where trainees have passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course subsequently transfer to a different course. Such a candidate is eligible for a grant in respect of the normal duration of the new course subject to a maximum duration of four years in all. As the candidate in question has completed more than the first year of an approved TLT course he is ineligible for funding in respect of his current ordinary degree course. However, if the candidate progress to an honours degree course his eligibility for financial assistance may be considered.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	863	One of the main objectives of my Department's school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school, and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.As a general rule, special transport services are not established in areas where public scheduled bus services already exist. Eligible pupils in such cases are, however, facilitated with travel permits for public scheduled services.Bus Éireann, which administers the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, was previously asked to submit reports to my Department in respect of the transport arrangements for pupils from the Celbridge area attending Gaelscoil Uí Fhiaich, Maynooth. In its response, Bus Éireann reported that a good public scheduled service exists between Celbridge and Maynooth, and that the use of the service by younger pupils would be on the basis of the general arrangements in place for pupils availing of public scheduled services in the greater Dublin area.In view of the particular safety concerns outlined, however, my Department has requested Bus Éireann for an up-to-date report on the position.

However, there are no plans at present for the provision of additional second level places in the vicinity of the school to which the Deputy refers as I am satisfied that there is overall capacity in the general area to meet the need for post primary places.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	865	The trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers informed my Department in October 2004 of their intention to close due to falling enrolments.My Department's main role in a school closure is to ensure that the best interests of the pupils are looked after in the period up to the closure and that there will be sufficient pupil places in existing schools in the general area for pupils who would have normally enrolled in the closing school. To this end, contact has been made with the schools concerned and, on foot of this contact, I am satisfied there is ample capacity to cater for students who would otherwise have attended the school to which the Deputy refers.In addition to this, officials in my Department met with a parents' representative group in December 2004 to discuss the issue of the school's closure.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	866	I presume the Deputy is referring to an application for a place on a post-graduate programme for primary teacher training that is provided by a private college.The college referred to by the Deputy is a privately-owned institution providing a privately-run course which has been accredited by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC. In order for the course to secure HETAC accreditation, the college in question complied with HETAC's quality assurance and validation requirements. The graduate diploma conferred at the end of this course is recognised by my Department for the purposes of primary teaching.It is imperative that participants applying for the course meet the required criteria, which are common to all colleges of education that provide teacher training. Individual colleges have the responsibility of ensuring that these criteria are met by the applicants and that no exception is made in any individual case. Therefore, I do not have a function in the selection process and cannot intervene in this, or any individual case.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	867	I propose to take Questions Nos. 495 and 496 together.The recommendations in the N4-M4 area development plan will form a vital framework in which future decisions about school planning in this area will be made. Progress on individual recommendations will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards subject to the prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.The N4-M4 area development plan is one of five plans being carried out by my Department under a pilot scheme. When the pilot has been completed with the publication of the draft plan for the north Dublin-east Meath-south Louth area and for the north Kerry area, consideration will be given at that stage to extending it to other areas of the country.In the meantime the normal planning processes will continue to apply. This involves research by the school planning section of my Department into all the relevant factors affecting school accommodation in any given area including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. Liaison with existing schools is an important part of the process as is liaison with local authorities.In this way, every effort will be made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	868	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.The appeal board for mainstream staffing in primary schools adjudicates on applications from primary schools appealing their allocations of mainstream class teachers for a particular year. It is open to the board of management of a primary school to submit an appeal to the appeal board, which will consider the appeal in accordance with certain appeals criteria.The staffing of the first school referred to by the Deputy was considered by the appeal board on 21 July 2005. The appeal board did not uphold the appeal, and the board of management was notified accordingly.The boards of management of the second and third schools referred to by the Deputy have not submitted an appeal to date. The appeal board will next meet on 19 October 2005. The closing date for receipt of appeals is 7 October 2005. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The application form is available from primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, or on my Department's website.The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	870	The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003.Since 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs.Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil.My Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible. The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education.Officials in my Department have been advised by the NCSE that the establishment of a special class for children with autism in the school in question is under consideration by the local SENO.

Grant aid was approved accordingly. My Department did not receive any application from the school for the current school year.Details of the additional accommodation scheme for the 2006-07 school year were recently published and it is open to the school authority to apply under this scheme for any extra accommodation requirements it may have. The closing date for receipt of applications is 14 October 2005.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	872	I understand that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is attending a special class at primary level some distance from her home and is sharing a transport service with a number of other pupils attending the same class.On foot of requests for the provision of a more direct transport route in respect of the pupil concerned, my Department requested a report from Bus Éireann, which organises the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. The report, recently submitted by Bus Éireann, has confirmed that, having regard to the transport needs of all the pupils concerned and the costs of an alternative transport arrangement, the current standard of transport service is deemed reasonable.My Department endeavours to provide suitable transport for all pupils attending special schools and special classes. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that transport services for both primary and post-primary children must be co-ordinated and transport routes planned and shared in such a way as to provide the most efficient and cost-effective service.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	873	Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, children are eligible, subject to conditions, for free transport to their nearest national school or school of amalgamation. Pupils not attending their nearest national school may, subject to conditions, avail of concessionary fare-paying transport to another school, subject to spare accommodation being available on the bus and provided that no extra State cost is incurred by extending or rerouting the service. Pupils who do not meet the distance requirement may also avail of concessionary fare-paying transport subject to similar conditions.The eligibility of the pupils referred to by the Deputy for concessionary fare-paying transport will be assessed by Bus Éireann, which organises school transport on behalf of my Department, on receipt of the necessary applications, subject to the terms of the school transport scheme.

In the circumstances I understand that a SENO will make contact with this family in the very near future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The independent school transport appeals board met on 15 September 2005 and its decision was conveyed to the person referred to by the Deputy on 21 September 2005.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	876	Under the terms of my Department's higher education grants scheme a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level irrespective of whether a grant was paid previously. The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.Clause 7.7 of the higher education grants scheme does provide for financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progression. As a higher diploma in education does not represent progression from a master's degree as defined in clause 7.7. of the scheme, the students referred to by the Deputy are not therefore eligible for grant assistance.However, tax relief is available in respect of postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions on this tax relief are available from local tax offices.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	877	I propose to take Questions Nos. 506 and 507 together.I can confirm for the Deputy that the pupil in question has access to a full-time shared special needs assistant. As regards the provision of resource teaching support for this pupil, an application was made to the relevant special educational needs organiser, SENO, of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. The application in question did not meet the criteria for resource teaching hours and this decision was communicated to the school. The NCSE will, however, undertake to review a decision on resource teaching supports on foot of a request from the school or parents-guardians when accompanied by relevant additional information which may not have been to hand at the time of the original decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its circular 01/05.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	878	As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation scheme has been introduced under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. My officials have been in contact with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which has confirmed that following examination of an application for additional support for the pupil in question, it was determined that his needs fall within the high incidence disability category. Therefore his needs fall to be met from within the school's allocation of 17.5 part-time hours under the new general allocation system. This outcome has been communicated to the school authorities on 22 August 2005.The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, such as hearing impairment, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school has been allocated enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.My Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular, Sp. Ed. 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	879	Capital funding is being provided under the school building and modernisation programme 2005-2009 for the refurbishment of science laboratories undertaken as part of an overall refurbishment programme of second level schools, for the upgrading of science facilities exclusively or by provision of new facilities in the case of newly built or extended schools.Additionally I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the sciences. My Department spent in excess of €13 million in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised junior science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of €3,500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding.Funding is also available this year to schools that have yet to apply for the basic grant of €3,500 per science laboratory and for other specified equipment to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Schools have also received funding under the summer works scheme in 2004 and 2005 to refurbish science laboratories.In addition funding will be made available under the 2006 summer works scheme for science and technology upgrades. In the application, post-primary schools have been asked to specifically identify and provide details of any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for so that consideration can be given to approving these projects for 2006. The closing date for receipt of applications is 14 October 2005.Following the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science, the then Minister for Education and Science established a task force on the physical sciences to address the declining uptake of the physical sciences. The task force reported in March 2002. The report identified six action areas: planning and resources; equity, teaching and learning; curriculum and assessment; promotion of science; transition and integration into third-level. My Department continues to progress the recommendations of the task force on the physical sciences as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás and industry.Significant progress has been made in a range of areas pertaining to my Department. For example, a new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of €1,000 per school plus €10 per pupil, and revised syllabi in junior certificate science and in leaving certificate physics, chemistry and biology have been introduced. Work on the revision of the two remaining leaving certificate subjects — agricultural science and physics and chemistry combined is well advanced. The introduction of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.A review of grading of subjects in the leaving certificate and initial reports on teacher training have been undertaken. A review of mathematics at post-primary level is being undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. Investment in the programme of research in third level institutes is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development. Between this programme and the various grants to the research councils and other sources, an estimated €101.5 million will be invested in third level institutions in 2005.The Discover Science and Engineering programme, operated under the aegis of Forfás with the collaboration of the education sector, was launched in October 2003 to bring together existing science awareness activities in a unified strategy. I made a provision of €750,000 towards the cost of the BA Festival of Science, one of the world's leading science events, hosted by Trinity College this year. I will continue to keep this area under review.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	880	I propose to take Questions Nos. 510 and 512 together.The level of funding that my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patrúnachta na Gaelscoileanna, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. However, following discussions with Educate Together my Department has provided additional funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process. The amount of funding provided to Educate Together over the past five years is as follows: 2001 — €35,000; 2002 — €39,800; 2003 — €39,800; 2004 — €39,800; and 2005 — €81,133, which includes additional funding.As regards support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, it should be noted that my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage — 11 of which are open.My Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.

The rates of capitation grants for primary schools have been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €121.58 with effect from 1 January 2004 and has been further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2005 bringing the standard rate to €133.58. This represents an increase of almost 134% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.The standard rate of capitation grant paid per pupil in the last three years was as follows: from 1 January 2003 — €111.58 per pupil; from 1 January 2004 — €121.58 per pupil; and from 1 January 2005 — €133.58 per pupil. Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to all mainstream schools. The current rates range from €388.00 to €607.50 per pupil.

These responsibilities include the following: deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; and processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs.The National Council for Special Education allocates additional teaching and other resources in accordance with my Department's resourcing policies to support the special educational needs of children with disabilities. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.My Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools. The precise model of provision made available will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. In general, where a special class for pupils with autism is established by my Department, such classes are staffed by one teacher and two special needs assistants and can cater for a maximum of six pupils. However, my Department provides for a flexible approach to applying these standard ratios to allow for individual school and pupil factors to be taken into account. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.Where a school wishes to establish a special class in order to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities, an application must be submitted to the relevant SENO. In this regard, it is my Department's understanding that the school in question is in the process of submitting an application to the SENO for the establishment of such a class for pupils with autism. When this is received, it will then be considered.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	883	I propose to take Questions Nos. 515, 516, 522 and 523 together.My Department established the special education support service, SESS, in September 2003 to develop and provide a range of supports to schools at primary and post-primary levels working with children with special educational needs, SEN. In addition to the range of services and support it provides to teachers and schools, the SESS currently has four teams of trainers in place, two of which are addressing priority SEN areas including whole school staff training for post-primary schools and autism.The service also provides fee support for teachers on an on-line interactive training programme on autism and a very relevant programme on inclusion. The programmes are scheduled to commence on 17 October and will run until 2 December.Given the specific nature of the required assistance for the secondary school, it is best that the principal of the school contacts the national co-ordinator of the special education support service to discuss further the in-service needs of the school. As a result, I have asked officials in my Department to facilitate this process.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	884	Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities which wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.The school in question applied for a curricular concession allocation and was allocated 7.22 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. The school was notified of this allocation on 10 May 2005 and advised that, in the event of its not being satisfied with this allocation, it could appeal in writing to the independent appeals committee. An appeal was submitted by the school and the independent appeals committee decided that no further allocation was warranted.The total teaching staff allocation to the school for the 2005-06 school year is 67.48 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. Based on a projected enrolment of 790 pupils this level of allocation leaves the school with an actual pupil teacher ratio of 11.71:1.My Department has recently received correspondence from the school authority in question concerning the issues referred to by the Deputy. This further correspondence has been referred to the independent appeals committee. My Department will contact the school shortly with the outcome.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	885	I propose to take Questions Nos. 518 and 521 together.My Department is inquiring into the detail of the works carried out at the school to which the Deputy refers and will contact the school authority directly on the matter.With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. These responsibilities include the following: deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs; and recommending accommodation solutions where such needs are identified.The council allocates additional teaching and other resources in accordance with my Department's resourcing policies to support the special educational needs of children with disabilities.

In the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.Where a school wishes to establish a special class in order to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities, an application must be submitted to the relevant SENO.Funding for accommodation requirements for special needs pupils is provided under the overall capital allocation for primary and post primary schools. It is part of the SENO's remit to make a recommendation to the school planning section of my Department regarding an accommodation solution where a need arises. The school planning section will assess the need for such accommodation in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. The provision of accommodation for special needs pupils attracts a band 1 rating, the highest rating possible.

It does not have a role in the terms and conditions of employment of special needs teachers or special needs assistants which are matters for agreement between my Department, school management authorities and the relevant trade unions. Since 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs.Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil. Any such support is sanctioned on a temporary basis and is subject to annual review in the light of any changed circumstances and-or emerging needs of the pupil or pupils concerned.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	889	The condition of the Turoe stone, which was moved to its present location in 1854, has been a matter of concern for a number of years. A report in 1996 found that the stone was undergoing adverse weathering. A further report undertaken in May 2005 found that the condition of the stone had worsened since 1996 with a reduction in the clarity of the carved detail.In response, and to provide better for the conservation of the monument, OPW intends to cover the stone for the winter to protect it from severe frost and harmful organic growth. In addition, my Department is consulting with the OPW and the National Museum of Ireland on long-term measures, including the possibility of moving the stone to an indoor location, which may be necessary to prevent further deterioration of the stone.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	890	The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 specify the minimum standards applying to rented accommodation, both private and social. While the regulations specify minimum standards, I do not accept that they provide insufficient protection for tenants. Accommodation that fully complies with the existing regulations will be of an acceptable standard. As the regulations are now 12 years in operation, it is my intention to review their content once the process of bedding down the new tenancy legislative regime permits.Enforcement of the standards regulations continues to be a function of local authorities. It is their responsibility to establish whether accommodation does or does not comply and to take enforcement action against the landlord where it finds a breach of the regulations. It is not a function of authorities to assess the level of quality of the accommodation but rather to establish if it is in compliance with the minimum standards requirements.There is a responsibility on each local authority to carry out its functions under the standards regulations as effectively and proactively as possible. To this end, the transfer to local authorities of fee income available from the registration of tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, will, in future years, be based on each authority's performance in enforcing the standards and rent books regulations as evidenced by their statistical returns, as well as the level of registrations relating to their functional areas and the need to distribute income across the four-year tenancy cycle.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	891	I propose to take Questions Nos. 528 and 534 together.Charging development contributions is of long standing. Under section 26(2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963, local authorities were empowered to require payment of a development contribution as a condition of a planning permission. The system has therefore been in operation for some 40 years. In order to introduce transparency into the system, the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced new provisions whereby local authorities had to prepare schemes setting out how development contributions would apply in their area. All planning permissions granted by planning authorities after the adoption of development contribution schemes under the Planning and Development Act 2000 are subject to the conditions of those schemes.Information regarding development contributions collected by planning authorities is published in my Department's annual planning statistics, which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Information on the total amount of development contributions collected by planning authorities in the years 1997 to 2003 has been forwarded to the Deputy. The 2004 planning statistics are being compiled. An initial estimate of the total amount collected in development contributions in that year is €350 million.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	893	A preliminary report has been submitted to my Department by Dublin City Council setting out an outline of the scope of regeneration proposals for the Charlemont Street flats, including the Tom Kelly flats complex. As this is a preliminary report, the matter will require detailed consideration by the Department, in consultation with Dublin City Council, of the nature and extent of the proposed refurbishment and how it should be implemented in the most cost effective manner. This examination of these major proposals is being advanced by the Department and a decision will be conveyed to Dublin City Council as soon as possible. The question of committing funding to these outline proposals does not arise at this stage.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	894	I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 533 together.The EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, required each member state to introduce regulations providing for a producer funded take-back scheme for consumers of end-of-life equipment from 13 August 2005. This directive covers a wide range of equipment from large business equipment, such as large refrigeration units, down to the smallest of consumer products such as pocket calculators and the like.Under the terms of the directive the funding of such take-back schemes is a producer responsibility. The directive also requires the achievement by member states of specified targets for recovery, reuse and recycling by producers of different classes of WEEE.A fundamental aim of the directive is to ensure that the cost of recycling electronic and electrical equipment is built into the product price in the same way as the raw material costs of steel and plastic etc., manufacturing, distribution and sale. However, the directive also recognises that, for a number of years to come, a significant proportion of the waste arising in this area will be what is termed "historic WEEE", namely products which were originally sold before the directive came into effect. Current producers must bear the cost of recycling this waste regardless of the identity of the original producer. Under the directive, producers are allowed, for a transitional period of eight years — ten years for large household appliances — to show purchasers, at the time of sale of new products, the costs of collection, treatment and disposal of historic WEEE in an environmentally sound manner, by means of visible environmental management costs or EMCs.The Waste Management (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Regulations 2005 which fully transpose the WEEE directive in Ireland were introduced following two public consultations. The first of these followed publication of the WEEE task force report in April 2004, and the second followed publication of draft regulations in April 2005. Extensive discussion took place with representatives of producers, importers and retailers of electrical and electronic goods in Ireland. While there were varying opinions on how the provisions in relation to the historic waste should operate, the majority view among the industry, for reasons of fuller transparency and greater accountability, favoured a system of visible EMCs in the manner which has been provided for under the regulations. The design of the new system assures the public that the moneys collected for recycling are actually assigned for recycling activity and are not diverted elsewhere. It also ensures traceability and financial accountability and, by informing the public in an open way, ensures that profiteering is prevented.Visible EMCs are designed solely to cover the cost of recycling of WEEE and none of the revenue involved is handled by the Government. The WEEE Register Society will monitor the implementation of the scheme and adjust the visible environmental management costs periodically to ensure that the not-for-profit principle is observed and that the visible environmental management costs only covers the costs incurred in the environmentally sound management of WEEE.The EMCs which have been validated by the WEEE Register Society are set out in the following table. The EMC for electric toothbrushes has been set at €1, and for toys at a zero rate.Prices generally are falling in the electrical and electronic sectors and that this trend is expected to continue. Even in areas where there are price pressures due to low margins and high recycling costs, particularly the white goods area, consumers are benefiting now under the WEEE directive by availing of free recycling services which did not exist before the 13 August. Visible EMCs are input costs and how these are dealt with in the pricing of products is part of the normal negotiations between producer and retailer To put the overall impact of the WEEE directive in context, it is estimated that the total cost of recycling waste equipment under the new scheme is around €14 million in an industry of in excess of €1.4 billion annually. Having regard to this, the overall impact on the electric and electronic sector is likely to be negligible. The recycling services operated under the scheme are now being utilised by an increasing number of consumers at a considerable saving to them compared to previous waste disposal costs. There are currently 64 civic amenity sites in operation compared with only 28 in 1995. Additional recycling infrastructure is currently being put in place, and proposals for further facilities are being considered for funding.In addition to producers, retailers of electrical and electronic goods also have responsibilities under the directive. Retailers are obliged to take back at least free of charge household WEEE on a one-for-one basis, namely replacing the equipment of similar type or fulfilling the sale function. Customers have 15 days to return a corresponding piece of obsolete equipment. Retailers delivering large appliances are obliged to take the obsolete equipment back immediately, if available for collection for example disconnected from utilities etc. If the obsolete appliance is not available for immediate collection, the customer has 30 days to return it to the retailer.The WEEE directive allows for exemptions from the normal waste permitting requirements for the storage and transport of WEEE. A modified permitting regime is operating under which retailers are required to register their premises with their local authority namely a county or city council. This registration system is straightforward, with retailers required to complete and sign a form undertaking to comply with general binding rules on the environmentally sound management of WEEE and forward this with a small fee of €20 to their local authority. Local authorities may only accept WEEE from retailers who are registered. Subject to certain conditions, retailers who have registered with local authorities are permitted to deposit household WEEE at civic amenity sites operated by or on behalf of local authorities free of charge.Electric and electronic goods have been identified internationally as a problematic and potentially hazardous waste stream. Ireland has moved quickly in support of EU co-ordinated action in this area. While there has been criticism in this House in the past over delays in transposing EU directives, we can take pride that Ireland is one of only a small number of member states which have fully implemented this directive by the due date.€

It is normal practice, and in line with the principles of better regulation, to issue ministerial planning guidelines in draft form and to take into account any submissions made when finalising the text. Given that this is normal practice, I am not aware of any confusion among planning authorities in advance of the final text being published.Guidelines for planning authorities on development management and development plans are at an advanced stage of preparation and it is intended to publish them for consultation shortly. Preliminary work on drafting guidelines in respect of public safety zones at State airports has also begun and it is intended to publish them for public consultation later this year.My Department recently consulted stakeholders on the second draft of the revised permission regulations. Their views are now being considered in the final draft. I hope to be in a position to sign those regulations shortly.

The underwater archaeology unit also participated in a presentation on the work of the national monuments section of my Department at the European Association of Archaeologists conference held in Cork during heritage week.The underwater archaeology unit has always been pro-active in promoting awareness of our underwater heritage by giving talks to local historical societies, to dive and sailing clubs and other interested groups. The work of the unit has been covered in a positive way on radio, television and the print media. The results of the unit's work has been published in academic journals and in popular form and every effort is made to inform the public on the results of the unit's activities.

All local authorities are due to implement the new arrangements during 2005. Roll-out commenced in an initial group of lead authorities, namely Dublin, Galway and Limerick City Councils, South Dublin, Donegal, Offaly-Westmeath County Councils and Drogheda Borough Council. Cork City and County Councils and South Tipperary County Council are now implementing the RAS.I refer to the reply to Question No. 175 of 29 September where I outlined the main actions to date in implementing the scheme. Based on end June Department of Social and Family Affairs data, a table detailing the number of rent supplement recipients for a continuous 18-month period or more by county follows. Local authority experience to date has indicated that the transfer of households from rent supplement to the RAS will take longer than anticipated. Each transfer has to be conducted on a case by case basis involving contact and information gathering with the community welfare service, the rent supplement recipient and the recipient's landlord. In addition, each individual contract has to be negotiated with the accommodation provider. Good progress is being made regarding these detailed and important local arrangements.The original target set on introduction of the programme for households to transfer to the RAS in 2005 will not be achieved, because of the need to tailor arrangements according to individual and local requirements. In the meantime, eligible RAS households will continue in receipt of SWA rent supplement.The first transfers to the RAS occurred in September 2005 with 25 households transferring from the SWA rent supplement scheme in the Galway City Council area. It is estimated that a further 300 households will transfer to the RAS in October, the majority of which will be in the Dublin city, Galway city and South Dublin County Council areas.The Department does not hold detailed information on individual RAS cases. Local authorities will be required to make statistical returns to the Department in the context of compiling the Department's quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletins. Statistical data on the RAS will be available in the fourth quarter 2005 housing statistics bulletin, copies of which will be available in the Oireachtas Library when published.CountyRecipientsCarlow447Cavan205Clare716Cork3,924Donegal1,003Dublin13,551Galway2,126Kerry921Kildare1,341Kilkenny374Laois172Leitrim80Limerick1,171Longford202Louth886Mayo958Meath319Monaghan171Offaly231Roscommon301Sligo219Tipperary949Waterford794Westmeath442Wexford1,007Wicklow953Total33,463

The project was not recommended for grant assistance by the expert panel which assesses applications under this scheme and consequently it did not receive funding in 2005. It would be open to the project promoters to make a further application for funding under the 2006 conservation grants scheme. Calls for applications under the 2006 scheme will be made later this year.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	899	The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES, is implemented at EU level principally by Council Regulation (EC) 338/97, with further aspects being covered by Commission Regulation (EC) 1808/2001. This regulatory regime is stricter than CITES in that it requires permits for the bulk of the species whose trade is regulated by the convention rather than just the very rarest species, as under CITES. In addition, there are controls on internal trade of the rarer species.The Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 designated my Department as national management authority for CITES, with competence for issuing permits and licences and for enforcing the regulations. In the year 2004, some 33 licences were issued by my Department. My Department also acts as the scientific authority for CITES, providing scientific advice on matters relating to the convention and regulations.At the operational level, staff of my Department's national parks and wildlife service, together with the Customs and Excise service under its own powers, have been responsible for monitoring and enforcing the convention in Ireland. This includes following up on reports of unlawful importation of CITES protected species, monitoring of advertisements that might indicate unlawful trade in such species, the confiscation of specimens where the necessary documentation cannot be produced and, where appropriate, pursuing cases through the courts.Since Ireland's ratification of CITES, there have been a number of confiscations of both plant and animal specimens and products. I understand that in 2005 to date there have been seven seizures by customs officials. Seizures by NPWS staff average some five or six annually. One prosecution has so far been brought to court by my Department and a fine was imposed.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	900	I propose to take Questions Nos. 540 and 541 together.Ireland's national sustainable development strategy was published in 1997 and reviewed in the context of the world summit on sustainable development in 2002. It provides the framework for Ireland's response to Agenda 21, the world agenda for sustainable development agreed at the earth summit in Rio in 1992. A core objective in the sustainable development strategy is to ensure that both the economy and society in Ireland can develop to their full potential within a well protected environment, without compromising the quality of that environment and with responsibility towards present and future generations and the wider international community.The progress made in implementing the strategy was reflected in the EPA State of the Environment report for 2004. Success has been achieved in areas such as decoupling energy and materials intensity from economic growth, promoting cleaner methods of industrial production and more environmentally friendly agriculture, and raising environmental awareness. A key mechanism for overseeing the implementation of the strategy is Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Partnership, which was established in 1999 as the forum for national consultation and dialogue on all issues relating to sustainable development. Its terms of reference are, in brief, to advance the national agenda for sustainable development, to assist in devising suitable mechanisms and advising on their implementation and to contribute to the formation of a national consensus in these regards. Comhar has completed its second term of office and I will shortly announce the new membership for its third term.The key to the future direction of our national sustainable development strategy will be the outcome of the current mid-term review of the EU sustainable development strategy. Once this review has been finalised, my Department will consider any steps that will need to be taken to update our national strategy.At a local level, sustainable development is supported by Local Agenda 21, which is implemented by local authorities in accordance with the guidance issued in 2001 called "Towards Sustainable Development — Guidelines on Local Agenda 21". The Local Agenda 21 environmental partnership fund was established in 1997 and is intended to promote sustainable development by assisting environmental awareness projects at a local level. The fund is co-financed by the Department and the local authorities and is administered by the local authorities with the Department maintaining a supervisory role. Since its inception in 1997, over 1,000 projects have been awarded funding totalling almost €2 million.This year I am providing funding of €250,000 for the 2005 Local Agenda 21 environmental partnership fund and matching funding by local authorities will create a potential fund of €500,000. Details of this year's environmental partnership fund have already issued to local authorities and were advertised in the national print media on 6 September 2005. The closing date for receipt of applications is 7 October 2005.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	901	The Department of Finance has responsibility for public procurement policy. The website www.etenders.gov.ie, maintained by the national public procurement policy unit of the Department of Finance, contains comprehensive information on all aspects of public procurement, including guidance and clarification for public bodies on how environmental considerations may be taken into account and promoted in public procurement. The website also contains the EU Handbook on Environmental Public Procurement which was published in October 2004 by the European Commission and has the aim of explaining to public purchasers how to integrate environmental considerations into their purchasing practices for goods and services. The Department of Finance has indicated that the website is to be the principal means of disseminating procurement guidance.It is estimated that the total Government purchasing budget is between €8 billion and €10 billion per annum. The Action at Work manual, launched in February 2005 as part of the race against waste campaign, contains useful guidance for organisations on how to green their procurement processes. The manual has been given wide circulation in the public sector and is available on the race against waste website, www.raceagainstwaste.ie.My Department is the contact point for a survey of public sector bodies currently being carried out across all member states on behalf of the European Commission. The survey is intended to benchmark the level to which environmental considerations are currently integrated into the procurement processes of public bodies. The results are expected to inform the development of action plans on green public procurement envisaged as part of the implementation of the EU environmental technologies action plan.My Department also promotes green procurement in the following ways: by adopting green procurement specifications for goods and services purchased for use by the Department itself and reporting on this in our annual report and on our website; by encouraging and facilitating the Government Supplies Agency to include a range of environmentally preferable products in its supply contracts for Government Departments; by participating in a tender for the supply of greener electricity as part of a contract organised by the Department of Finance.In communications with local authorities on procurement, my Department provides advice and information regarding the inclusion of environmental criteria in the award of contracts. Furthermore, the national construction and demolition waste council, the national waste prevention committee and the market development group will be considering issues relating to the advancement of green procurement.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	902	Each planning authority is required under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to make a development plan every six years. Section 15 of the Act provides that it is the duty of a planning authority to take such steps within its powers as may be necessary for securing the objectives of the development plan. It also provides that, no more than two years after the making of a development plan, the manager of a planning authority shall give a report to the members of the planning authority on the progress achieved in securing the objectives of the development plan.Not later than four years after the making of a development plan each planning authority is required to initiate the process of reviewing its existing development plan and to prepare a new development plan for its area. A planning authority may also, for stated reasons, make a variation of the development plan which for the time being is in force. The foregoing provisions apply only to development plans.I propose in the near future to publish, for consultation, draft guidelines on development plans for planning authorities. It is intended in these guidelines to deal specifically with the issue of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the objectives and policies set out in development plans and to provide advice to planning authorities on the necessary information and criteria against which the effectiveness of plans can be evaluated in terms of achieving their stated aims.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	903	The Green Government Guide — Promoting Environmental Management in Practice was published and issued to all Departments in August 1996. The guide encourages Departments to promote good environmental practice and to integrate environmental considerations into their operations.The action at work programme, launched in February 2005 as part of the Race Against Waste campaign, aims to improve environmental management, in particular waste management, in public sector bodies and other large organisations. The action at work documentation, along with the seminars which are taking place throughout the country, provide practical assistance to public sector and other organisations on how they can improve their waste management systems. Earlier this year I wrote to all Departments asking for their support in implementing action at work both in the Departments themselves and in their related agencies. Further activities aimed at improving environmental performance in public bodies are being developed as part of the current phase of the race against waste campaign.My Department has operated an environmental management system, accredited to ISO 14001 standard, for its Custom House headquarters since 2003. Plans are being developed to extend ISO 14001 certification to other departmental buildings as appropriate.

This consultation includes any environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to section 26 of the Act. The authority is not required under section 25 of the Act to advertise applications for certification that proposed development is consistent with a planning scheme.I am informed by the authority that before determining any application it satisfies itself that the information contained therein is accurate.

As a general rule, my Department understands that water supply service connections to individual dwellings do not use asbestos cement pipes, which are of large diameter.An information leaflet entitled Asbestos in your Home, AP6, is available from ENFO, my Department's public information service on environmental matters. It is available on the ENFO website, www.enfo.ie. This includes advice on the maintenance of asbestos materials, and their removal and disposal. The leaflet advises the public to contact the Health and Safety Authority to obtain information about the handling and use of asbestos. Relevant advice on the disposal of asbestos would also be available on request from local authorities and the EPA.

Dublin City Council has sought to develop a set of proposals for the sale of flats to tenants, the latest version of which was received in my Department on 29 June 2005. These proposals, which are still at a developmental stage, are being considered in the context of the examination of the range of social housing policy issues raised by NESC in the report, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy.The broad thrust of the proposals is to set up a special scheme for the sale of flats to tenants that will provide for the ongoing management of the complex where the sales are taking place, the creation of a sinking fund to allow for future refurbishment of the complex and the payment of service charges. The scheme, as proposed, provides for prior consultation with and democratic input from tenants affected by the sales scheme.

My Department recoups to the local authorities 90% of their expenditure on accommodation related costs arising in respect of homeless persons including, where appropriate, victims of domestic violence. Decisions on both capital and current funding for accommodation for victims of domestic violence, including refuges and transitional accommodation, are matters for the local authority in the area where the accommodation is situated. Associated care costs are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.Kildare County Council has been in contact with the service provider in the case in question and is awaiting further information regarding design and costing matters.

The Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 introduced new superannuation and retirement provisions for new entrants appointed to the public service, including local authorities, on or after 1 April 2004. In relation to local authority officials, the Act provides that, with the exception of fire fighters, new entrants appointed on or after 1 April 2004 will not be required to retire on age grounds and that the age of 65 will be the minimum age at which a pension may be paid.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	915	There is no grant assistance available for private sector recycling projects.When the capital grants scheme for waste management infrastructure projects was launched in 2002 it was intended that it be made available to both public and private sector applicants. However, private sector funding was conditional on obtaining the necessary State aid approval from the European Commission.In the event the State aid approval given was of a limited nature. Also, in the interim, private waste industry's scale increased very significantly over a short period of time, a marked process of consolidation became evident and some of the projects for which grant applications had been submitted proceeded in any case.It became clear, therefore, that a grant scheme for private companies would be more likely to distort competition in the sector or to impact on enhancing acquisition values in the context of industry consolidation, than to have a significant effect on the provision of recycling and recovery infrastructure. On foot of this, my predecessor decided that it would be more effective to redeploy the funding in question to other related initiatives and in particular towards greater enforcement of waste legislation. The latter measure had been strongly advocated by the industry, to address the problem of unfair competition from contractors operating outside the law.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	916	As indicated in the reply to Question No. 1410 of 28 September 2005, the position in this matter is as follows.The boundaries of this candidate special area of conservation, SAC, were re-examined by my Department, for two reasons.First, there was a revised national approach to the designation of marginal areas along rivers, introduced in August 2004, following an agreement with the farm organisations under Sustaining Progress. A nationwide survey to revise SAC boundaries along rivers was undertaken. The relevant section of the agreement reached with the farm organisations under Sustaining Progress reads as follows: The Department will implement a revised approach to designation of marginal areas along rivers. The revised SAC will include bank-side only to 2.5 m from the river bank. If embankments or other features are present which will curtail direct run-off, the margin can be further reduced accordingly. Where special features are present, for example associated wildlife habitat or flood plain, they will continue to be included.An objection was lodged by ecological consultants in November 2004, on behalf of a landowner, relating to the location referred to in the Deputy's question. The objection was considered by my Department following standard procedures. It was assessed by staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, who visited the site. They found that one relatively small field in the area under appeal did not form part of the flood plain of the Carrigower River, as it is was raised above the river by a number of metres and held no habitat of interest. It was concluded that this specific piece of land did not meet the scientific criteria for inclusion in the SAC in the first instance. This gave rise to a minor boundary adjustment, excluding less than one acre from the SAC.In contrast, the low-lying fields beside the river, which were also under appeal, are being retained in the SAC as my Department's staff were satisfied that they form part of the flood plain of the Carrigower River. This means that an area about 100 m wide is retained within the SAC here, rather than the 2.5 m wide strip that would be justified if there was no flood plain here. The specific decisions on this appeal conform with the revised national approach to designation of marginal areas along rivers.
