        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The revised terms of reference are to complete the review of the Constitution already undertaken by the previous two all-party committees. The Constitution can, broadly speaking, be divided into two distinct areas; the articles dealing with the institutions of State and those dealing with fundamental rights. The previous two committees completed the review of the institutions of State except for those relating to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">The Lenihan committee also reported on the article relating to the right to life, at my request, and in connection with the issue of abortion. The work of the new committee will be to (i) review the articles on Government and thus complete the review of the institutions of State; and (ii) complete the review of the articles on fundamental rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The Government has requested the committee to give priority to the articles dealing with property and those dealing with children.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I am aware that it is a matter for the new chairman and the members of the committee to set their own work programme within the context of the terms of reference. I understand they held their first meeting today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_8">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution made a recommendation that North of Ireland participation in the Seanad would be enhanced. Is the Taoiseach in favour of this and  will he comment on it? The committee also recommended that university representation in the Seanad, in isolation, be discontinued. Does the Taoiseach support that view or does he regard someone who achieves any third level qualification as eligible, in the words of the committee, for selection as a Member of one of our core democratic processes?</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The committee recommended that the minimum age of eligibility for the office of President be changed from 35 to 18 years. It indicated there was no logical reason for setting the age at which one becomes eligible to be President to be any different from that at which one can exercise a vote, namely, 18 years of age. Does the Taoiseach favour those three concepts?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_3">
          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_10">Those three questions might go outside the questions asked by the Deputy and Deputy Higgins.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_11">Perhaps I can give a brief reply to the Deputy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusPattison" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_5">
          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_12">Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_6">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_13">To answer the questions in reverse order, I do not agree with the committee's view on the question of reducing the age from 35 to 18. To be President of the country and a constitutional office holder of the State, one has the responsibilities of making decisions on legislation to be referred to the Council of State, and I do not believe an 18 year old can do that. There should not be any change in that regard. The committee's argument was a simplistic one in that the President was just another person, but that is not the issue. The issue is the job and the job entails a person having a broad knowledge, and I do not believe a person can have gathered all of that knowledge at 18 years of age. Perhaps a person has not gathered it at age 35 either but in my view the argument does not hold.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">On the other issue about representation in the Seanad, the committee points to a valuable precedent established by the contributions of past and present Senators from the North and I agree it would be valuable to extend and formalise the existing practice, which opens up options in the committee. The options brought forward by the committee deserve careful consideration and there is a move to start a more general review of the Seanad, with which I agree. That review should examine representation from the North, to which I am agreeable, and it should also deal with the aspect of university representation because there are clear inequalities in the university representation issue which should be examined in any review of the Seanad. In any event, it is a long time since the present structure of the Seanad came into existence and it would be a useful exercise to have a review of the Seanad on an all-party basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I thank the Taoiseach for that reply. Perhaps in the context of the broader reform of the Seanad some elements of the document, A Democratic Revolution, drawn up by the late Jim Mitchell on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, might be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">In that context, will the Taoiseach consider allowing MEPs to attend and address the Seanad on issues of importance to the country in a European context? Will the reform include references to emigrants appointing Senators to vote on their behalf? This issue was discussed on Private Members' business a number of years ago and while it is quite complex, the emigrant vote has consistently referred to the right of participation in the democratic system here.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">On the Taoiseach's reference to abortion, is the Government likely to give consideration to the consequences of the last referendum? In other words, is it intended at some future time to produce legislation giving effect to what is currently contained in the Constitution?</p>
          <p eId="para_18">When does the Taoiseach expect the referendum to take place on the next European Union treaty, following the next intergovernmental conference, which I am sure was discussed by the Heads of Government in Copenhagen on Friday?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_19">Deputy Kenny asked about allowing MEPs the right to debate in the Seanad. The report stated that MEPs elected in both the North and this State would be entitled to have debates on EU matters in the Seanad. The Government supports this and the necessary procedural steps in dealing with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">No consideration has been given to the abortion issue since the referendum in March. Ultimately, consideration will have to be given to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The question of allowing emigrants to vote has been looked at several times but there is no easy way to address it. The idea of having Irish voting blocs abroad did not find favour in any of the reviews because of the numbers involved and our system of proportional representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">A referendum on an EU treaty arising from the recent intergovernmental conference may be held in 2004, but it is more likely to be 2005. When the convention was set up it was to have completed its work by February, but it will only discuss the first draft text on 20 January. It will attempt to work more quickly. If it was to be very efficient and there was to be little debate or argument one could imagine it being cleared next year. Debate on the Nice intergovernmental conference – which dealt with only a small number of issues compared to this one – took 12 months. I know there was not a presidium or convention before this but the issues involved are sizeable. I would be surprised if the debate on many of the institutional matters – such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and issues on the future of Europe – does not open up when it moves from the presidium and convention into the wider political arena.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_23">Will the Taoiseach consider extending the remit of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution to examine Article 43 to further delineate that the right to property carries responsibilities? Presumably Article 43 is one of the reasons why the Taoiseach has not moved in the past five and a half years to stem the outrageous profiteering in building land. This, of course, is apart from the closeness of Fianna Fáil to developers and the donations it receives from them. Does the Taoiseach agree this matter should be examined as a matter of urgency? Amendments could be brought forward to prevent the uncontrolled profiteering we have seen and to reduce the price of homes so all those in need of a home could buy one at a reasonable price. If this were done, and if Michael Davitt and others involved in the Land League returned, they would not be as shocked – as I am sure they would be if they saw what is happening with this abuse of the Constitution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_10">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_24">I am sure the Deputy would agree that the committee on the Constitution should examine the argument dealing with property. Such an examination of those rights would be important.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">There is some truth in what the Deputy said in that there is always a view that we cannot do much in this area without changing the Constitution. Therefore, the proposed examination would be worthwhile. I agree that one aspect of this issue is that the current system allows for profit taking and for the cost of land to rise, which directly affects the cost of building land. That is not the only issue involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Another issue is the lack of zoning. In development plans a line is drawn around an area and development is restricted outside that area. That creates a problem in that land within such an area attracts high money. We create that problem ourselves by way of our local authorities and systems in a country in which there is plenty of land. We restrict development under the planning regulations. Maybe it is right to do that, but that is the reason land in zoned areas is excessively priced. Developers then buy land at a higher margin and the circle continues, which creates a major difficulty.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_27">The reason I asked the Taoiseach to extend the remit of the committee to examine this article is to remove that precise argument. My interpretation is that Article 43—</p>

          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_28">It is not appropriate to hear the Deputy's interpretation of that article at this point. He is going into too much detail.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I wish to clarify the issue with the Taoiseach by asking him a question. Does he agree that it could be clearly drawn from that article of the Constitution that the exigencies of  the common good should come before profiteering, but since the Constitution is used as an excuse—</p>

          <p eId="para_32">I ask the Taoiseach to indicate to the House where all this is going. What is the point of it? We had the Whitaker report compiled by outside experts. I believe we have had seven reports from this Oireachtas committee.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_33">Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_34">That is an awful lot of reports. Is the Taoiseach aiming towards a new Constitution being put to the people or are we merely engaged in this exercise with a view to possible minor amendments to the Constitution at some stage? It is a long time since 1937 and maybe the Taoiseach is preparing to emulate the original author by putting to the people a document that would be more in keeping with modern times. Is that the Taoiseach's objective?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_19">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_35">As I spelt out in my reply, we have focused on two sections of the Constitution, the articles dealing with the institutions of the State and those dealing with fundamental rights. We have asked the committee to complete its review of the institutions of the State and to make proposals for implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">We have had a number of referenda. Five issues were put to the people in the previous Government's first year in office. Those were followed by the local government constitutional issue and following that three issues were put to the people on the same day, although a Judiciary issue remains outstanding. We also had a referendum on the right to life and two referenda on the Nice treaty. There have been an enormous number of referendums. Each time we are told to hold it on one issue and not to confuse matters, and that is another problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I would like to take a block of the work already undertaken on the reports and deal with it as a whole. I have inquired of both legal people and officials over the past year or so how that could best be done, how we could take several of these amendments together, because they must at least be dealt with in sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">There are seven areas covered by seven reports. Even if they were divided into the two areas I mentioned, they would still have to be listed in a way whereby the people would understand them. Report one dealt with general constitutional issues. Report two dealt with the Seanad, and that debate is ongoing. Report three dealt with the Presidency. Amendments have been formulated for this area and it should be possible to  take a block of them and put them to the people. Some work has been done on the courts and the Judiciary and some remains outstanding. We decided not to proceed with the referendum in the courts area and proposals have been formulated to deal with that in another way. We have dealt with the abortion issue and the people rejected the referendum. Report six dealt with referendums, and that has been implemented. Report seven, which is not completed, deals with Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">A number of questions arise from these reports. I have given them to Departments to obtain their comments, mainly the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because it is generally but not exclusively the relevant Department. I would like to put an omnibus series of these amendments to the people, and it is a matter of finding a way to do that. Otherwise, we would move to the Swiss model and hold regular referendums.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">The matter has moved from the committee established on foot of the Whitaker report to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution chaired by Deputies Brian Lenihan and Jim O'Keeffe. We have tracked it all the way through, despite the historically high number of referendums we have held in the past five years. It is a matter of finding an order for the amendments whereby we can put them to the people in blocks. If we put them individually, we will never reach the end of the process. I must bow to superior legal knowledge in my search to see if it can be done. I have asked the all-party committee to examine the proposals on implementation and will give it the work I have done over the past year on this issue, which is based on legal work.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">There is no legislative proposal on that matter, although a case is before the courts. I understand they have not ruled on that case which was taken some time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Regarding the timescale, I have done as much as I can on some of the blocks of work. It is a question now of seeing if we can work with the committee. On the fundamental rights issues, we have blocked off equality before the law, which is Article 40; personal rights, which is Article 43; personal liberty, which is Article 44; freedom of expression; freedom of assembly; and freedom of association.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">We have blocked together the work of the committee on most of these articles. All the work has come from the all-party committee or from the committee established on foot of the Whitaker report, which was a general report. Most  of the amendments arise from the work done by Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Brian Lenihan as Chairmen of the all-party committee. I will be able to present to the committee a fairly tight report of what we can do and the views of Departments. It is then a question of whether we can take a number of the amendments together. If we had to take them all separately, it would be very long drawn out. The Whitaker report came out in 1995 so about seven years' work has gone into this and it will take a few more to finish it.</p>

We have prepared drafts on the gender proofing of both texts of the Constitution. No work has been done on the trial of offences. Some work has been done on the directives of social partnership. Some work has been done on the new provisions relating to the Ombudsman, environmental issues, and human rights commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">As the work has progressed I have tried to keep it in the two blocks – institutions of State and fundamental rights. Although the Constitution was not originally drafted in that way, these issues fall neatly under those two headings. Each time there has been a report, I have used those two headings and the same is true for each article. I intend to give these to the committee members. If the committee believes we could take a block together, we could do this quite quickly. However the legal view and that of the committees to date is that each issue has to be taken separately. I am concerned we would never get to the end of it on that basis. The Deputy asked for my view and that is to take the issues as a block.</p>

Everybody agrees the Seanad in its present form is an anachronism – just as the House of Lords was and possibly still is. However, at least that House introduced changes there. When will we see changes in the Seanad? Who will decide on what those changes will be? When will a presentation be made to the people to change the Constitution in that regard? In answer to the question specifically asked by Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach said there should be a general review of the Seanad. There have been two general reviews by the committee. What will now happen? This is where a certain element of frustration arises.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I do not seek to confuse Deputy O'Keeffe. I stated that I was asking the committee only on the implementation of those proposals. I am not referring to the committee work it has already done. Last year I gave the schedule of work that came back and there must have been more than 100 different proposals from the committee. The point I made to Deputy Rabbitte was that we could not put 100 separate questions to the people or even have a series of referendums. There has to be some way of taking them in blocks, which is what I have been endeavouring to do. I can understand the committee's views based on the reports going through. I do not agree with all its decisions and I have mentioned some of them already to Deputy Kenny. I would like it to give its political view on how we can put these proposals, as it will be for the Members of this House to try to sell them to the people and get support for the changes. We have to find a format for doing this. I am not referring back to it any of the proposals that have already been made.</p>

We should not allow the matter to drag on.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">With regard to some of the other areas, it is simply a matter of finding a mechanism to put them before the people again. This will entail doing a great deal of work on issues such as gender and on the format. Once the committee has seen my suggestions, it will accept that it is not easy to devise a method to put the matter before the people again. However, I hope we will be able, at least, to finalise much of our work within 12 months. The outstanding work could then continue for a further period.</p>

However, there has also been a considerable amount of sitting on the fence in regard to this argument. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe will be more familiar than I with people's views on these matters. If the legal advice is correct, we may as well wait until the end of the process and try to redo the whole thing, which would take a few years.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">Following on Deputy Kenny's earlier question, does the Taoiseach agree that part of the committee's remit should be to address some of the inconsistencies between the Irish and English language versions of the Constitution? Given that the Irish language version is the authoritative text legally, a referendum should not be required for this purpose. The minimum age of the President is one such inconsistency. One version indicates it is 34 years, while the other indicates it is 35 years. This and other inconsistencies can be rectified without resort to a referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Does the Taoiseach agree it is part of the Government's remit, rather than that of the committee, to act on the outcome of a referendum and take into account, for example, public support for an issue such as neutrality and, therefore, include it in the Constitution?</p>
          <p eId="para_70">I welcome the inclusion of Article 43 on the agenda. It seems extraordinary that for three decades since the 1973 Kenny report, builders have had such a hold over successive Governments in relation to Article 43 on private property.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">As regards the Constitution, as Deputy Rabbitte said, it seems as if there is a new document in the wings. Is there a greater need to monitor the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe given that it is intended by participants from other countries that there be a new constitution for the European Union? Is it not more important to focus on that as it is in formation and to ensure the all-party committee has a strong role in monitoring it?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_72">Deputy Sargent asked about two separate issues. I already said the property aspects are included in this and I have asked the committee to deal with it up front. The question of a new Constitution has already been dealt with and we will see how the committee works. At least there is a logical sequence which I can give the committee and I will do so at its January meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Valéry Giscard D'Estaing is the chairperson of the presidium and of the convention. He has stated that he thinks it more appropriate that we should have a new treaty, it would be too difficult to amend the existing treaties and that a comprehensive new treaty should be brought forward. That view is not shared by everybody. I do not have a difficulty with it but a lot depends on whether the Charter for Human Rights will be an annex to the treaty or part of it. I believe the argument will be that it should be part of the treaty. I see advantages in that, but I also see difficulties. The advantage is that there is a body of progressive and useful social legislation. Why should it not be in the treaty as it covers people's rights? The downside is that it could be interpreted as overriding other aspects of our Constitution. I can anticipate the lobbying from the other side on that. The Swedes have found a mechanism to deal with that whereby the full  charter is included and amendments are made. The charter stands unless an opposing view has been passed by the people and it has to be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Members will recall that when the charter was negotiated and agreed, it got political but not legal support. The ETUC in Europe is lobbying extensively for that document to be brought in as is the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and many individuals who believe these rights should be enhanced and included in the treaty. I do not believe I will oppose that view, but we will have to see how it goes.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">Does the Taoiseach accept there is a difficulty with this committee which has been up and running for a number of years and is generating a lot of work and more and more recommendations and reports but less action as time passes? There is a danger that pattern will continue. On the Government's approach, what is the Taoiseach's view on the appropriateness of considering a new Constitution in parallel with the other options he has outlined rather than leaving the idea of a new Constitution to the end of the process which will, invariably, take longer than he expects and that it should be taken up by the all-party committee for consideration? Significant time and energy was expended both by the committee and the Oireachtas on a constitutional amendment on abortion, which was ill-thought out and was rejected by the people. At the time three options were provided. The legislative route and the constitutional route were two options. The Government chose the latter and its justification for doing so was that there was a difficulty in regard to medical practice. Does the Taoiseach accept the difficulty still exists and it is not acceptable, politically or otherwise, to ignore it without considering the legislative route to deal with the outstanding issues, which were raised by the Government during the constitutional amendment debate but subsequently were not resolved by it?</p>

          <p eId="para_76">The Deputy raised two issues and I will deal with the second one first. She will recall the Government was committed to a Green Paper, preparing a position paper followed by a referendum and that process was undertaken. That resulted from a long process and the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, played its part. The Government followed a particular route that was rejected by the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The Deputy is correct that rejection did not change anything and the issue must be examined again. As she will be aware, there was enormous opposition to some of the proposals by people on different sides of the argument. The issue has not been resolved and I agree with her that it must be taken on at some stage again. The limbo continues and it will have to be taken up again. I am not sure when but the Minister for Health and  Children can take it up. We have debated the issue non-stop for five years and we need a rest from it for a while.</p>

One of my officials co-ordinates all the various questions that come up and I am taking it there are many more to go. Perhaps, as Deputy Rabbitte stated, an examination in the context of the totality of the Constitution is a better way. I would be glad to hear the committee's views.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">The major parties have agreed on most constitutional referenda down through the years and, if the work of the committee is to be implemented, there must be agreement between the major parties. The question is how this can be done legally and, even if it took a few more years to do it, it would be a job well worth doing. I assure the Deputy I have managed all the changes and work is available to see how we best finish them. We should address the remaining issues because there are many other difficult ones ahead. I am open to considering whether we should wait to deal with all of them together under a new Constitution or take them in blocks. I assure the Deputy the officials involved would like to take them collectively but they continue to point out that politicians must decide how best to have them passed, not them.</p>

It is probably the only issue that would be passed unanimously by people if put to a referendum. I agree with the Taoiseach all the other issues would be questioned but enshrining the rights of people with disabilities in the Constitution, including the right to a fair education, would meet with considerable support.</p>

There has been an enormous amount of legislative change, more than in any other period, and no doubt the issue of disability will come up for discussion again. The priority at the moment is to  have legislation which is acceptable to the various groups campaigning on the issue, and I hope we are near the end of that stage.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_87">I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Ireland believes that Security Council Resolution 1441, adopted unanimously, offers a genuine prospect of securing peaceful disarmament and avoiding war. The resolution is rigorous but fair in the demands it makes of Iraq. It offers the most likely means of achieving the three goals we set ourselves in our consideration of the current crisis, namely, to obtain Iraq's compliance with its disarmament obligations, to avoid a military conflict and to preserve the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Iraqi Government must fulfil in every respect the disarmament requirements which are unambiguously set out and fully co-operate with the UN inspectors. We are therefore pleased that the Iraqi Government has complied with the requirement to make a declaration by 8 December. This must now be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">The complete text of the Iraqi declaration contains sensitive information, including material on how to set about building weapons of mass destruction, and it was decided by the full Security Council that the text would only be seen by the weapons inspections teams and the permanent five, who possess the necessary expertise. This was intended to guard against leaks. Ireland is a very strong proponent of non-proliferation and we accept that the circulation of such information must be kept to a minimum. The material to be withheld by the inspectors will relate only to how such a capability could be built, it will not deal with whether Iraq has done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Ireland and the other members of the Security Council expect to see a revised version, with any sensitive material removed, in the next 24 to 48  hours. We expect to be given a clear picture by the inspectors of the extent and nature of any material which has had to be withheld. Equally we expect that all the members of the Security Council will be given complete access to any information required for them to fulfil their responsibility to determine whether Iraq has complied fully with its obligations under Resolution 1441. We have seen no evidence that undue political pressure will be put on the inspection teams. In any event, we have complete confidence in their integrity and professionalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">A preliminary report of the Iraqi declaration will be provided by the inspectors next week and a full discussion by the Security Council is expected to take place in January. It is most unlikely that this meeting would result in a definitive evaluation. Further reports from the arms inspectors to the Security Council are to be expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Our view is that Resolution 1441 lays down the procedures for assessing the question of Iraqi non-compliance. These require that a report of non-compliance by Iraq from the inspection teams must be considered by a further meeting of the Security Council. It is then for the Security Council alone to assess whether Iraq has failed to meet its obligations and to decide on action which may be required.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">What sources of independent assessment has the Minister identified to assist him and the Government in making a decision on whether Iraq has complied with the UN Security Council resolution? Has the Minister access to sources of information other than those of Governments which have taken up fixed positions on this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Why is it that Ireland chose not to seek to examine the documents? The Minister briefly mentioned that this would be left to the five permanent members of the Security Council. Will the Minister expand on the reasons for that decision? Could Ireland not have used other resources to assist it in assessing the documentation which the Security Council received?</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Is this not a further genuflection in the direction of the superiority, so to speak, of the five permanent members? Would the non-permanent members not have played a collective role in assessing this information? In the event of the Security Council taking a decision on whether the UN resolution has been breached, will the Minister come back and ensure that, by means of a debate in this House, he will assess the views of the representatives of the Irish people so that he will be well-informed on our response to any non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with the resolution?</p>

          <p eId="para_96">In answer to the first part of the Deputy's question we will be primarily relying on UNMOVIC and the IAEA who will report to the Security Council. They are the people charged with an assessment of the situation. We will defer  to them on this matter for an independent assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The question of the restricted distribution of the report in full was raised by the Deputy. The reason distribution has been restricted is to guard against the danger that sensitive information might be disclosed. Ireland participated in this decision which was taken by the full Security Council. We fully accept the need to take all necessary steps to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This does not in any way detract from our strongly-held belief that we should all be treated equally. We do not regard this very special case as a precedent. The decision has our approval. Quite apart from the details as to how a bomb is constructed, whether the Iraqis have or have not done so is an issue that will be brought to our attention. The nature and extent of any capacity that they have in that area will be brought to our attention by the inspection teams in their report. We do not have the capacity and expertise ourselves. We are non-proliferators and we do not believe that type of information should be widely available.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">In answer to the question about what action Ireland may take for the remainder of our tenure in the Security Council, that is a matter I am sure will be debated in the House at the appropriate time, based on the up to date information and assessment of what the Security Council will be considering at that stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_99">The Minister's answers to this question are unsatisfactory. If it was the case that there was sensitive information about the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction contained in the report, why could that matter not have been noted by the IAEA and a summary copy report made to all the members of the Security Council who are responsible for Resolution 1441? Does the Minister agree that the authority of the Security Council has been enormously damaged by restricting the circulation to the five permanent members? I ask the Minister to consider this position: a country like Ireland with a history of support for non-proliferation or other countries like it on the Security Council is regarded as a dangerous source even though it has been elected to the Security Council by a huge number of members of the United Nations. It is now not to be trusted with the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs who has a representative on the Security Council seems to be perfectly happy that the report has been given to the United States. Does the Minister therefore not see any damage done to the United Nations by the fact that two permanent members, Britain and the United States, have access to this document while our representative on the Security Council will be given an amended and edited version? Does the Minister think that this is assisting the process? I find it extraordinary that the Minister would think so. Why did the Minister wish to be on the Security Council? If he were canvassing  around the world today for votes would he say that we will only be there for certain matters and if any sensitive issue comes up such as something to do with nuclear weapons of mass destruction it must be vetted only by those who have such weapons? That is the logic of the Minister's position.</p>

This was a prudent decision in the context of avoiding the proliferation of information. I will emphasise two points: the IAEA and UNMOVIC have been given the full report and they will report to us. We will refer to them when it comes to assessing the independence of the evaluation. The extent and nature of the information will be made available to us by those who have the capacity and expertise to examine it and provide an independent report. They are the people to deal with it as has been defined in the Security Council resolution.</p>

We would be able to handle the sensitive material but it is a question of allowing those who have been given a task to do it. There are others like the P5 who have a nuclear capability who are in a position to give their views on that matter. We will listen to the IAEA and UNMOVIC in relation to this question. The Security Council decided to do it this way. If the charge of undermining the UN is applied to me it is applied to everyone on the Security Council and I do not accept that it is the intention or the consequence of this very special set of circumstances which arose in relation to some of the information in this report.</p>

      <b>Mr. G. Mitchell</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      his intended approach to closing the democratic deficit in relation to EU affairs.
      [26756/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_117">As recent experience has shown, if the European Union is to have the full confidence and support of its people it is vital that it be as accountable, transparent and accessible as possible. This is a question that needs to be addressed at both the European and the domestic level.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">At home, the Government has responded clearly to public concerns through the establishment of the National Forum on Europe to encourage debate on EU issues and through the introduction on 1 July 2002 of a new system of Oireachtas scrutiny of the Government's approach to EU negotiations. The new scrutiny arrangements provide the Oireachtas with an opportunity both to be informed and to express a view on EU negotiations at every stage from the tabling of proposals through to their eventual adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">We have also instituted, in agreement with the Oireachtas, a system of meetings between Ministers and Oireachtas committees in advance of Council meetings. I have, for instance, met the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on several occasions in recent months to brief the members and hear their views on issues arising on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. These meetings are now established as a valuable forum for dialogue on how the Government represents Ireland's interests in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The question of how to bring Europe closer to its citizens, as Deputies will be aware, is also one of the key issues being addressed at the European Convention. It is a complex question requiring a multi-faceted response.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">The convention is doing very important work on simplifying the Union's treaties, and legislative and procedural instruments, to make them more easily understood and accessible to the ordinary person. It also seeks to ensure that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are more meaningfully and effectively applied. The reports of the convention working groups on national parliaments and subsidiarity, for example, reflect a proposal tabled by Ireland and others to give national parliaments a role as subsidiarity watchdog, that is, to be in a position to have proposals reassessed if they do not properly respect the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">We have also suggested that, without creating a new institution, national parliaments, together with members of the European Parliament, might be given a role in the election of the President of the European Commission. It remains to be seen if the necessary support for this proposal can be achieved. However, we believe that the election of the President of the Commission – on which the European Commission and Benelux countries have also recently tabled interesting ideas – offers an important opportunity to bring that institution closer to Europe's citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">We in Ireland are particularly well placed to understand and advance the case for greater openness and accountability in the conduct of Union business, in Brussels and at home. We will continue to work to advance and support effective measures which can contribute to bridging the divide between the citizen and the Union.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_124">I acknowledge the work the Minister has done in taking the Labour Party's Bill through the Select Committee which had the co-operation of Fine Gael and other parties, in putting on a legislative footing the scrutiny powers and in being proactive in giving leadership to other Ministers by attending at committees. I express that because it is only fair and reasonable to do so. I hope the Minister will acknowledge that I have also tried to be fair and energetic in leading the Committee on European Affairs to do its business.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The Committee on European Affairs now has terms of reference and scrutiny powers. It has a  scrutiny sub-committee and it has some seconded staff. It has a very interested and committed membership and staff and it has the vehicle, through the powers given under the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill which the Minister put through the House. Is the Minister aware that that vehicle needs a little more juice if it is to work?</p>
          <p eId="para_126">In the near future there will be the scrutiny process, the enlargement and the Convention on the Future of Europe. There will be the ongoing forum, the intergovernmental conference which ultimately will come from the convention, the upcoming Presidency and a subsequent referendum. Taken with the concerns expressed at the convention and the forum about the democratic deficit, this indicates a major timetable for the House and its Committee on European Affairs in the two, three or four years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I expressed my appreciation of the Minister's assistance to date. I ask him to revisit the question of resources for the committee. We are not looking for the Taj Mahal. A hap'orth of tar could make this a very worthy ship. I ask the Minister to address that issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_69">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_128">I acknowledge the sentiments that the Deputy, as Chairman of the committee, has expressed. On average, there are some 200 draft legislative proposals per year which are subject to Oireachtas scrutiny. A significant proportion of these proposals are technical in nature and of less significance and are unlikely to be referred for detailed scrutiny. For example, since 1 July last, the Committee on European Affairs scrutiny sub-committee has decided that 18 out of a total of 72 draft legislative proposals should be referred to nine sectoral committees for more detailed consideration. I am glad the scrutiny sub-committee is making those decisions and deciding what is of real importance to us because some of these proposals are not of immediate or direct relevance.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The Government is conscious that resources are required to implement the new scrutiny arrangements effectively. In the meantime, in order to assist the Oireachtas, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs each allocated an officer at assistant principal level to assist the sub-committee in its work. Another officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to act as a policy adviser to the Committee on European Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">As the Deputy will be aware, the Oireachtas will shortly be in a position to make its own decisions on the allocation of resources when the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill, which is currently awaiting to proceed through Committee Stage in this House, is enacted. I hope when it is enacted everyone in this House will recognise that the statutory responsibility for the European Union business, which has been given to the committee to which the Deputy refers, is entitled to  get particular consideration in the outcome of those deliberations.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_132">In giving permission for foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the State, the Government is acting under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, which allows the Minister for Foreign Affairs to grant permission to overfly or land in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">In the case of routine landings, confirmation is required that the aircraft is unarmed, does not carry arms, ammunition or explosives and does not form part of a military exercise or operation. Foreign military aircraft meeting these conditions have been granted permission to refuel at Shannon over a period of decades, under successive Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The Deputy will also be aware of the decision, on an exceptional basis, to provide landing and refuelling facilities for foreign military aircraft pursuant to the State's obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1368. This decision was adopted in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. I am keeping these arrangements under review, in the light of progress achieved in the campaign against al-Qaeda and its Taliban protectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The question of landings of civilian aircraft carrying military personnel is a separate matter governed by civil aviation regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">I do not wish to speculate as to the conditions which will apply in the event of military action against Iraq. It is the view of the Government that any such action should be authorised by the UN Security Council. The Government believes diplomatic means continue to offer the best hope of resolving the current situation. We believe that every possible effort should be made to avoid the use of military force, which could have grave repercussions for the stability of the region. I am certain any decision to use force against Iraq and Ireland's position in regard to such a development will be fully debated by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">As regards granting overflight or landing permission, the Government's policy will be determined by our firm attachment to the United Nations and will take full account of the political circumstances applying at the time should that happen. Moreover, the House may rest assured that the Government will act in full accordance with our constitutional and legal obligations.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">Unfortunately the Minister did not answer the question directly. Is he aware that there is a debate raging in Germany at present  about this very issue? Germany is a member of NATO. It is discussing whether it should allow the Americans to use its airspace and airports, yet Ireland, as a so-called neutral country, cannot give a guarantee that it will not use our airports and our airspace in the event of not having a UN mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Does the Minister consider that a false declaration by Iraq would constitute the grounds for military action against it? Could he indicate which section of the UN Charter allows for a military attack in such circumstances? I have put it very clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Would the Minister agree that this needs to come before this House, as it did in 1990? There are precedents. It is vital – I hope the Minister agrees with me on this – that it comes before this House and is debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Is the Minister aware that there were polls published to indicate that the Irish people are opposed to US unilateral action in this regard? How can he justify giving the airport access?</p>

          <p eId="para_144">Where is there a reference in the UN Charter to justifying an attack on the basis of a threat? Is the Minister aware that we have already had a situation where the US, I think, condemned the attack in Suez in 1956 by the British, the Israelis and the French on the grounds that it could not be launched simply on the basis of a threat? I hope the Minister will agree that this latest threatened attack would be in clear breach of the UN Charter if it goes ahead, and I ask him to outline the Irish position.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_145">I am not prepared to speculate on the possible events outlined by the Deputy on the basis that we are working extremely hard to ensure we have a peaceful resolution of this problem. The view of the Government is that any prospective military action should be authorised by the UN Security Council. Regarding the possibility of debate on this issue, I have already stated that I am certain that any decision to use force against Iraq and Ireland's position in regard to such developments will be fully debated in this House. I have given a clear reply in relation to all of these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Regarding whether a false declaration will lead to a military response authorised by the UN Security Council, it will be a matter for the Security Council to determine whether a material breach has occurred. A material breach would encompass not only inaccurate information but also a continuing failure to comply with existing resolutions, as set out in paragraphs four and 14. I have already explained what the Government  believes to be the proper legal interpretation in relation to all of these matters. It is a matter for the Security Council to decide on the appropriate action in the event of a report of the inspectors confirming that they are not receiving co-operation or are being denied the opportunity to fulfil their mandate from the Security Council. On all of these matters there is a position and procedure set out within the resolution, and the Government has clearly stated its position on them.</p>

The link to the debate on the future of Europe, for example, links to the portal of the European Union, as well as to the portal for the Convention on the Future of Europe. In addition, selecting a thematic issue on the homepage, such as human rights, provides links to the UN High Commission for Human Rights and the International Court of Justice. For convenience, the links which are spread throughout the website are now also available together on the main links page. This page includes links to the UN and EU bodies, as well as links to other Departments and to foreign ministries of EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">It is intended that the website will be assessed and reviewed early in the new year with a view to making it more effective and to take account of advances in technology since the site was initially designed.

Any future sites to be launched by the Department will contain links relevant to the work in question. For example, the proposed website for Ireland Aid will contain links to development related websites, organisations in donor countries and multilateral organisations.

      <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the progress made in the Security Council's consideration of the Iraqi arms dossier; if, as members of the UN Security Council, Ireland has received a copy of the dossier; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_158">The declaration required under Security Council Resolution 1441 was presented by the Iraqi Government to the weapons inspections teams in Baghdad on 7 December. We are pleased that the Iraqi Government has complied with the requirement to make a declaration by 8 December. This has now to be examined. The declaration and annexed material is some 12,000 pages long, a large number of which are in Arabic.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The declaration is currently being studied by the inspections teams, as well as by experts among the permanent five members of the Security Council. The head of the inspections teams, Dr. Blix, will provide a preliminary assessment of the declaration later this week. Ireland and the other members of the Security Council expect to see an abridged version, with any sensitive material removed, in the next 24 to 48 hours.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_160">Would the Minister agree that this move completely undermines the credibility of the UN? The ostensible reason for having this abridged version – that sensitive material could fall into the wrong hands and be used by rogue states – is nonsense. The real reason, as given by a UN official himself, is that there is trepidation among the major powers about revealing the  names of Baghdad's former weapons suppliers. This is about censorship. What does the Minister, as someone who lobbied very hard to gain us membership of the Security Council, have to say about this? I am not satisfied with the answer he gave to Deputy Higgins earlier. I want a more positive response from the Minister that admits this has been a very bad day indeed for the UN.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_161">I replied in detail to this on Priority Questions. I do not accept that the permanent members of the Security Council have sought to undermine the credibility of the Security Council. We are non-proliferators of this type of information. How to make an atomic weapon is not the type of information that should be available to everybody and anybody whenever they want it.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">We rely on the inspection teams to issue a report to the Security Council. Hans Blix and Mohammed El Baradei will provide us with an independent and fair assessment of the situation on behalf of the UN secretariat and Security Council. That is their mandate. They will also be able inform us on the nature and extent of the abridged information not already brought to our attention for the reasons I have given. Whatever about the detail of how to make a nuclear weapon, if the Iraqis have one we will know about it. This does not undermine the credibility of the UN.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The UN inspection teams are beginning to inspect this voluminous report, much of which is in Arabic. They must be given time to assess it. There will be a preliminary assessment next week, and I am sure further meetings will follow next month when the inspectors have got through the whole dossier.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">It is incorrect to suggest that the UN Security Council is not doing its job. The inspection teams have my full confidence. They are going through the dossier methodically and when they report I will listen very carefully to what they have to say. We will put any questions we may have and obtain any other information we may seek as a result of the inspectors' assessment. Let us take this step by step.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">By whom and with whose authority has the abridgement of the report been done, and is the Minister satisfied that these judgments are being made with absolute independence? Will the Minister comment on the fact that British and American sources stated that the report was inadequate within a day or two of having received it, when it is possible they may not have been able to read it properly? They were already indicating a prejudice not to accept the report's adequacy. Does the Minister consider such apparently premature comments helpful or does he agree they are not and that everybody, including the British and the Americans, should forbear from any comment on the report until they have thoroughly studied it?</p>

          <p eId="para_166">I cannot understand the logic of the Minister's last answer. He said the Security Council, of which Ireland is a member, is willing to wait for the report of the inspector's team. He has my support on that. Why can everybody not wait? On what basis was the report given to one permanent member of the council? I do not understand the continual reference to the report being in Arabic. In what other language would it have been written? Will the Minister answer the point made by Deputy Gormley? Is it not the case that many of the members of the Security Council, some permanent members, supplied Iraq until 1991 with materials that would be in violation of the current resolution? That is the reason the public sees this as, in effect, censorship of the report. I want the report to go to everybody and I want everybody to wait.</p>

Does he agree with the assessment of the Iraqis that this represents an unprecedented extortion in the history of the UN? That is how they described it.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">My assessments will not be based on the views of interested parties. The UN inspection teams will influence me more directly than anybody in Iraq, for obvious reasons. People cannot have it both ways. One either has confidence in the inspection teams or one does not. The inspection teams will report to the Security Council and I await their report.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The report was not given to only one of the permanent five members, all five permanent members obtained it, and they have the capacity to examine and evaluate it in so far as they wish to do so. The elected ten will await the inspection teams' report. That was agreed as the way this would be done. I agree with Deputy Bruton that there should not be a premature assessment of what is clearly a voluminous amount of documentation. Everybody knows there are elements in the administrations who have a certain view on this, regardless of what efforts are made by the United Nations. That will not deflect me or the Government from upholding our position, which is to await the considered assessment by the inspection teams of these matters. We await their preliminary assessment next week and will proceed from there.</p>

      <b>Mr. G. Mitchell</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      if the General Affairs and External Relations Council of the EU considered the recent riots in Nigeria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [26499/02]

        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_171">The recent riots in Nigeria were not discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10  December. However, the overall stability and security of Nigeria continues to be closely monitored by the Council at working group level and by EU embassies in Abuja.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">The riots, which started in the northern city of Kaduna and spread as far south as the federal capital, Abuja, were provoked by an ill-advised article in a national newspaper which suggested that the Prophet Mohammed would have approved of the Miss World contest, which was due to be held in Nigeria. Accounts of the rioting suggest that it was orchestrated and targeted, with local offices of the newspaper being burned down and Christian churches attacked. Reprisals followed, with mosques being targeted by local Christian youths. In total, more than 200 people died as a result of the sectarian violence. The Irish embassy in Abuja was in regular contact with the Miss World contestants representing Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Inter-communal violence is a serious problem in Nigeria and more than 10,000 people have died in ethnic and religious clashes since the return of democracy in 1999. The Nigerian police force, which was grossly neglected under military rule, has found itself unable to respond adequately to the fighting which regularly erupts around the country. The perceived absence of law and order has led to the formation of vigilante groups in parts of the country. President Obasanjo has acted to counter this rise in vigilantism through the adoption of the Prohibition of Certain Associations Act, 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">In May 2002, the EU renewed its common position on Nigeria. The common position notes with concern the rise in political, ethnic and religious violence in the country and the considerable challenges faced by the Government of Nigeria in the areas of security and human rights. Support for institutional capacity building is identified as a key area where the EU can support a democratic culture in Nigeria, specifically through the re-professionalisation of the military and disbanding of paramilitary groups; reform of the police, judiciary and penal systems; and support to Nigeria's capacity to anticipate and prevent internal conflicts. The common position also identifies the elaboration of a poverty reduction strategy by the Nigerian Government as well as economic growth as other key areas which would contribute to Nigeria's development. To help achieve these aims, the EU has committed funds of €552 million in the period from 2001 to 2007.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">The Minister referred to vigilante groups in Nigeria. Is he aware of concerns expressed by Amnesty International about the poor morale of the police force and its inability to uphold the law in many parts of Nigeria? Is he further aware that, in the states of Anambra and Imo, vigilante groups known as Bakassi Boys have been approved by the regional Government or regional assemblies and, far from being discouraged, these groups have the formal support  of those whom we would normally expect to uphold the rule of law through the normal police, judicial and legislative processes? Will the Minister ensure that the concerns of Amnesty International in this regard are raised on the next occasion the General Affairs Council considers the situation in Nigeria and will he also communicate these concerns to our ambassador in Lagos?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_179">I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 51 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The Government remains concerned about the situation in West Papua, in particular the human rights situation there. I am also aware of the questions addressed in a recently published book on the circumstances surrounding the 1969 Act of Free Choice in West Papua. Ireland was not a party to the 1969 Act. The question of a possible UN review of the Act would be a matter for the UN secretariat and the UN Secretary General, and it is our understanding that they do not intend to re-open the issue. Procedurally, any re-opening would also require the support of UN member states and our mission to the UN informs us that there appears to be no significant support for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">There is also a concern that such a review might prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Government authorities in Jakarta and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the West Papuan people. In this respect, of primary concern to the Government are the reports of ongoing human rights abuses in West Papua and, in particular, continuing allegations of military and police involvement in such violations.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The EU is developing a political dialogue with the Indonesian Government, which includes a focus on human rights issues. In pursuit of this, a team of EU ambassadors visited West Papua in March of this year and, while there, met leading human rights groups, representatives of the Catholic and Protestant churches, members of the West Papua Presidium Council and tribal leaders,  as well as Government representatives and military commanders. We hope this dialogue will grow and develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">EU Foreign Ministers are due to discuss the EU's relations with Indonesia next month. The meeting is expected to address issues such as judicial and legal reforms and the limited progress to date in the area of respect for human rights. Deputies can be assured that the Government will continue to monitor these issues closely.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_184">Why does the Government not take an initiative in the Security Council in relation to West Papua? Does the Minister accept that the so-called Act of Free Choice of 1969 was processed through the collusion of the United Nations and that the United Nations has direct responsibility in this regard? If a dialogue on human rights is being constructed with the Indonesian authorities, I presume the Minister is also pressing for the release of the tribal leaders and others who are currently imprisoned in Indonesia. Does he accept the view offered by a retired senior United Nations official that the so-called act of free choice in 1969 was a rigged process forced on the people of West Papua? Why is he not taking an initiative on the Security Council to seek to undo it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_185">I am aware of the recent publication by Dr. John Saltford on the role of the United Nations in the Indonesian take-over of West Papua. He researched the history of West Papua and the act of free choice as well as the role of the international community in the hand-over of the former Dutch colony to Indonesia. He questions whether the West Papuan people genuinely exercised the right to self-determination guaranteed to them in the UN-brokered Dutch-Indonesian agreement of 1962.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The work of the West Papua action group has also been brought to my attention. There is regular contact between its members and the officials of my Department. I welcome, in particular, such sharing of information and all meetings that can inform our approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">As I pointed out in my reply, procedurally one requires not alone the initiative of the Secretary General and the Secretariat but significant support from the member states of the UN which is not, apparently, there at present. I will bring the matter to the attention of their representation to see if this is an issue on which we could be more proactive.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I suggest to the Deputy that perhaps after next month's discussion on EU relations with Indonesia, I can go into more detail on this matter during a future Question Time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_189">Is the Minister aware that of central concern to the West Papua action group is that there be a review of the United Nations' actions and involvement in what transpired? It is not so much the decision as the UN's involve ment. Usually in this House the United Nations is spoken of in glowing terms in regard to its high principled approach. It would seem that in the case of West Papua the usual terms of operation do not apply. A review of the UN's actions and involvement there is urgently required. Will the Minister address this issue during a future Question Time when he has discussed the matter further at the General Affairs Council?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_190">As I have said, this is a matter that cannot be dealt with by this country alone. There is a requirement for sufficient support for such a move to take place. The question has been asked as to what can we do from here on. I have indicated that I will discuss with the representation in the United Nations what we can do to assist the situation in terms of making sure that any injustice that was caused to the West Papuan people might be addressed in some way. Clearly if an injustice was done it would be a matter of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">One must respect the territorial integrity of Indonesia. There is also a need to ensure that in promoting decentralisation and greater autonomy for the regions in Indonesia, we do not bring about a situation that would cause greater instability. I hear what the Deputies are saying and confess that their questions were the first indication I have had of any cause for concern in regard to West Papua. I will endeavour to see what can be done. The future EU discussion on Indonesia will provide a basis for further examination of the subject at a later stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I appreciate the Minister's frankness in admitting that he will now take a proactive stance following these questions. He indicated that the group has been in contact with his Department. Why was that insufficient to activate the Minister's interest in this matter? Why is it that there is no support among UN members? Has the Minister asked the Security Council members why they are not interested in taking a more proactive role on this issue?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_193">As I said to the Deputy, the indications we received from the representation, and from the body of information available to me in this reply, simply stated the fact that sufficient support is not currently available to move the matter along. I cannot give any greater detail at present but I will try to obtain more information for the Deputies and let them know in a supplementary reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The information sharing that has taken place at an official level is for the purpose of making sure we are aware of the positions being taken by interested groups. In terms of dealing with the matter procedurally at the UN, it remains that one requires the support of the Secretariat and a wide involvement by the member states which is not currently available. We will return to this matter on another occasion.</p>

      <b>Mr. P. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the Government's priorities in relation to Central and South America.
      [26510/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_198">As the political and economic importance of the Latin American region continues to grow, the focus of our policy towards Central and South America is to build closer bilateral relations with the countries of the region and, together with our partners in the European Union, to forge a closer bi-regional relationship with Latin America as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The bi-regional relationship between the European Union and Latin America was given a further impetus by the second Summit of Heads of State and Government of the EU and Latin America and the Caribbean, which took place in Madrid on 17 May last. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to consolidate the strategic partnership between the two regions based on respect for human rights and international law, the promotion of democracy and co-operation for economic and social development. Ireland will jointly chair the third EU-Latin America/ Caribbean summit, which is expected to take place in Mexico in May 2004, during the Irish Presidency of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Ireland has supported the negotiation of the new EU association and partnership agreements with individual countries and regional blocs in Latin America. A global agreement on economic partnership, political co-operation and co-ordination between the EU and Mexico came into effect on 1 July 2000. The global agreement provides a framework for the development of Ireland's political and economic relations with Mexico. The rapid development of these relations is evidenced by the fact that the first visit by a President of Mexico took place on 13 November last, when we were very happy to welcome President Fox who was accompanied by an important business delegation. The Taoiseach will make an official visit to Mexico next month. A substantial trade delegation will also travel with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Following more than two years of negotiations, a comprehensive association agreement between the EU and Chile was signed on 18 November 2002. It provides for co-operation in the political, economic, scientific, technological, social and cultural fields. Ireland welcomes the increased opportunities for bilateral co-operation to be provided by the agreement which will further strengthen our ties with Chile, already advanced significantly this year by their opening of a resident embassy in Dublin. Negotiations are also proceeding for a new EU-Mercosur association agreement. We will seek to build bilaterally on  the Taoiseach's visit to Brazil last year when President Lula da Silva's administration takes office on 1 January next.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Ireland's trade with, and investment in, Latin America as a whole have increased substantially in recent years. Between 1995 and 2001, total trade with the region grew from €543 million to €1.84 billion and we look forward to a similar expansion in trade in the coming years. A number of Irish companies have made significant investments in Latin America including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">We are also developing our relations with Latin America through increased Ireland Aid funding to the region. To date, in 2002, Ireland Aid has provided over €6.1 million to countries in Latin America under the human rights and democratisation scheme, the NGO co-financing scheme and in the form of emergency and rehabilitation assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The Government is fully seized of the fact that Latin America as a whole is a region of immense potential. Accordingly, Ireland's diplomatic representation in the area has been steadily strengthened over recent years. In addition to the long-standing embassy in Buenos Aires, which also holds accreditation to Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay, and the opening of an embassy in Mexico city in 1999, with secondary accreditation to Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Peru and Venezuela, a resident embassy was established in Brasilia in November 2001. In an agreed programme for Government we committed to further expanding our resident diplomatic missions in Latin America, as elsewhere, resources permit.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_205">Does the Minister agree that €6.1 million is a small amount of aid for a region of such enormous geographic size and great need? Even in some of the more developed parts of southern and Central America there is great need. In the context of increased aid to the region, will the Minister inform the House if human rights in parts of the region has been high on the Government's agenda and will continue to be so? I refer, in particular, to the number of disappearances and the taking of hostages.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">I understand that in Ecuador recently an Irish citizen was taken captive, and may still be held. The Minister did not say who is the accredited ambassador to Ecuador. I believe the ambassador to Mexico has been involved in the case. Has the Government raised in general the question of persons being abducted for ransom and specifically the case of an Irish citizen?</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Regarding development aid, we have obtained a good peer review internationally. There is specific emphasis on Africa in terms of our Ireland Aid programmes and giving to the  poorest of the poor. There are areas of Latin America which are also very deprived and we have provided for some assistance in that area. We note what the Deputy said regarding the amount of money involved. Clearly we have to prioritise but in the context of a growing volume of money being made available for development aid for the future, this is an issue and an area of activity that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, can take up based on our discussions here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">On the second question, there are far too many instances of human rights abuses, lawlessness, kidnapping, etc. throughout the continent of Latin America, specifically in certain areas. I am aware of the case raised by Deputy Mitchell and the family concerned. We are continuing to do all we can to discharge our consular responsibilities to citizens, particularly in regard to the case mentioned by the Deputy where we are continuing to try to obtain a successful outcome to what has been a very difficult situation for the family.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">They refer to the decision on 21 November of the 19 NATO member states meeting in Prague at the level of Heads of State and Government to extend an invitation to seven states from Eastern Europe and the Baltic region to join NATO. All of the invited states had been actively pursuing the goal of NATO membership for some years and had tailored their involvement in Partnership for Peace to the extent of following specific mem bership action plans, particular only to states wishing to join NATO.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Once the lengthy accession process which requires parliamentary ratification of the decision by all existing NATO members is completed, the number of non-NATO countries participating in PfP will fall from 27 to 20.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">From Ireland's perspective, a key aspect is that no change to the underlying principles for PfP is envisaged. The core principle of self-differentiation will continue to apply, whereby each country participates according to its own interests and priorities. Ireland will continue to benefit from experience being gained in peacekeeping, especially through the development of enhanced interoperability which is improving our ability to undertake peacekeeping operations in a safe and effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The role of the neutral and non-aligned participants in PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, such as Ireland, Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland, will continue to be important in shaping its future. I reiterate that I do not foresee circumstances in which Ireland would wish to join NATO.</p>

Will he agree that if we do not do that, it will be like economic and monetary union – we will join later on the basis of rules made by others? In that regard, does the Minister share my concern that, unlike other neutral states, Ireland has not provided to defend its own neutrality and therefore we have rendered ourselves very vulnerable? Far from being shy of participating in these discussions, we should bring forward our own suggestions and ideas for the future security of Ireland and Europe.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_221">Two different points are being made by both Deputies. To take Deputy Gormley's point, it should not be regarded as inevitable that the future architecture of European security and defence policy in the European Union should be shaped by NATO. They are two distinct operations with different mandates and in order for a consensus to be maintained in the SDP area we have to take cognisance of the specific character of member states in relation to the area of military involvement and policy. That has been accommodated thus far in the Treaty of Nice and I hope that the outcome of the deliber ations he is having on the defence policy committee of the convention will ensure that the hard-won benefits we have obtained in Nice will be upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The point made by Deputy Mitchell is that he wishes to see us engage. We are prepared to constructively engage in terms of defence policy arrangements for the future of the European Union in a way which is consistent with our foreign policy traditions. Perhaps that is not a view shared unanimously throughout the House but there is a recognition by all of us here that it is an area in which we need to be engaged and seek to influence. We can find a niche and a full role for our military in areas of activity which are consistent with the areas in which we have an ability to contribute. If we approach the issue in that light, we have every prospect of obtaining an outcome with which we can be happy and which will be satisfactory in all the circumstances.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_226">Every Member of the House will support measures to increase safety on the roads and prevent accidents and deaths. Following the announcement by the Minister for Transport yesterday, is it intended to enforce the regulations, in so far as provisional licence holders are concerned, from 1 January? Is this not a case of putting the cart before the horse in that there is no real plan or agenda by Government to deal with the issue of the 45% failure rate of driving tests? Inconsistency applies between centres for driving tests, for instance, between Sligo and Clonmel. There is a complete lack of regulation in respect of driving instructors and driving instructor schools and inadequate provision of driving instruction being incorporated in second level schools where driving instruction should be of critical importance, as it is for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The thousands of people who want to do the driving test but who have to wait six and eight months to do so will now find themselves outside the law if they attempt to drive to and from work or school and if nobody is available to travel with them, they will have to get a taxi, hire a hackney or not travel at all. Is it intended to implement all of these regulations from 1 January and will the Government, in implementing these road safety measures, take these issues into account? What progress is the Government making towards decreasing the time individuals have to wait for their driving tests?</p>

          <p eId="para_228">From 1 January, anyone driving must carry his or her driving licence regardless of whether he or she holds a full or provisional driving licence. The Minister hopes to progressively implement a number of the penalties for infringements under the penalty points system. The law says provisional licence holders must be accompanied by a full licence holder when driving. The Minister hopes to link this into the penalty points system.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Minister proposes to establish a new agency – this may require legislation – to deal with the regulation of driving instructors and the related matters raised by Deputy Kenny. The Government is conscious of the number of people who do not hold full licences. If all are to be adequately able to take their driving test, changes must be made. The Minister will make an announcement in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">Is the Taoiseach aware that statistics show the most dangerous drivers to be those who have passed their tests within the previous six months? Does the Government intend to give drivers who pass their tests restricted driving condition plates for the first 12 months of holding a full licence? Will the driving test be reformed? It has not been reformed in the past 25 years. Will the Government see to it that the result sheet given to those who fail their driving test is legible? In reviewing this, will the Taoiseach take into account the detailed analysis and constructive proposals produced two and a half years ago in a document compiled by Deputies Naughten and Coveney? The document dealt with driving instruction in secondary schools and related road safety issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I understand research shows the most dangerous drivers to be those who hold provisional licences. I recall this being discussed in Cabinet some months ago and that was the impression I got. I am open to correction on it. All these proposals are built around an effort by the Government to both strengthen and implement the road safety legislation. We published a strategy document on this three or four years ago. The proposals will be implemented and the points system will be phased in over a period.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_233">Will the Taoiseach tell the House why the Minister for Transport has suppressed the report of the taxi hardship panel? Two years ago the taxi licensing system was deregulated. Following that, it was admitted that there were a number of hard cases in the immediate transfer. Unfortunately, some people had purchased plates immediately prior to deregulation, others were relying on the sale of the plate for their pensions and widows of taxi drivers were left stranded. All of this happened because of the manner in which Fianna Fáil had led taxi drivers up the hill and then down again.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Deputy Callely fought their case and brought them to Government Buildings. The Taoiseach set up a forum, put his arm around the taxi leaders and told them it would be all right on the night. A judge made a ruling and the Progressive Democrats saw an opportunity to claim the  decision as its own. A taxi hardship panel was then established to bring Fianna Fáil over the election period. The Minister told the House on 16 October that he had received the report and would announce his decision in due course. Nothing has happened since. Women connected with some of the most seriously affected drivers went to Brussels last week to make their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">What is in the report of the taxi hardship panel? Why can the House not be made aware of what is in it? When will the scheme and its terms be announced? Those involved had relied on having compensation before Christmas, but more than two years have now elapsed. The Minister must have found the report to be uncongenial and is not making it public. Judging from the mirth running along the depleted Cabinet Benches it has been discussed at Cabinet. The rest of us should be told what it includes and maybe then we can share in the fun. Many taxi drivers and their families do not find it funny.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">Deputy Rabbitte has outlined what has happened over the past two years. There were 3,000 taxi licences but now there are 12,000. Within those 3,000 licence holders there were people who had borrowed to buy the licence and widows who had rented them to earn an income. The Government agreed to establish an independent group to look at the cases put forward by the taxi representative groups and draw up a scheme to assist those who had suffered real hardship. The group met in February or March and has recently reported to the Minister. The Minister will publish the report but wants to find a mechanism to put in place the structures for payments. He has recently appointed a taxi regulator and that was widely welcomed in the industry. The regulator will be charged with implementing the terms of the hardship panel. I understand the report is to be published before Christmas.</p>

Clearly, it is to be hived off to a regulator. I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Callely is not resigning his post and taking over that of regulator of taxis.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_241">Is it not the case that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, provided that service for years, that he misled the taximen and led them over the abyss with the connivance of the Taoiseach who told them it would not happen? Then the courts dropped them in it and even the  Progressive Democrats – Bobby Molloy having set up the committee – admit there are hardship cases. I refer to people genuinely in plight who remortgaged their homes to pay for a plate, widows who were left in a state of penury and people who were ill and were relying on the sale of the plate to retire on a pension. These are hard facts that even the Progressive Democrats admit are the case. Is it not the case that on 16 October the Minister told the House that he was taking the report to the Cabinet? Why must some citizen be found to accept the role of regulator and dispense the largesse? If there was largesse, the Minister, Deputy Brennan would be the first to announce it and to play Santa Claus. Where is he?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_123">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I am glad Deputy Rabbitte shares my concern and that of the Tánaiste about people who suffered as a result of this. Some 3,000 taxi people took to the streets two years ago. Every year at this time I answer questions here about the plight of the hard-pressed citizen who cannot get a taxi. Deputy Rabbitte was correct in saying that I set up a forum and sought to obtain an additional 800 licences. He was also correct in saying that the courts moved on that and we now have an additional 9,000 taxis, although I would have been satisfied with an additional 800 only a few years ago. All those developments have taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Some people were financially caught as a result of these developments. We obtained an independent report which assesses this matter. The person who completed the report met everyone concerned, including the representatives of all the taxi groups and the representatives of FARE, the group of women representing taxi people, to whom Deputy Rabbitte referred. While it is one matter to issue a report, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, wanted to develop a process. It is not the Government's intention to change the report. We accept its proposals and it is intended to implement them as quickly as possible. A regulator who will be appointed early in new year will take on that task.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">Is that not where Deputy Higgins had his fundraising event for the last election, in Dingle?</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Of the top 400 earners' cases examined in 2002, 117 had an effective tax rate of less than 30%, 231 had an effective tax rate of between 30% and 44% and 52 had an effective tax rate of 45%. That study, to which Deputy Higgins referred, indicates there is an increase in the effective tax rate of high earners in the year under review, a part of the study to which the Deputy omitted to refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I have no responsibility for what a private sector company does. If Deputy Higgins is asking me to give my view, it seems extraordinary that somebody would get a severance package as high as that reported. I presume those figures are correct. I do not know the basis of that package or what the arrangements were. If the Deputy is asking me to share a view with him that the severance package seems an extraordinary large amount of money, I agree with that statement.</p>

Can we hope that, in the quiet of the seasonal break as the Taoiseach tends his hanging baskets or munches on mince pies, the Government will resolve to give up its auld sins and quit pandering especially to the private greed of that narrow sector of society who wants to get its hands on crucial public assets to make a killing rather than to serve the public interest?</p>

They always showed great care and regard for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">With regard to privatisation, the policy of the Government is to deal with relevant issues on a case by case basis and to discuss them with the  trade union movement, organised labour and the workforce generally, regardless of whether its members are members of a union. We will discuss such issues to ascertain the strategic interests of the company concerned, taking into account the public good, the welfare of the staff and the strategic alliances of the company. There is not an ideological reason for such an approach. We privatised companies in recent years that were broken, bust and on the road to closing down and we also privatised companies that were of good value and use. We will continue on that basis. There are no specific proposals as of yet, but we will continue with that policy. The workforce, unions and organised labour want the Government to continue with it and there is no reason other than that. I have already dealt with Eircom.</p>

The farming community was given an assurance some time ago that levies would be slashed if it paid for the round test. Farmers now have to pay for the round test and the levies. This is another stealth tax. The farming community, already depressed, is being hit by a further €10 million annually for disease levies. The scheme has only managed to contain the disease at around 30,000 head per annum. As a result, some €445 million of farmers' money has been pumped into an unsuccessful scheme. I, therefore, oppose the taking of No. 10 without debate, as Deputy Timmins signalled at the committee.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_246">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_415">I attended the Copenhagen European Council on Thursday and Friday, 12 and 13 December. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs. The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before both Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">"Historic" is a word that is much overused. Those of us who engage in politics are perhaps  particularly guilty of the overuse of this most valuable word. Of all the European Council meetings I have attended, both as Taoiseach and as Minister for Finance, the Copenhagen European Council is the one of which the word "historic" can be used without fear of contradiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Last weekend marked a watershed in the history of Europe. In Copenhagen, the leaders of the existing member states of the European Union and the leaders of the ten applicant countries brought to a conclusion enlargement negotiations which mark a quantum leap in the development of European unity. In welcoming the new member states into the European Union, over seven years of protracted and detailed negotiations have been brought to a successful conclusion. We have also given a clear signal on behalf of our peoples that Europe is determined to be united as a zone of peace, prosperity and freedom. This is a moment for celebration. Europe has given concrete expression to the aspirations of centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I am confident that the ten accession states will ratify the Treaty of Accession and that Ireland as President in Office of the European Council will welcome the new member states into the European Union on 1 May 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Enlargement will pose significant challenges for Europe and for Ireland. In Europe's case, the procedures, structures and policies of the Union will have to cope with the largest intake of new member states since its foundation. I have no doubt that further significant reforms and changes will be required at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference if Europe is to remain effective. Ireland will be active in promoting such reforms while remaining vigilant to ensure that the essential balances which underpin the European Union are not endangered.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">For Ireland, the challenges posed by enlargement are also significant. We will no longer be the second smallest member state. We are, in addition, becoming one of the richest member states. As such, our approach to European negotiations must continue to evolve and become more focused. In order to advance our core national interests we will need to continue to build alliances with the new member states while deepening and strengthening our alliances with the existing members. We will need to identify our national priorities with care and pursue them with dogged determination. I am confident that Ireland can succeed in the enlarged Europe and I intend to ensure that European policy continues to be a central priority for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The main business at the European Council was the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations. As is always the case with such negotiations, difficult compromises were required on all sides. The result is, however, a good one for Europe and a good one for Ireland. While additional resources were made available to the accession states, the core elements of the agreement on funding reached at the Brussels European Council last October remain in place. In  particular, the agreement on agricultural expenditure reached at Brussels remains. We can now look forward to welcoming Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia into the European Union. The accession treaty will be signed in Athens on 16 April next. We will be joined by 75 million new European Union citizens from 1 May 2004. I am happy to say that it will fall to Ireland's Presidency to formally welcome the new member states into the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Ireland will be forging ever closer ties with the accession countries from now on and I look forward to visiting the Czech Republic and welcoming the Prime Ministers of Poland and Estonia to Dublin in the new year. These are amongst the range of bilateral contacts that members of the Government will have with our future partners in the lead up to our Presidency in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The European Union has completed negotiations with Cyprus and it will be admitted as a new member state to the European Union. Nevertheless, we confirm the strong preference for accession by a united Cyprus. We welcome the commitment of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to continue negotiations with a view to concluding a comprehensive settlement by the end of next February on the basis of proposals presented by the United Nations General Secretary, Kofi Annan. We encourage the leaders of both sides to seize this historic opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The European Council confirmed that the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania will continue. The objective is to welcome these two countries as members of the European Union in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">If the European Council decides in December 2004, on the basis of an EU Commission report, that Turkey fulfils the political criteria for membership of the European Union, accession negotiations will open without delay. The decision on Turkey balances the incentive of a timeframe in which its application for membership will be considered and the need to fulfil the criteria for membership of the European Union. The new Government in Turkey has shown that it is willing to take the necessary steps to meet the criteria which were established for European Union membership almost ten years ago. The European Union, for its part, will strengthen its pre-accession strategy for Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The European Council also confirmed its determination to support the efforts by the countries in the Western Balkans, including Albania, Croatia and the former Republic of Yugoslavia, to move closer to the European Union while respecting the political criteria set down for membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The Greek Presidency will organise a summit next June between EU member states and the countries of the stabilisation and association process. The European Union will also work to enhance its relations with Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and the southern Mediterranean  countries based on a long-term approach promoting democratic and economic reforms. The overall aim is to ensure that the enlarged European Union is a force for stability and progress within and beyond its borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">On the issue of the functioning of the Presidency of the Council in the wake of enlargement, the European Council took note of an initial report from the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The European Council also marked a major breakthrough in relation to European Security and Defence Policy. Berlin Plus relates to the arrangements whereby the EU can have access to NATO's assets and resources for the Petersberg Tasks, an example of which is the possible EU peacekeeping operation in Macedonia. The development of these arrangements had been envisaged since the early evolution of the European Security and Defence Policy, but the issue became bound up in the broader question of a date for Turkish accession talks and a settlement in Cyprus and its accession to the EU. The EU has now agreed a basis to take the matter forward, on foot of proposals by High Representative Solana. NATO is currently responding to the EU position and we are hopeful that the outstanding issues can be resolved without further delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The Chair of the European Convention, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, made a progress report on the work of the Convention to the European Council. There was an exchange of views with the chairman on foot of his report. I want to underline to this House that the Government is in no doubt about the significance of the convention and fully accepts that its outcome will be highly influential. At the same time, we are also aware that final decisions on treaty change are for the subsequent intergovernmental conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Government is fully aware of the challenges ahead. As I already indicated, we are working in the European Convention, and we will work in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, to ensure that the European Union is reformed and modernised to meet the challenges which flow from the enlargement of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">In the European Convention, Ireland has been among the most active and influential of the small member states. At plenary sessions, we have made contributions on virtually all substantive agenda topics and we will continue to make contributions. In the convention working groups, the Government and the Oireachtas representatives have made very significant contributions and we are grateful to them for the time and effort they have put into this. We are, and will continue to be, involved in very extensive networking at all levels on appropriate occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">In Copenhagen, the European Council decided that the new member states will participate fully in the next intergovernmental conference. This was an important decision and one which Ireland has advocated for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">On the Middle East, we adopted a declaration underlining the importance of the quartet meet ing of the UN, the US, the EU and Russia in Washington on 20 December and the adoption of the joint road map with clear timelines for the establishment of a Palestinian state by 2005. We expressed our alarm at the continuing illegal settlements and urged the Government of Israel to reverse its policy and freeze all settlements immediately. We called on the Israeli and Palestinian people to break the endless cycle of violence and condemned unequivocally all acts of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">On Iraq, we underlined the full and unequivocal support of the EU for Security Council Resolution 1441 and reconfirmed the EU's goal of disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. We noted Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 1441 and that it has submitted its declaration on its programmes of weapons of mass destruction and related products.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The role of the Security Council in maintaining international peace and security must be respected and the EU will continue to give its full support to ensure full and immediate compliance with Resolution 1441. The European Council expressed its sympathy for, and solidarity with, the populations affected by the <i>Prestige</i> oil tanker accident off the north-west coast of Spain. The Commission will examine the need for further economic, social and environmental measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">In the margins of the meeting, I had contacts with Prime Minister Aznar of Spain and raised our concerns in relation to fisheries. I informed the Prime Minister of the difficulties that the Irish fishing industry would face if access to the Irish Box was opened up, especially in the context of declining fish stocks. I indicated that a thorough review of the existing arrangements during next year would allow time for all the issues to be fully aired and for us to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution. I also communicated the importance of the issue to the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, and the President of the European Council, Prime Minister Rasmussen.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is attending the ongoing Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels today. The Minister has the full support of the Government in his efforts to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland's interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Last weekend's European Council marked a further episode in the wonderful adventure of the European Union. It proved, once again, that Europe can meet and deal with the challenges of an ever-changing global environment. It proved, once again, that Europe can craft win-win solutions to the problems it faces. It proved, once again, that Europe can reach compromises which respect the vital national interests of its member states while advancing the political, economic and social interests of all of them. Above all, it showed, once again, that Europe works and that Ireland's place is at the heart of the European Union.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_440">The European Council meeting in Copenhagen last week can truly be described as a historic milestone in the development of the European Union. The decision to allow ten new member states to join the Union in 2004 paves the way for the single largest enlargement in the history of the European project. That decision is recognition of the huge changes which have been implemented in those former Soviet-bloc countries in a period of just over a decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This enlargement will radically change the nature of the European Union and that change will be very much for the better. First, it will increase the number of members by two thirds – from 15 to 25 – and increase the Union's population by 100 million people. Second, it will present new challenges to achieving economic and social cohesion between the relatively prosperous existing member states and the poorer applicant countries – we must remember that not long ago we were one of those poorer applicants. Third, it will necessitate the rebalancing of voting strengths within the institutions provided for in the Treaty of Nice. Above all, this historic enlargement in which we, a tiny Atlantic island, played such a vital role will establish political stability and therefore greater peace and prosperity in central and eastern Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The European project, as we all know, was born out of a determination to prevent further war and devastation of people and their economies in western Europe. By this yardstick alone, it has been a huge success. When the founding fathers of this project signed the Treaty of Rome, little did they know how far and how quickly it would progress. They certainly never imagined that within 50 years the entity they created would facilitate the reunification of Europe and have the potential to become a real global power.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">As a committed European, I am proud of the role that Ireland played in establishing this new age, this new era of European history. We did it before in the Dark Ages when Irish monks set sail to colonise hearts and minds and to civilise the continent of Europe. Many centuries later, we have once again looked east. The people spoke and our speaking gave millions of our fellow Europeans the opportunities for which we ourselves were once so very grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The Nice referendum proved definitively that the people would never again be taken for granted. As Europe evolves, referenda will become part of our political and civic future. Therefore, keeping the public informed and engaged must top the political agenda. Just a few weeks ago, I told the European leaders at a meeting of the European People's Party in Lisbon that Ireland could become a useful example of how Europe can be explained and delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">In that context, I remind the Taoiseach and the Government of the importance of resourcing properly the Committee on European Affairs. I know that the committee will have a number of regional meetings but given that the next intergovernmental conference will produce  another treaty of much more major significance than the Nice treaty, we do not want to be caught again in a situation where the population and the electorate can legitimately say that they were ill-informed or did not know what the treaty was about.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">As the Minister of State dealing with European issues, Deputy Roche, is present, I am sure that in the context of the Irish Presidency in 2004 this will be of critical importance to the way we do our business here, the way we explain Europe and the way we empathise, listen to people and deal with their concerns so that we can win over their trust and confidence. In that context, I would like to think that the work and the moral authority that has been established in part by the convention will be taken in a very serious fashion by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I understand that recently the chairman, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, addressed the French National Assembly on the work of the convention. The Government might consider inviting him, as chairman of the convention, to address Dáil Éireann on the work of the convention and where he sees it going so that he can get a flavour of the opinions, diverse though they may be, in this House. If the chairman is allowed to address the French National Assembly, consideration might be given to extending a similar invitation here in the context of playing our full part in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">On the eve of the European Council meeting, I attended the summit meeting of the European Peoples' Party in Copenhagen. We raised the issue of Turkey's accession to EU membership and made the point strongly that the Commission should be in the position to assess the merits of that application and of the fulfilment of accession criteria before the opening of any formal negotiations. As Turkey was nominated as an official candidate in 1999, the ball is obviously rolling in this direction. The issue of human rights in Turkey has been raised by a number of speakers in the European Parliament. Once that assessment has closed, I hope it will be followed by a detailed analysis of Turkey's fulfilment of accession criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The Danish foreign minister indicated that he received a telephone call from US Secretary of State Colin Powell urging the expeditious incorporation of Turkey into a partnership with the European Union. I understand that President Bush contacted Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen to the same effect on two occasions prior to the European Council meeting. The Taoiseach might indicate whether the US made similar approaches to our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in the lead up to the European Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I urge the Government to take the plunge into Europe seriously. It is difficult to get away from the culture of parish pump politics, but we are now part of a much bigger entity. European policy for the future will affect all of our lives, and it is important that this country be central to those affairs. The European summit in Copenhagen  was historic in the sense that it gave approval for ten new countries to join the EU. I pointed out to the leaders of the European Peoples' Party that Ireland was the only country that gave a people's verdict on Nice. It is as a result of that verdict that these ten countries now have the option of joining the EU. I therefore stress again the importance of involving people and explaining to them what the European project is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">It is necessary that the convention be given a clearer mandate as to the size of the European project we eventually want to achieve. We do not want to see the convention putting forward a series of proposals for an entity the eventual size of which we are still unsure about. There should be more discussion about this aspect of the European agenda. If Turkey is to be nominated as a candidate country, are we then to consider Belarus and other states contiguous to Russia? If the size of the EU is to expand again beyond 25 states, the work of the convention should be tailored to take account of the likely eventual size of the union.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The leaders of the European Peoples' Party passed a recommendation of solidarity with the efforts Spain is making to deal with the worst ecological disaster in its history following the sinking of the <i>Prestige,</i> and I express that solidarity again here. I am glad to note that the Taoiseach raised the issue of the Irish fishing fleet and the review of the Common Fisheries Policy at the European Council meeting. I am not sure that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will make a radical breakthrough in his efforts in talks this weekend. In terms of conservation strategy, it seems perverse that the Irish fishing fleet is prohibited from fishing in Irish waters and the Irish Box because of the depletion of its very small quota, whereas a Spanish fleet can fish in this box and sell fish caught in Irish waters to Irish citizens. I hope Deputy Ahern will fight vigorously on behalf of Irish fishermen. Some 25,000 families are depending on this, and many of them face extinction under the terms of EU proposals being put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I hope the European agenda will receive very high priority from Government in the next session of the Dáil and beyond and that Members on all sides will have the opportunity to debate issues that are of concern not only to us but to our 100 million new-found fellow citizens in Europe.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_454">The outcome of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen is to be welcomed, to the extent that it finally clears the way for the electorate of the candidate states to pass judgment on what has been negotiated on their behalf. I agree with the Taoiseach's description of what took place as "historic". However, the change in balance and focus now in prospect for the union is enormous – if perhaps still not appreciated fully by many people in the current union. In geographic, cultural and economic terms, the enlarged union will have a new centre  of gravity, echoing the old geographical concept of <i>Mitteleuropa.</i> Disparities of income and development will be sharper and the concept of cohesion will need to be redefined. Community policy and the budget will have to be reshaped and there are likely to be new issues as yet unforeseen.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">There is no need to fear these prospects. The history of the EU stretching back to the old EEC is one of coping with enormous challenges in a succession of changing circumstances . There were the challenges of structurally changing the shapes of agriculture and heavy industry – coal and steel – in the original economic community. There were the development and regional issues that arose with the accession of states such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece. There was the project of social Europe and the Single Market and the enormous ambition of establishing a single currency. The union did not flinch from such huge projects, and it succeeded.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Those successes should not blind us to the enormity of this next project. Those successes raise expectations in the candidate states. In addition, the sheer scale of this prospective enlargement, combined with the level of integration established within the existing union, makes for a far more complex agenda. At the same time, the existing union has decided to embark on its own reform, some of that taking account of enlargement but some of it also recognising problems that have emerged – the democratic deficit, remoteness of institutions from the citizens and so on. We under estimate the complexity of this agenda at our peril.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Yet, having followed events in Copenhagen and studied the final communiqué, I have to say there is some cause for genuine concern about some of the drift of development and, more particularly, the lack of knowledge of and debate on the future here. The candidate countries seem to be learning the ropes in terms of special pleading, in-fighting and posturing, a special problem that sometimes serves only to divorce the union from its citizens. When people see and hear the jostling and posturing on news bulletins, they see it all as just politics for cosmetic effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Besieged communities around our coast who rely upon the fishing industry for their livelihoods are an example of this, as they have little belief that the posturing will protect their incomes. I consider myself as much a realist as anyone, but the kind of game-playing, special pleading and horse trading that have too much come to characterise the Council, contribute to the very problem that Mr. dEstaing, is supposed to address instead of passing superior racial and religious judgment on the Turks.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">A few months ago, after the Brussels Council, I remarked on how Europe has changed and how we are today confronted with the question, "What kind of Europe?", or alternatively, "Which Europe?".</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Last weekend, terms of accession were nego tiated for ten new member states which, if accepted by the citizens of those states in referenda over the coming year, will lead to the most enormous change in the shape of the EU. The geographical balance will change, as will the centre of gravity. Income and development disparities will be more acute and the pressures for assistance and transfers are bound to increase. There are likely to be new issues as yet unforeseen. There will, of course, be new opportunities, whether in trade and commerce, social intercourse and cultural exchange, in this vast expansion. There is also the gain of stabilisation and peace. That is the point of it all.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">However, despite the lessons of the Nice debates, I detect a real sense among people in this country at least, and certainly within the Government, of things being unchanged. The failure of the Government to engage properly with the convention and the reported views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, effectively that it will be all right on the night and will be done in the traditional way, is somewhat worrying. To the extent that there are straws in the wind they seem to be little appreciated or understood in Ireland. Again, I single out the Government in this regard. Some might also say of certain proposals that they seem to indicate grand designs by unknown bureaucrats as opposed to any real attempt to grapple with democratic deficits, the impression conveyed by infighting and squabbling, remoteness and removal from real issues. To allow this to continue is to invite a replay of the Nice fiasco.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I note the Council found time to discuss Alpine transit, that is, long distance lorries travelling through Austria. I am sure that for many Austrians, lorries trundling down their roads on the way from somewhere to elsewhere, but not Austria, is a pressing problem. No doubt Austrians look to the promised new Eurovignette directive, whatever that is, with some hope. Would that we could say the same about the Common Fisheries Policy and that the fishing communities of Ireland and elsewhere could look to a sensible and sustainable policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Council flunked the one thing it might have done about Giscard d'Estaing. It might have confronted the implications implicit in his remarks about the Turks. Turkey represented "a different culture" and its admission would be the "end of the EU". This was not a reference to human rights or the record of past Turkish governments. What is this "different culture" that apparently worries Mr. d'Estaing and what is the culture he defends in the context of the current culture of the Council and Commission in relation to, for example, the shambles of the fishing issue? Where is the concern for people, for communities, for a people's Europe in the reality that is now being wrought on coastal communities by the failed fisheries policy? The Council might have censured Giscard d'Estaing. When one recalls what was done to the Austrians after they voted Jorg Haider to power, one must ask whether dual standards apply and whether, unfor tunately, the EU can be portrayed by sceptics as an alliance of convenience for a number of bigger member states that always escape censure.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">How the citizens of the candidate states vote in their forthcoming referenda is now a matter for them. What is a matter of some consequence for all of us is the kind of EU they will join and the kind of EU that has evolved. The next two years will decide that. Some of the design for the Union is becoming apparent. We are familiar with a certain amount of it, more Commissioners – eventually not one for everyone but always at least one for the big member states, more MEPs and changes in the composition of Parliament, more talk of openness, transparency, the role of Parliament and the Presidency as well as the status of the president of the Commission and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">There is much more to the design for the future of Europe than these features. At the beginning of December, for example, the Commission published two documents on the future. It adopted a communication on the future architecture of the Union, "For the European Union – Peace, Freedom, Solidarity". The second document is a rather strange work of 178 pages titled "Contribution to a preliminary draft Constitution of the European Union". It is said of it that it "is a working document prepared by a group of experts at the request of the President and Commissioners Barnier and Vitorino". It is described as a "working draft which does not in any way commit the Commission". It is an enormously radical document drawn up by six people. It fleshes out the draft constitution of the EU prepared earlier by the convention chaired by Giscard d'Estaing. That document is really no more than a bare bones, a series of chapter headings and sub-headings.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The Commission's working draft is something else. We do not have the time today to deal with the content of its working paper other than to note that there are aspects of it that will strike those who read it as extremely controversial, for example, in relation to the harmonisation of criminal and civil law, subject to that magic formulation "if necessary". Who will determine necessity? There is mention in the document of the possibility of "community taxes" with another magic proviso, "although these are mentioned only in principle". What in this context is the "tax package" that was the subject of the recent ECOFIN meeting held in Brussels? According to the outgoing Danish Presidency, this will be the subject of a final ECOFIN meeting on 21 January next. What is in the package? I note that it deals apparently with taxation of savings and a "code of conduct on business taxation". What is in the package and what is on the agenda for the January meeting?</p>
          <p eId="para_467">While on the subject of ECOFIN, I might also mention the mooted changes in the growth and stability pact. Whatever the merits of the original pact, there is now a recognised need for change and change is coming. Again, however, the Mini ster for Finance, for his own reasons, seems intent on ignoring the welcome and sensible loosening up of the rules of the pact. There are extremely radical proposals in the Commission's draft on ratification and entry into force of the constitution which take account of the possibility that some member states may not manage to ratify the proposed treaty. They might vote "no" in a referendum. As I read it, it would be deemed that a "no" vote would amount to self expulsion from the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I make no judgment at this point on these and other proposals and views on the future, such as, for example, those of the President of Portugal on EU common defence and security and relations with NATO when he spoke at the beginning of the month in Athens. Where is the communication of this to the public? Where are the media? Where is the Government communications programme? My point is no more than it was last October when I spoke on the Brussels Council outcome. The negotiations are proceeding apace. Ideas and proposals are being put forward and yet, as others in this House have also commented, neither the Oireachtas nor the Irish people has got to grips with what is happening. The French have a saying, <i>Les chiens aboient, la caravane passé</i>– the dogs bark but the caravan moves on. In whose interest is that? Who is driving the caravan? It is far from clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">In the late 1960s the scientist Garrett Hardin penned an essay, "The Tragedy of the Commons", dealing with population growth. However, it was soon recognised to have much wider implications, particularly in relation to the environment, whether in terms of exploitation of a resource such as common grazing land or the ocean, or in terms of uncontrolled or common use of land or the ocean for the deposit of waste. Without ownership or rules that equate in their effect to ownership such activities must eventually lead to ruin – over-grazing, over-fishing and pollution:</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Hardin contended that the natural response in our culture to such developments was to look for technical solutions, expect scientists to solve our problem. He defined a technical solution as "one that requires a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality". His point was that technical solutions do not work in respect of this class of problem. The commons only works under very particular conditions, those of low or extensive exploitation. Once intensive exploitation becomes the norm the result must be eventual disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The Common Fisheries Policy, in effect, constituted the marine resources of the member states of the Community as a Community resource  administered and managed by Community institutions on behalf of all citizens. At the margins, national authorities continue to have some role, for example through 12 mile limits and, in our own case, the so-called Irish Box. At the centre, the Community established a set of arrangements that retained the framework of the commons. It encouraged intensive development, institutionalised national rivalries, created a technical-scientific priesthood, and installed the Commission as some kind of referee overseeing a game of chaos.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The result is an annual bun fight, the yearly pre-Christmas scrap over the next year's dwindling available catch. The scientists are wheeled in. The Commissioner blusters and threatens. Ministers jump up and down and on the streets fishermen picket and protest. There are variations from one year to another, usually concerning one or more species. This year it is cod and hake and it is Irish coastal and fishing communities that are most particularly singled out to pay the price for Community failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">The chaos of the formula and the bankruptcy of the policy is best illustrated by this year's supposed compromise – fleet and catch reductions, in general, and intensification of plundering in the Irish box with, again, Irish fishing communities taking the brunt of adjustment. In due course we can expect another crisis. Shortly, the scientific priests will again be wheeled out, this time to tell us of the disaster in prospect in the Irish Box. The answer at that point will presumably be another round of so-called cuts, factory fishing up to the shore line and the EU equivalent of the Newfoundland crisis. The Common Fisheries Policy is a failure. It has not worked. Irish fishing communities are being told by the Government that they must make sacrifices, that this is a bargaining exercise and that the Minister and the Government will do their utmost to minimise the pain. That is not what is happening, it is predation and the destruction of a natural resource. The emperor has no clothes.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I wish to reiterate my party's objections to Turkey being given an accession date at this time. It  is not because it is a Muslim nation, which some people appear to find unacceptable, but because it has not yet adequately addressed its domestic human rights issues. This has been confirmed by the European Commission's progress report. It is not just a matter of a few minor abuses or aberrations. Turkey has been a major human rights violator for many years. It has waged a brutal campaign of suppression and torture on its Kurdish population and against many of its prisoners over several decades. If Turkey wishes to join the European Union let it make the necessary reforms. It also needs to build up a track record of respect for human rights, one that indicates lasting and durable change, before it can be admitted.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Another reason it should not be admitted to the EU is it has used the Cypriot conflict as a political football and has held the peace process in that country hostage to demands for an early accession date. Such behaviour should not be rewarded. I welcome the Taoiseach's remark that our preference is for the accession of a united Cyprus.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I wish to highlight some worrying developments at Copenhagen that not only aggravate Sinn Féin's concerns at the direction of the future of Europe but also confirm some of the suspicions and fears raised by us and others during both campaigns on the Nice treaty. I refer to the EU-NATO pact that was finalised at Copenhagen which, for the first time, directly mentions military operation and the consequent expectation of early Rapid Reaction Force deployment in the new year. This is just one in a series of disturbing developments in the militarisation of the EU that needs to be fully debated in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I am also concerned by the Franco-German proposals made at the European convention on the protocol for military harmonisation, a common military procurement policy and the subjection of security and defence matters to qualified majority voting and enhanced co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I am further concerned by the EU defence zone proposals which were tabled by the working group on defence earlier this month as they do not contain any provision for institutional control of defence expenditure. Another worrying development is the call for higher defence spending fixed at a proportion of GDP. These proposals are indicative of the direction the EU could take if we fail to say "no".</p>
          <p eId="para_483">All of these critical debates are happening now, but not in this House. We need to have a proper debate on the future of Europe in regard to military matters and the policy of neutrality. We are due to go into recess, yet we have not had a Dáil debate on the impending war in Iraq and the Government's conduct in regard to these developments. That is outrageous and irresponsible. We are operating under the shadow of a dangerous ambiguity in this regard as both the Government and the EU have failed to unequivocally oppose war on Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The Sinn Féin Party is disappointed that the  Taoiseach failed to make the threat to the fishing industry a crisis issue at Council level, especially considering the Government's past failure. It had one more opportunity which it failed to take. We must ensure that there is no further erosion of the present position in regard to Irish fishermen and the Irish fishing industry. We should get guaranteed conditions for them.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_485">I welcome many of the outcomes of the Copenhagen Summit, in particular, that significant progress has been made on enlargement and that negotiations with Turkey will begin. It is important that it meets the Copenhagen criteria referred to by the previous speaker.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Taoiseach said that this summit has proved that Europe can meet certain challenges. One challenge it failed to meet is that of the democratic deficit. It was significant that, once again, we witnessed pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of Copenhagen. This has become a feature of so many summits. One of the stated aims of the Laeken declaration was to try to bring Europe closer to the people. That has not happened although it was the purpose of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The question we have to ask ourselves is whether the convention has succeeded in introducing more democracy to the European Union and whether it has brought Europe closer to the people. I believe it has not and what we are seeing in the convention is Europe accelerating at quite a rate, but not changing direction. We are seeing strong movement in a certain direction and, in effect, we are being propelled along a "Giscardian" path. We must ask ourselves how the business of the convention is being conducted. We know that Giscard d'Estaing is at the top. We then have the presidium and the various people in the presidium chair the working groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">A fundamental question is how we move towards decision making within the convention. We do not take votes so it is then a question of consensus but how do we define "consensus" within the convention? I have heard various definitions of "consensus" within the convention. I have been told it is anything above a majority or anything that stops a walk-out but what I know from sitting on the working groups is that the dissent, or other voices, are not being recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I sit on the working group on defence and I can tell the Minister that at the final meeting, to put it in its simplest terms, the doves outnumbered the hawks quite substantially but that is not reflected in the report. The English version of the report is ready today; the Minister may have had an opportunity to read it. I have concerns about the proposals in this report. It is clear, and Copenhagen showed again, the very close relationship between the EU and NATO. We now have access to NATO assets and the question I tried to put to the Minister today was about where we are going. The conflict between autonomous EU defence and NATO has not been fully  resolved. There has always been this fudge because we have a situation where the British want us to remain in close proximity to the Americans. The Franco-German Axis wants us to move away from that and as I have said here before, that has significant cost implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">From our point of view it is clear we have moved away from our traditional neutrality. It is clear when we sit on the working groups because the preferred phrase now is "non-alignment". I have had to work very hard to introduce the phrase "neutrality" in the discussions. It is probably seen now as a redundant phrase but it is clear that we have made what they consider to be significant progress and what we have seen is a clear advance in the working group of the military industrial complex within Europe. What is the Irish position on the question of enhanced co-operation in the area of defence? That is an important question which I would like the Minister to answer. It is clear we will have a referendum on this issue but most people do not even know there is a convention on the future of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I welcome the remarks by Deputy Rabbitte. It is encouraging to hear him talk about the tragedy of the comments but the one thing that is missing from the convention is a discussion on sustainability. It has not happened and I regret that.</p>

          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_492">As somebody who voted "Yes" in the Nice referendum and who canvassed for a "Yes" vote, I warmly welcome the decision taken by the European Council at Copenhagen to admit ten new members to the EU. This is a landmark in the evolution of the European Union and the consequences of that decision will profoundly affect the lives of all Europeans for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">When I speak about the future of the EU, however, I must admit I was a "Yes" voter with some concerns as to the direction of future EU policy and while many have spoken in this House and elsewhere about needing to allay the fears of those who voted "No", they under estimate the genuine concerns of many "Yes" voters. One of my concerns, which I know is shared by many others, is that we are already well advanced on the next stage of European integration, that is, agreement on some form of constitution which will determine the shape of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">In recent weeks there have been a number of meetings of the European movement throughout the country to discuss the future of Europe and consistently at these meetings there has been a strong aversion to the use of the word "constitution". This aversion will be shared by many Irish citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">In a world where change pervades almost every aspect of our lives and where the sands appear to constantly shift, many citizens see our Constitution as something to hold on to and while the courts may interpret the Constitution in a certain way, ordinary citizens see it as a constant. There is a sense that it gives us some real measure of  control over our own destiny, that we are not subject to others, that we do not lose national power and that national sovereignty remains in the hands of Irish citizens yet the Convention on Europe is leading us in the direction of a European constitution. Where do we stand?</p>
          <p eId="para_496">We are moving too fast. I understand it is one of the functions of politicians to lead, inspire, articulate a vision and open up possibilities for the future but equally we must listen and engage our citizens. We cannot set out at speed on a given road and expect our citizens to catch up, and I am concerned that this is happening to some extent. One of the unfortunate consequences of this is that we may jeopardise the very future we all wish to create by moving too fast. In trying to achieve an interconnectedness between Ireland and the EU, we may disconnect from the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Our Government needs to play a much stronger role in determining outcomes from the Convention on Europe and to be seen to do so. We need to articulate a vision for the future of Europe and outline the role Ireland can play in helping to achieve that vision. The Convention on Europe has been in place for almost nine months, with six or seven months remaining, and as yet we await a clear statement on the future of the EU from our Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">When Romano Prodi addressed the European Parliament in Brussels on 5 December he stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The debate aroused by the convention in recent months has widened our horizons. The national Parliaments and Governments have taken it seriously from the start and sent top-rate personalities to represent them. The goal of the Convention has grown in ambition. It is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement. It must work out the overall shape of the Union for generations to come. And, above all, I am happy this is taking place in the light of day. The next few months will see the advent of a new united Europe, and we can be proud it will have come into being democratically and transparently.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">That is a fairly long quote but it clearly indicates the role of the convention as perceived by our European neighbours, yet we have no clear proposals to that convention. The distinct impression from the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is that the convention does not matter all that much and that all decisions of consequence will be taken by the subsequent intergovernmental conference. While in theory this argument may stand up, the reality might not be so. It may be extremely difficult if not impossible to unravel agreed proposals from the convention, and we may find we have much less room to manoeuvre than we expected. We can no longer sit back and let events overtake us. Otherwise, Irish citizens will see a growing distance between themselves and those who are  shaping our future because, first, we do not see a transparent, constructive and pro-active input into the decision making process and, second, we see this process as a runaway train not stopping at any station to pick up its passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Convention on Europe is failing to reach out to ordinary Irish citizens and for that a price will have to be paid. That price might be the undoing of the European project. The earlier Nice referendum outcome was a warning to all of us. It should not go unheeded.</p>

That was not agreed at the council and there was some disappointment among the Turkish public and in Turkish political circles about that. The decision of the council is set out in the conclusions and confirms the need for Turkey to meet the Copenhagen criteria before negotiations can begin. The Turkish prime minister attended the short meeting of the 27 states and confirmed that while Turkey was dissatisfied with the dates it had been given, its commitment to engagement with the EU remains  undeterred and will be intensified. He said he recognised the political realities involved in the requirement for membership negotiations to begin.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_509">Arising from decisions taken in Lisbon, the matters on the agenda are now very tightly arranged and it has led to an improvement in the workings of the European Council. The only issues to be discussed were enlargement, a paper from the presidency on how future presidencies might function on foot of the enlargement and some conclusions on maritime safety. It is not possible for heads of state to call for a discussion on other matters and I welcome that. There is now a greater strategic focus and this reflects well on the reputation of the council, the decisions it makes and the quality of the discussions that take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The comments on the Middle East the Deputy referred to were not raised in any meetings I attended. A good statement on the Middle East was drawn up. We insisted that the need for a Palestinian ceasefire to bring a stop to the expansion of Israeli settlements – which is the position of the Israeli government – is a non-starter. Expansion must stop in any event because it is illegal. The Irish contribution insisted that the settlements issue be highlighted as an illegal activity and should not be tied to the issue of a ceasefire.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">A very good discussion took place between foreign ministers on neighbourhood policy. We tried to outline how the EU will be shaped in the future. The question of the Maghreb group, the Balkans, Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus and even Russia joining the union is now coming to the top of the agenda. There is a need for people to know where we expect the borders of the EU to finally arrive at. Some of the arguments would suggest that it would end up on the far side of Singapore. A Commission paper on a neighbourhood policy  is due in March. It is to be drafted by Mr. Chris Patten's department.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">This takes up the question of the boundary of European culture. One could argue that it is not restricted to what are regarded as the physical geographical boundaries of Europe. As the EU expands, the question of sharing values without sharing membership of the institutions will arise in terms of how the Union will proceed. We need an efficient and effective Union. We know that an increasing number of member states brings great pressure to bear on the decision-making processes that are both representative and effective at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">These issues will find articulation in neighbourhood policy and in the context of the espousal and propagation of values in the interests of extending the zone of peace, security and stability not only within Europe but further afield. This issue is arising and there was an interesting preliminary discussion on it. Further working groups have been set up under the convention in relation to a social Europe which, it is hoped, will start to address some of the issues the Deputy mentioned, the scope of which extends beyond mere economic issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">What nuances did the Minister glean in regard to renationalisation, a much discussed subject in recent years, from the summit? Some countries tend to wish to retain more power in their national parliaments and to exert such power. To what extent was that visible during the course of the summit and how has that been measured in the course of the convention? To what extent does the Minister consider this will affect Ireland's position and that of countries of a similar size within the European Union, having regard to the fact that by retaining a greater share of power in a national parliament, the bigger the country, the more powerful the country and, consequently, the greater the amount of power that will reside with such a national parliament?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_515">It is vital for the preservation of common policy that the idea of renationalisation does not resurface as a means of a co-funding mechanism for common policies on agriculture, fisheries or any other area because it is important that the financing mechanism for common policies remains with the European institutions. The final compromise provides for a top-up arrangement from national resources for accession countries in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy beyond 2006, as a means of trying to bridge the gap between that which they would like to have and that which was available from the Danish Presidency as the final negotiating position.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">When the Prime Minister of Denmark, in his position as President of the Council, visited us here to discuss the upcoming Council, the Taoiseach and I made it clear that it was very important in the conclusions that there should be a reference to the fact if this top-up arrangement was to be a part of the final package in order to  get agreement, it would be generous in terms of getting an accession agreement for the ten applicant countries but would not be regarded in the future as setting a precedent for any renationalisation argument to be used again, particularly regarding the Common Agricultural Policy reform in the future. That explicit reference and those specific words were taken up by the Danish Presidency as a result of our discussions with the Danish Prime Minister. We were happy to see that reflected in the conclusions because it is an important point in strategic terms for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The question of the role of national parliaments being increased is based on trying to give some flesh and meaning to the subsidiarity argument. I am more than happy to go before committees to explain precisely the contributions we have been making to the convention. They have been far more fulsome and involved than perhaps people have been given to believe from listening to the media. The reply I gave to a specific question seems to have permeated a perception about our position in relation to the convention. When asked a question as to whether the convention would want to make a proposition in relation to tax harmonisation, I said in direct reply, "Yes, I would not be surprised what they would propose in that respect."  That should not be taken as our demeanour in relation to the process. It would be an inaccurate and unfair reflection on the Government position if that particular, perhaps rather flippant, remark in response to the ongoing question I have been asked regarding tax harmonisation should be regarded by anyone in the body politic as setting out our position. We have made significant contributions in relation to the question of the charter, the simplification agenda, subsidiarity and the future work of the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Deputy Harkin suggested that we have not set out a position. This is an evolving debate in which we are involved. As the Deputy said, the Commission only produced its considered position on 5 December. It is important for a member state such as Ireland, which is very supportive of a strong Commission, to obtain, in the first instance, the Commission's position on these matters before we start to stake out a negotiating position.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Being engaged in the convention process, we will take an overview of the position, as we prepare for the Intergovernmental Conference. Parliamentary representatives present who are on working groups will know there is a number of working groups engaged in this. We have to make sure that we make our positions clear, make an input and try to be part of the consensus if we can, but as in the case of the Nice treaty there were certain areas in respect of which we could not be involved in a consensus and we successfully negotiated our position from that point.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_521">I will deal with the Deputy's second point first. I am satisfied with the current arrangements whereby the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, has been given the job of Government representative. I know what the French and Germans have done. They are in a minority on that in terms of all the member states. This is a matter for each Government to decide. With those representatives' busy portfolios, I am not sure if they are able to attend the working groups. Perhaps they might attend a plenary session now and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">We should consider the substance of the work being done by our Government. I do not want to reflect or comment on the quality of work those representatives are doing for their Governments – it is a matter for them. I am satisfied with the work the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is doing. Other colleagues, parliamentary and otherwise, are also putting in a good effort and are making sure that we are in attendance, prepared, pro-active and working and networking behind the scenes with different states on different issues. The idea that this Parliament is not engaged is not a reflection of reality, as is recognised by Members who are on those groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">With regard to the basic point on ESDP, it is an important decision for EU capability. The development of permanent arrangements between the EU and NATO has been envisaged since the early evolution of ESDP, as has been outlined in the conclusions of successive European Councils. A role for NATO in relation to ESDP arises from the need for the European Union, which is not a military organisation, to have access to certain capabilities and resources such as transportation, headquarters and planning facilities, which will be required for substantial crisis management missions. Discussions had effectively stalled on the issue of participation of non-EU European members of NATO in ESDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">At the European Council held in Brussels in October and on the basis of conclusions drawn at the previous Nice European Council, EU heads of State and Government agreed on modalities in this regard. At Copenhagen further negotiations took place in the context of general discussions on enlargement, particularly with regard to Turkey. EU heads of State and Government concluded that agreement could be finalised and that necessary follow up, including on arrangements for secure exchange of relevant information between the two organisations, can now proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I want to be clear that our participation in  ESDP is not automatic. We have the triplelock arrangements, we have retained sovereignty in this area and we successfully negotiated in the Treaty of Nice the requirement for unanimity in relation to ESDP. The Deputy raised a fair question about the working group on defence. This development has only emerged in recent days and we have to examine and study it. Certain clarifications will be sought by us and we will have to make sure that, from our perspective, we will retain our position going forward. We set out our position on ESDP in the Seville Declaration and we are not going beyond that.</p>

          <from>Mr Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_539">Before June 1997, when Fianna  Fáil and the Progressive Democrats formed a Government, the average price of a new house was just under €100,000. Three weeks ago the Permanent TSB survey of house prices showed that the average price had broken through the €200,000 barrier for the first time. That is an increase of more than 100%, four times the rate of inflation, three times the rate of increase in average earnings and more than twice the increase in the cost of building index.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Those are the figures for the country as a whole. In the larger urban centres, the increase in house prices has been even more dramatic. In Dublin the average price of a new house has increased from €124,000 to more than €300,000 in the five and a half years of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">That is not all. As average prices have increased, the average size of a new house has diminished. An article by Donal Buckley in the current edition of <i>Housing Times,</i> which is published by HomeBond, adds a new dimension to the house price issue: “One of the ways in which builders have curtailed the growth in new house prices has been by reducing the floor space in new homes on the Dublin market”. Referring to both Dublin and the rest of the country, he says, “In both markets, apartments, which are generally smaller in size, are increasing their share of the market”. Later in the same article, he tells us:</p>
          <p eId="para_542">In 1998, houses in the 90 – 125 sq. m. category accounted for 71% of all Dublin houses being built and 61% of country houses. However, in the last few years in Dublin this category has been pared back to 51% of a larger market.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">In other words, after five and a half years of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats the house buyer is paying more than twice the price for a much smaller dwelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Inevitably, thousands of families on good modest incomes have been priced out of the housing market. This is acknowledged by those who work in the market. The Property Review 2002-2003 recently published by Lisney states, "Many first time buyers have been priced out of the Dublin market altogether and counties like Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth have seen a dramatic increase in starter home sales".</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, seems to have difficulty in grasping this message. On Question Time on 28 November last, he offered us the following ministerial perspective on house prices: "I believe that people on good incomes will have no difficulty buying homes for themselves". He declined to define "a good income" but went on to explain, "I am simply saying that somehow or other, these people – I have heard Deputy Gilmore's comment previously about the garda and the nurse and so on – seem to manage".</p>
          <p eId="para_546">In case we think the Minister was caught momentarily off balance in a robust Dáil  exchange, these comments repeat almost verbatim his interview in the current issue of <i>Cornerstone,</i> the magazine of the Homeless Agency. The article states:</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Noel Ahern questioned some of the stories about affordability. "I hear an awful lot about the nurse and the doctor and the nurse and the guard who can't afford to buy a house. Yet I see them out there and they seem to be doing it. Expectations have gone through the roof".</p>
          <p eId="para_548">So now we have it. The aspirations of the young working couple to buy their own home is considered by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to be an expectation too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Minister of State does not have to rely on stories he is hearing or on what I say to conclude that home ownership has now been put beyond the reach of a huge chunk of young people by the Government in which he serves. There is now an official measure of housing affordability. It is defined in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Using that measure, each local authority last year drew up a housing strategy in which it estimated the number of newly forming households that can not afford to buy their own home over the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The Minister of State has to date not published the aggregate results of the housing strategies. However, four agencies, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold, have together independently analysed the housing strategies and, in the report which they published last month entitled, Housing – Access for All, they concluded that: "It is projected that 33% of new households will not be able to afford to become home owners, based on the calculations prescribed under Part V; that figure rises to 42% in urban areas". We know that in Dublin it is almost 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The greatest change in society brought about by the Fianna Fáil-PD Government concerns home ownership. In its five and a half year reign and, amazingly, during the period of our country's greatest economic success, it has changed housing tenure from the normality of home ownership to one where anything between one third and half of new households are priced out of owning their own home. This is the Government which has put home ownership beyond the reach of working people. The enormous implications of this for public housing policy and society have not yet been fully grasped by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The immediate consequence has been a dramatic increase in private renting. In 1997 there were approximately 135,000 private rented tenancies. Today there are about 200,000. Like house prices, rents have also shot up. There are no official figures for rent levels, but most commentators agree that a family sized unit which would have been rented for €500 to €600 per month in 1997 would now cost between €1,200 and €1,500 per month.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Minister, Deputy Cullen, seems to favour  the shift from home ownership to renting, and in a recent radio debate with me he drew attention to the norm on the continental mainland where people rent rather than buy their homes. He omitted to state that in other European countries tenants enjoy legal rights and security of tenure which do not apply here. In Ireland there are no controls on rent increases and no security of tenure for the vast majority of tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">In 1999, the then Minister of State, Bobby Molloy, established the Commission on the Private Rented Sector. It reported in July 2000 and recommended a number of modest reforms, some of which were tax-friendly for landlords and some of which required legislation to protect the rights of tenants. The Government has already implemented the recommendations which benefit landlords, but two and a half years after the publication of the report, it has still not published the Bill to give tenants some minimum legal rights. Meanwhile, thousands of tenants have been evicted over the past five years and many are still subjected to arbitrary and unfair treatment and to poor housing conditions. Threshold states that in the first nine months of this year alone, it dealt with 2,720 queries about conditions in private rented dwellings, including 83 queries concerning infestation of rats and 242 queries concerning non-compliance with legal minimum physical standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Evictions from private rented accommodation have contributed to the growth in homelessness, which Focus Ireland now estimates to be about 6,000. Mary Higgins, director of the Homeless Agency, writing in <i>Cornerstone</i> this month, points out the number of families and couples who are homeless in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area has increased from 1,290 in 1999 to 1,470 this year, an increase of 14%. These households account for a staggering 1,200 children who will be homeless this Christmas and staying in temporary and emergency accommodation in bed and breakfasts and shelters around the city. These are the forgotten children of a newly affluent society, which is now ruled by an uncaring Government. The growth in homelessness and the length of time which families have to spend in bed and breakfasts and temporary accommodation is directly related to the Government's failure to deliver on its social housing commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">In June 1997, when the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government was elected, there were 26,000 applicants seeking local authority housing. The assessment of housing needs, published in March 2002, shows this number has now increased to more than 48,000. Indeed, if those who are seeking shared ownership, larger accommodation and traveller accommodation are added, the real estimate of housing need is closer to 60,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">In the PPF agreement, about which we hear much these days, the Government undertook to deliver an additional 25,000 local authority houses between 2002 and 2003. At best, only  15,000 of those houses will have been delivered by the end of the programme. Some 2,204 were built in 2000 and 3,622 in 2001. It is estimated 5,000 will be built in 2002 and 4,000 in 2003. The performance is even worse when compared with the targets set in the NDP. This anticipated the production of approximately 350,000 housing units between 2000 and 2006, a target which will probably be achieved, but of which just 50,000 were to be social housing units. However, more than half way into the seven-year life of the NDP, only 15,000 of the 50,000 social houses promised will have been delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The human consequences of this failure by Government visit all of us at our constituency clinics every week where we meet young families on low incomes living in overcrowded, stressful and unhealthy conditions, either with an extended family or in unsuitable and over-priced private rented accommodation. Every week, these people are suffering for the failure of Government housing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Given the overall scale of the housing crisis, one would have expected a newly re-elected Government, which cared at all about the needs of the people, to come back with some fresh thinking or some new policies to tackle this seemingly intractable problem. Instead, the re-elected Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has made it worse. In July it instructed local authorities to discontinue turnkey developments. These were arrangements which were being made by some councils with private developers for the purchase of schemes of houses for social housing purposes. It was estimated that approximately 1,000 of this years 5,000 output would be met by turnkey houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">At the same time the Government introduced a new requirement for the approval of tenders, after they had been accepted by local authorities, the effect of which is to discourage builders from tendering for local authority housing contracts. These, of course, in the language of the Taoiseach were not cuts at all, but merely adjustments. However, in the Book of Estimates which was published in November there could be no disguising the cut. The Exchequer provision for social housing will be 5% less in 2003 than in 2002, and when construction inflation is taken into account, the real cut is about 15%. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, have attempted to argue this is not a cut at all, that councils can use their own resources, tenders will be lower, or something will somehow turn up. However, the give-away is contained in reply to a parliamentary question on 28 November in which the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, stated "I expect that local authorities will complete or acquire some 5,500 houses in 2002 and approximately 4,000 in 2003". If the projected number of houses for next year is 1,500 less than this year, then what is that if it is not a cut? These cuts were followed by the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant, which will immediately make it €3,810 more expensive to buy and  will tilt the balance in the market even more in favour of investors who were already given a leg up in the December 2001 budget which changed their stamp duty and interest reliefs.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The Government's attempt in the budget to soften the blow by increasing mortgage interest relief, worth about €350, was cynical because the increase in VAT on new homes has taken away six times more from the first-time buyers than they will get back in interest relief. The combined effect of the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and the increased VAT is to add almost €6,000 to the price of a new house. Up to now, the Government could plead a defence of helplessness, or even unwillingness to intervene in the housing market to calm house prices, but that is no longer true. This is the first time that Government action has directly increased the price of houses for first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The Dáil has the power to annul the regulation abolishing the first-time buyer's grant. On behalf of the Labour Party and on behalf of all the first-time buyers who will be affected by the abolition of the grant, I am calling on every Deputy in this House, including those on the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats benches who have criticised the abolition of the grant, to vote for its retention when the vote on this motion is taken tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I also call on members of the House to vote to annul the new regulations on rent allowances. The new regulations represent the most savage and cynical cut inflicted on poor people by this Government. The regulations increase the minimum personal contribution for rent by €4.38, from €7.62 to €12, which immediately reduces the nominal budget social welfare increase of €6 to a net €1.62 for people on supplementary welfare and on basic social welfare payments. It caps the maximum rent allowance which may be paid by a health board, thus exposing poor tenants to the full financial force of the new rent increases. It actually prevents rent allowance being paid at all to a tenant where the rent exceeds the maximum allowance payable, a point to which I drew the attention of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill. These regulations will result in increased evictions and homelessness, and will deepen poverty for those who are already poor. They should be rejected by the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Over the past five years, as the housing crisis has worsened, the Labour Party has proposed a range of possible solutions including the assembling of public land banks and the windfall taxing of rezoning profits to curb speculation and profiteering in building land; the establishment of a national housing authority to drive the provision of affordable housing; the introduction of legislation to give tenants basic rights; the introduction of consumer protection legislation; the appointment of a housing market regulator to protect those buying their homes; the widening of social housing provision; the introduction of a  new housing benefit; and the implementation of the integrated strategy on homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">This re-elected Fianna Fáil – Progressive Democrats Government seems even less willing to take Labour's proposals on board. Does it now have a housing policy at all? Let us hear again from the Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern. Pressed during Question Time in the Dáil on 28 November, he offered the following solution to the housing crisis:</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I accept that there are pressures and, because of these, the Department and successive Governments have tried to help people who are caught in the limbo to which I refer by introducing measures such as the affordable housing scheme. On that day, the way of the future was to be the affordable housing scheme. Five days later, in a most disgraceful surrender to the construction lobby, the Government effectively abolished the affordable housing scheme. It is now rushing legislation through the House, which will give back 16,000 social housing sites to private builders. So much for the Minister's solution to the housing crisis. If this Government has a policy on housing, it is one which favours the investor over the first-time buyer, the landlord over the tenant and the land speculator over the family in need of housing.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_567">When the legislation, which it is intended to revoke tomorrow, was first introduced by the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, Cork City Council and Cork County Council, of which the Acting Chairman is a member, organised a seminar in a city hotel. It was extremely well attended and included participants from all the agencies concerned, including both councils. The Construction Industry Federation was also strongly represented. To facilitate participation by all, those attending were placed at tables of ten, at which a member of each of the various organisations was seated.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The conference started with a filibuster by the CIF. Its members stood up at each table in turn and asked the same question, namely, whether the builders, instead of building the social and affordable houses, would not be allowed to give the local authorities the land or an equivalent sum of money. The man all the newspapers have quoted welcoming this legislation led the charge that day.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">It was obvious what was happening and what the CIF's problem was. Its members wanted to take on the burden of selling houses if it was possible the next door neighbour could have been on a local authority housing list. However, when it was pointed out to them that if the land was surrendered to local authorities, as the CIF was suggesting, the local authorities would be entitled to build a halting site on it, they very quickly backed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">This was just their first stab at the provision.  The second came about in a much more devious way. Although I and others who favour the legislation were not approached, I am certain the CIF lobbied councillors in the same way it lobbied Deputies to ensure the proposal before us was introduced. At council level, the 20% we were told we could divide up between social housing and affordable housing as we liked was suddenly allocated and became 15% affordable housing and 5% social housing. We fought this decision in vain. Therefore, we were left with provision for just 5% social housing, as opposed to 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">As Deputy Allen will recall, we got our affordable housing scheme of some 40 houses, for which we received 600 applications from young couples who could not raise the money that is now needed to put a roof over one's head. According to all the Ministers concerned, this group of 600 couples will not miss the €3,800 and can well afford to house themselves. The effect of the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant for the 40 people whose names were selected by lottery is that the €3,800, which was meant to be used as part of the deposit for the houses, will no longer be available and they will have to be reassessed to ascertain if they can find the money the Government took from them.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">It is a disgraceful move, which has ensured that what has always been considered a necessity, a roof over one's head, has become a luxury which few can afford. When I asked one young woman who was seeking a shared ownership mortgage what it would mean to lose the €3,800, she replied she would have to work for a further two years to save this sum. From time to time people lose touch with the realities of life for those who work for An Post or in factories or for the Government in civil service jobs at the lower end of the scale. This is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Every day, social commentators tell us that young people do not know what to do with their money and are constantly spending. They spend because there is nothing to save for. Their money is worthless. They cannot do as the Minister and I did, namely, save for a home which would allow them to enter a relationship, start a family and live a life independent of their families because the Government has ensured that having a home is a luxury only the wealthy can afford. Its actions in this respect have been disgraceful.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_576">As housing is the number one issue in my constituency, I will address some issues of particular importance to my constituents. Many of my constituents live in flats and are waiting for corporation houses. Some have been on a transfer list for 12 years which is hard to believe, but true. They are demoralised and feel they have been completely ignored by the system. They cannot get a transfer to other local authority accommo dation and will never be able to own their homes. Why are flat tenants the only local authority tenants who cannot buy their homes?</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Home ownership is a key way of allowing estates to become stable. Allowing tenants to buy has stabilised corporation built suburbs on the north and south sides of Dublin city. Permitting flat tenants to do the same would help community development in these complexes. A flat tenant purchase scheme would give existing tenants a sense of ownership, as well as help them on to the first step of the property ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Private apartments are run by management companies or groups of residents and there is no reason similar arrangements could not be introduced for corporation complexes. Social housing provided by co-operatives should also be available to buy for tenants, as happens now with local authority houses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_273" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_579">I introduced that in the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I welcome that. Dublin South-Central has a large number of corporation flat complexes which were neglected for many years and abandoned to drugs. Refurbishment work has been done on some blocks of flats, while others have been demolished. However, tenants need to know that there is no risk the builders will down tools and abandon them once again. I hope the residents of these areas, such as the St. Michael's Estate in Fatima Mansions, can look forward with confidence to quality refurbishment programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Besides the residents of such estates, I meet people every week in different circumstances, who need secure and comfortable accommodation. I meet men in their 40s and 50s who have left the family home because there is no place for them, people with long-term mental health problems and their suffering families for whom there is no place, and young people living in overpriced and poor quality rented accommodation who have very little chance of getting on to the housing ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The capping of the rent allowance, the removal of the first-time buyer's grant and the increase in VAT has militated further against these first – time buyers. These retrograde steps have caused untold hardship to many young people, in particular. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, must be living on a different planet if they are not aware of this trauma. Housing is in a mess not because of lack of capacity but because the interests of the developer and the speculator are placed before those of the disadvantaged and the modest income earner.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The Minister should ask the clerical officers in his office and Department how they make ends meet. These conversations might form the basis of some of his housing policy. Many commute for hours every week, others live in expensive rented accommodation, often of poor quality, while many others live at home.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_584">I welcome the opportunity to again say a few words about housing. When I last spoke about housing in the House, I said the housing crisis had torn the heart out of the economy. I do not see how anyone could contradict that. Deputy Gilmore mentioned the rise in prices. The price of a house has doubled and it does not take rocket science to calculate the rise in wages and building materials and subtract it from the rise in house prices. The remainder is entirely a reward for speculation.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">We have just dealt with the budget and the Estimates and it is extraordinary and a particular hallmark of this Government and the Minister for Finance, the Progressive Democrats captive, that we will never see a proposal for a windfall tax. We will never see a proposal which discommodes speculators. In fact, the Minister frequently embarrassed himself as he moved between his five budgets fiddling around with capital gains tax saying that if speculators did not yield the land they were hoarding, he would come after them with a change to capital gains tax. This, however, did not happen. This continual bending of the knee to speculative activity in housing is obscene. Most people of the left and centre in politics and of different generations looking at what is happening in housing are disgusted.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I refer to the capping of the rent allowance. Let us think about what will happen to the type of people who come into the advice centre in my city. A huge obstruction is already placed in the way of single mothers, for example, seeking rented accommodation. If one looks at the columns of <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> or the <i>Galway Advertiser,</i> one will frequently see the words “suitable for professional couple” in brackets. These people already face a huge problem finding any accommodation and now if the rent for a flat or an apartment, if one is in a different social class, goes over a certain figure, they lose the rent allowance altogether. This is being sold as an attempt to reduce inflation in the rental sector but once again, it is the most vulnerable sector pushing a pram which has to carry the cost of this new thinking. There is no attempt to ensure the burden is carried by those who are well able to carry it.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Deputy Grealish and others went to meetings on housing with me at which they affected a certain kind of concern. They were going to lead a revolution on the first time buyer's grant but that quickly evaporated. What I find quite extraordinary is how they can pretend not to understand what is happening in housing. When I started in politics there were people in Galway who owned two or three houses but then five or ten years ago, they owned five or six. There are people now who own 20 houses. During the passage of previous legislation I challenged the Government to initiate a property survey but that will never happen. As I pointed out on that occasion, when we had a wealth tax, it was consistently opposed not because of its inadequate yield or operation but because of what it would reveal.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">There are two simple issues at the heart of the Labour Party proposal this evening – to annul the order to end the first time buyer's grant and, much more importantly, to end this extraordinary and vicious discrimination against the most vulnerable people in the rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">These tenants, who see these advertisements structured in a way which excludes them, are to lose their rent allowance if their rent goes over a certain figure. Up to November they could have supplemented the grant, which is €115 in the Western Health Board area, but they can no longer do that. There was no rush, for example, to provide them with any rights as tenants but at the same time, the Construction Industry Federation strike had to be resolved quickly because most of the members in that organisation know exactly the parties to which they can go and the answer they will get. People looking on at what is happening in housing are looking at a litany of shafts directed against the poorest in terms of housing provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">To take one's total earning life and the proportion of total income one will pay for the right to have a house, one must not only add on the increase between years, as the market is allowed to have speculators at its heart, but must look at how much of one's life is stolen by a mixture of speculators in the provision and unqualified usury to the end of one's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">If one looks at the efforts people are trying to make within the differing categories of housing, it has an immense social effect. People no longer have the choice to decide whether one partner or both will take part in what is the remunerative economy. I do not want to have the argument again about the garda and the nurse as it seems to upset the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, who finds them buying houses against the odds, but leaving that aside, both have little capacity to purchase a house. People are leaving their homes at the crack of dawn and are driving long distances to work. Their children have to be looked after in a country which has an under developed State child care system and they are missing from their communities. They are worn out and do not have time for voluntary activity. What is happening is a nightmare.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I would like a genuine defence from the Government on what it is doing. It says the market will solve all of this and that all interventions will be on the supply side. It has changed its mind with the first, the second and the third Bacon reports. There can be Bacon 17 as far as I am concerned, but when it comes to legislation, it took the Government more than three years to prepare legislation which will protect tenants but it could provide legislation which answers a section within the CIF within a few weeks. I find that quite extraordinary. The Government seems to be quite oblivious to what is happening in every town and city in relation to housing. There used to be talk about all the emigrants coming  back – after all de Valera exported 55,000 of them in 1955. Emigrants spoke about coming home to spend the end of their lives here but no one can consider moving back to Ireland in a highly speculative market. We have allowed a privileged group of rapacious people with no social conscience to viciously exploit the right to housing and shelter in the name of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I wish I had more time to speak. We need more time to know that what begins at the top runs right through all aspects of housing. The Taoiseach, who is back from Copenhagen, said we are becoming one of the richest countries in Europe and that we might even be the second richest – so much richer than the countries joining – yet at the same time, the number of people sleeping on the streets has practically doubled. The Government should be ashamed of itself on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">I did not interrupt anybody. Since 1997 there has been a substantial change in the market. Interest rates, which were historically high, have crashed through the floor and Ireland has moved from mass emigration to net immigration. Our economic well-being has been transformed with unemployment reducing from 17% to 4.5%. Consequently, there was a significant upsurge in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Everybody accepts a button could not be pressed to deliver housing overnight but housing stock has been increased to a level that almost meets demand. I agree with Deputy Higgins's comments on the private rented sector, although Deputy Gilmore is intent on misquoting me. Only 12% of total housing is available for rent, which is too low, and that was driving up rental costs. Deputy Higgins pointed out rental costs were going through the roof on the basis that there was not enough houses available. However, anyone who listened to the programme the other morning would have heard that rents were reducing—</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I am pleased to open the Government's response to the motion. We are not facing the worst housing crisis since the foundation of the State. When the Labour Party was in Government in the mid-1980s housing output fell year after year until fewer than 20,000 houses were being built per year. There was not only a housing crisis when the Labour Party was in Government, there was also a full blown economic crisis and mass emigration.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">I am happy to engage in a substantive debate but the bottom line is I want to create housing stock, particularly for those in the social and affordable sector. I have no other interest. I probably understand the market as well as anybody else as I was an auctioneer in the 1970s and 1980s. I am not an expert but I have a handle on it and I have dealt with those who have had tremendous difficulty getting into the market. That is my underpinning motivation in all this.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Our rapid economic and population growth has meant that even with housing output at record levels never seen in this country and unique in European terms in regard to population, we still are stretched to meet ever growing demand for housing. The Government will never shy away from its responsibilities in regard to housing. We have a proud record of achievement in delivering housing across the broad spectrum of housing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Since 1997, our efforts have generated a substantial increase in output, with a consequent moderation in the increase in house prices. A total of 52,602 new houses were completed in 2001, another record year, while 2002 is shaping up the same way with last year's figure likely to be surpassed. The overall objective of the Government is to maintain these record levels of output to satisfy projected housing demand. I emphasise in excess of 50,000 houses need to be built each year for the next ten years and I intend to ensure we deliver them.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">We have a proud tradition of home ownership in Ireland and I feel strongly about maintaining and promoting this tradition. I recognise we must improve affordability in line with increasing supply and our policy is focused on this. We must get as many people as possible onto the first rung of the housing ladder. A feature of Government's efforts in recent years has been the diversification of instruments and increased support for new forms of housing provision such as voluntary and affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">One such measure is the housing supply provisions, commonly referred to as Part V, of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Part V is based on the principle that there should be some benefit to the community arising from a decision of a local authority to zone land for residential development, thereby increasing the value of that land. Part V, therefore, provides that in certain circumstances up to 20% of residential zoned land should as a condition for the granting of planning permission be made available to the local authority at existing land use value.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I listened with great interest to Deputy Lynch's comments on Cork City Council's approach. Local authorities adopt different approaches and it is up to each one to decide the way it wants to go. Some local authorities have opted for 8% social housing and 7% affordable housing rather than 20% social and affordable housing while others have opted for 15% social housing and 5% affordable housing, as the Deputy stated. However, that is local democracy and it should be up to each local authority to choose for itself and maximise its needs. That is not a decision for myself or the Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_631">I have created the basis for local democracy to work. Some local authorities are doing well in this area and that is reflected in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">These Government measures were welcomed by all sides of the House when the Planning and Development Bill, 2000 was passed with all-party support. Following from the adoption of housing strategies and the variation of development plans to incorporate the strategies, local authorities and builders set about implementing the new regime. Like all new arrangements, it has taken time to bed down and various practical problems were identified, most notably that planning permissions for 80,000 housing units could be wiped out starting at the end of this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The Government was aware of the difficulties and decided that something must be done both to ensure continued housing supply at high levels and the smooth operation of the new procedures. We, therefore, as promised in the Agreed Programme for Government, initiated an urgent review of Part V to ensure it was meeting its objectives on social and affordable housing. We  had received many complaints that the system was inflexible and overly bureaucratic, not only from developers but also from local authorities, all of whom contacted me in this regard because it appeared to be slowing down supply, which was the opposite of what was intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The review was not carried out too early. The Government decided it was imperative that the review should be carried out at this stage so that any necessary changes to improve the system could be made now to ensure continued supply of good affordable housing. To do nothing and wait to see how the figures panned out over the next year, hoping that the number of units delivered would increase, was never an option and would have been seen as a failure by the Government to deal with a real and serious issue. I have no doubt if I had done so the same Members who have contributed to the debate would have been questioning me in six months regarding how I allowed a disaster to occur in the housing market in terms of supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The review, which was conducted with all key stakeholders, reached important conclusions on which there was a general consensus. There were two key points. First, the provisions of Part V in making housing strategies, and the requirement to zone sufficient land for residential development in particular, were widely regarded as positive. However, stake holders also argued for increased flexibility and less bureaucracy in the operation of the provisions of Part V. Naturally, the impact of the provision regarding the withering of planning permissions was a major concern for all stake holders. The changes in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002, are specifically designed to meet the concerns about bureaucracy and flexibility and the withering provision expressed in the review and thereby boost housing supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The 2000 Act provided that permissions for residential development granted after 25 August 1999 but before a housing strategy was included in the relevant development plan, and to which Part V of the Act would have applied had the housing strategy been incorporated, would last until 31 December 2002 or for two years from the date of the grant of planning permission, whichever was longer. Planning permission would expire for those houses within the development for which the external walls had not been built by the relevant date. Accordingly, planning permissions for about 44,000 houses was due to wither on 31 December 2002 and permissions for 36,000 more would wither in 2003. The loss of planning approval for about 80,000 houses would have a serious negative impact on housing supply in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">There seems to be a total misunderstanding here. I cannot accept the suggestion that our approach in the amending Bill will somehow cost local authorities €1 billion to build the houses which would have been delivered through the Part V mechanism. There is no basis for this assertion. First, if they were permitted to wither,  and we waited for developers to re-apply, we would have an immediate supply problem. More important, the Labour Party seems to think the houses were to be provided free to local authorities under Part V and this is not the case. In fact full market value would have had to be paid for these houses—</p>

          <p eId="para_665">The Government is committed to making Part V work and I reject totally the Labour party assertion that the proposed changes outlined in the amending Bill are an abandonment of the social and affordable provisions of the 2000 Act – quite the opposite in fact. My aim is to remove obstacles and to make Part V work to ensure a continued good supply of housing, which is the only way to improve affordability. The changes proposed are designed to make the system operate more efficiently and effectively, to eliminate the rigidities that were slowing down supply, to bring more social and affordable housing on stream more quickly, while continuing to promote social integration.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">The Government's job is to govern. That means taking action where action is necessary: actions like the ones taken to balance supply and demand for housing and actions which have given us stability in house prices. However, as we took those actions, we knew that we must also lay the foundations for a fairer housing system. In Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, radical measures were taken to meet the housing needs of people on low and middle incomes. These measures have been consolidated by those contained in the amending Bill to ensure that Part V can deliver for a greater number of those in need of housing than heretofore. Part V alone will make an enormous difference to first time house buyers and those who need social housing. It secures for us a bright future of mixed housing, stability and civilised living and provides access to housing for those who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The Government's commitment in the housing  area is paying off. Output is up and price increases have moderated. Social housing is being delivered at the highest levels in a generation. The amending motion briefly sets out Government achievements in relation to housing and I call on the continued support of the House for our actions, particularly those focusing on responding to the needs of low income households and those with special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">For these reasons and others to which my colleagues will refer, I am happy to commend the Government's amendment to the House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_673">In launching the 2003 Estimates, the Government acknowledged that difficult decisions had to be made in terms of spending priorities. We have learned from the inaction of those here opposite in the mid-1980s that to do anything less would be irresponsible at a time when the world-wide economic slowdown in growth is impacting adversely on Ireland and our public expenditure is running ahead of tax yields.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The Government nonetheless remains determined to respond effectively to the broad range of housing needs, particularly the needs of lower income groups. We have also continued in this term of office with the measures which we initiated in our previous term to increase the supply of housing and bring moderation to the rate of house price increases, including increasing investment in the provision of serviced land for housing and more effective use of that land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Contrary to what the Labour Party would have us believe it is clear that these policies have been effective in dealing with the impact of the unprecedented demand for housing in recent years. In 2001 a record number of houses were built, with 52,602 units of which 47,727 were built by the private sector. At 13 houses per 1,000 of population this was the highest rate of house construction in the European Union in proportion to population and about four times the rate in the UK. When the new house grants scheme was introduced in its present form in 1977 to encourage new house building, about 17,000 new private houses were being built. I am pleased to say that housing output continues to increase in 2002 with particularly marked increases in Dublin and the greater Dublin area. Would the Labour Party have us reverse the policies which have caused us to achieve such remarkable output figures?</p>
          <p eId="para_676">This increase in supply of houses together with other Government interventions has brought greater stability to the housing market and moderation in the rate of average house price increases which at their peak in 1998 were increasing at 40% per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">In addition to specific housing measures, the general improvement in employment and increases in disposable income resulting from  economic growth, lower interest rates and tax reductions, assisted many individuals in purchasing their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">This Government has a strong commitment to respond to those in need of social housing and those with special needs. We have to target our resources wisely to meet this demand. In recent years a range of better targeted schemes to assist low income purchasers and those with social housing needs have been put in place. Between 1991 and 2001, the provision of social and affordable housing has grown by 35% to 11,385 units and a further increase to almost 13,000 units is forecast in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">I anticipate that local authority housing output this year will be the highest for over 15 years at 5,500 units and the output of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector is likely to reach an all-time record level at 1,500 units.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Activity is also increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. In the first nine months of 2002, 598 homes were completed under the affordable housing scheme and a further 2,116 units were in progress at the end of last September. Local authorities assisted 1,276 households with shared ownership homes in the first nine months of 2002. The prospects are good for substantial growth in activity in 2003. It is clear that apart from these schemes the house building industry is also responding to the need for more affordable housing with an increased supply of more affordable homes coming on stream, particularly in the greater Dublin area during this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">There are also increasing examples of the public and private sectors working together in innovative ways to address the needs of lower income groups. In 2000, Fingal County Council invited proposals for the design and construction, by way of a public private partnership, of integrated housing using innovative building systems on a 44 acre site owned by the council close to Mulhuddart village. The development will consist of 726 residential units comprising 431 affordable units, 105 social units and 190 private units. The scheme also includes a community centre and child care facility. Phase one of the scheme which consists of affordable units only was launched by Fingal County Council in early May 2002. Dublin City Council has entered into an arrangement in relation to a site in Cherry Orchard which consists of 374 residential units and also includes a child care facility. Dublin City Council will buy 30% of the units at cost price for applicants qualifying for affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">These are just an example of innovative responses being developed to respond in the broadest way to housing needs and focusing on the needs of low income groups and those in need of social housing. The Department will continue to encourage and support local authorities in developing these responses to housing needs in their areas. This will result in good living environments and sustainable communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The need to do so also informed our review of  the Part V provisions which the Minister, Deputy Cullen, has already elaborated upon in the House tonight. Our objective is to ensure that the provisions of Part V meet the original objective with particular reference to social and affordable housing. The new provisions contained in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002 will ensure that increasing numbers of social and affordable housing units will be achieved in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">We must consolidate the substantial progress made in increasing housing output and responding to those most in need. In 2003, total capital funding for housing, both Exchequer and non-Exchequer, will be up 7% to €1.7 billion on the amount provided in 2002. This is almost double the spending in 2000. Our priority is to respond to those most in need. The provisions available for social rented accommodation are likely to allow for some increased starts under the local authority programme and for the voluntary and co-operative sector to continue its increased contribution to social housing as envisaged under the NDP. The provisions also allow for the continued increase in activity under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">While I appreciate that difficult decisions have to be taken which may cause disappointment for some, our focus must now be on the more targeted schemes and particularly the housing needs of the lower income groups. I seek the support of the House in our efforts to provide for the housing needs of those groups.</p>

          <from>Mr Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_689">The Minister used 1997 as a base line and I wish to remind him that since 1997 the numbers on local authority waiting lists have doubled, the price of new houses has increased by 79% and the rents in the private sector have effectively doubled. I do not think the Minister has too much to crow about.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Despite all the comments, the record shows that the Government promised to control the rise in house prices and it failed. The Government promised to increase the first-time buyer's grant to €6,350 for couples but they wiped it out instead. They promised to accelerate dramatically the supply of new houses but they failed. They promised an expansion of the social housing programmes but there is very little evidence of it. They promised to implement a full package of reforms in the rented accommodation sector arising from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector but they have failed to do so. They promised to ensure a comprehensive strategy for the homeless. The strategy has been  published but it has not been implemented in any way. We have only to walk around the cities and towns to see how things are. They promised to ensure the implementation of local authority Traveller accommodation plans but there is very little evidence of that. They promised to streamline the approval procedures for the local authority house building projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">In my 23 years in politics I have never seen so much damage inflicted on people aspiring to purchase their own home as I have seen in recent weeks. I have been involved in many campaigns but I have never seen a response like that which I got in recent weeks from people in the streets of my own city, and never heard the like of the disgust and anger of people to the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">We in Fine Gael initiated a petition, "Give It Back", and we got almost 70,000 names from people demanding that this Government restores the first-time buyer's grant. The petition asked the Government if it could not see its way to restoring the grant to double mortgage interest relief to first-time buyers for the first five years of the loan. The value to the buyer would be €12,700 over five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">I thought this was a caring and listening Government. Instead of listening to the people and to those who signed the petition Fine Gael organised, the Government went the other way and in the budget of 6 December last increased the VAT on houses by a further 1%. This meant that over €6,000 was added to the price of a €200,000 house. The housing market has almost become the full preserve of private investors and the prospects of young people getting their own home are diminishing by the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">We demanded and got the support of 70,000 Irish people for the proposal that mortgage interest relief be doubled for first-time buyers. I am demanding tonight, in support of the Labour Party motion, that young people be given the opportunity to buy their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Earlier the Minister denied an assertion by Deputy Lynch that the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and the 1% VAT increase is impacting on the affordable housing scheme. That is happening in Cork where 700 people applied for 42 houses. I have further evidence here. For example, Deputy Paul McGrath stated that he has confirmation from the Minister's Department that none of the 61 families who are to be sold houses under the affordable housing scheme in Mullingar will receive the first-time buyer's grant and they will also be slapped with the VAT increase of 1%. The houses concerned cost €120,000 and €114,000 respectively so the increased cost will be substantial. They will have to pay an extra €1,200 in VAT and they will lose out on the first-time buyer's grant of €3,800. The total loss to those people will be €5,000. These people are on the borderline. If they fail to get a house under the affordable housing scheme, they will go onto the local authority lists on which  there are 100,000 names. That list has doubled since 1997.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_327">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_696">I congratulate the Labour Party on tabling this motion. There is one certainty about this debate, no Government in the 25 years that I am a Member, and I am in the House longer than Deputy Allen, handled a crisis in housing so badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">When I heard the Minister, Deputy Cullen, speak earlier and I am sorry he is not present now to hear this, he was all perked up about the initiative he was introducing. I have no way of knowing whether what he is doing will solve the problem and I am not too sure anybody else knows either, but I was in this position two or three years ago and heard his colleague and predecessor Minister, Deputy Dempsey, speak with equal eloquence on that occasion. Listening to him, you would have thought that he was able to solve the housing crisis there and then. He quoted Bacon at length and Part V was the answer. There was no doubt about it. The Government went down that road and, as it turned out, it was a cul de sac. It was a disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">How can we or young people have any confidence in the Minister? The only ambition that teeming thousands of young couples have is to own a house, whether privately, under the affordable housing scheme or in some other way. How can we take the Minister, Deputy Cullen, at his word, given that the same two parties in Government in the past couple of years had to reverse the engine so dramatically? Who is to say whether in two years' time some other Minister will be there?</p>
          <p eId="para_699">It is all right for a Minister to make a mistake but the consequences affect many thousands of young people. That is the real difficulty. The Government is stumbling from one solution to another while the problem is getting worse by the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I have been a member of Galway County Council for a long time. Usually the number of people on the council waiting list fluctuates from 500 to 700. Last week there were 1,350 people in the county council area who did not have a roof over their heads and had nowhere to get one unless it was supplied by Galway County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, spoke about the high level of house starts and finishes. I acknowledge that there have been a good number of houses built, but in the context of the number of people looking for houses it is the worst attempt to solve the problem in the past ten years. If we do no better next year and the year after than we did in the past two or three years, many of those 1,350 people will not get a house for five or six years. Imagine the pressure which will be put on the private rented sector, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, etc., all because the Government did not do its job and ensure that there was the necessary supply of housing, which could have been foreseen?</p>
          <p eId="para_702">To add insult to injury, in the budget the Mini ster for Finance decided to have a go at young people. He insulted everyone aspiring to build or buy his or her own house. He tried to put it across that €3,800 is not a lot of money. That is what he said. It is a huge amount of money to a couple who do not have any. In the case of affordable housing, the first-time buyer's grant was tailor-made for a deposit on a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I was also out on the streets. It is not often that we do this in east Galway. I will never forget standing outside Tesco's in Ballinasloe for three or four hours last Saturday fortnight. People who never voted for me in their lives – in my constituency, if they did not vote for me they voted for Fianna Fáil – lined up to sign that form. They wanted to see if they could write to the Minister saying that they were disgusted with what was in the budget a few days previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The Government has lost the run of itself. Because it is so long in power it does not understand the problems young people experience when they get to a certain stage in life where they want to own a home, which is a normal aspiration. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, knows as well as I that if anything happens in the next couple of years to force a rise in interest rates, and this Government, no more than any other, has little to do with the current rates we are enjoying because it is a European Union matter, there will be problems in this country the like of which we have never seen in 25 years. What is going on is shameful. Unless the Government gets down to business, it will get its answer in June 2004 when people next have a chance to vote. I believe it will get a strong response to this then.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_705">I listened with interest to the Minister and the Minister of State. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, said that between 1998 and 2001, the provision of social and affordable housing grew by 35%. He also said he anticipates that the level of local authority housing provision this year will be the highest in over 15 years, at 5,500 units. If that is the case, why is the Government abandoning the 20% social housing clause introduced in 2000? If it is not broken, why does the Government want to fix it? This puzzles me.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Deputies Allen and Connaughton talked about the real anger of people after the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. In the past five years, the average price of a house in Galway city has increased by 100%, from €100,000 to €200,000. I watched with interest the counterfeit anger of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats backbenchers when the Book of Estimates first indicated that the Minister of Finance planned to abolish the first-time buyer's grant. They went on local radio, on "Liveline" and elsewhere to screech and roar about what they would do about it. They were obviously called aside and told not to worry, that the Minister for Finance would fix the matter in the budget with mortgage interest relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The week before the budget these people  issued statements to local newspapers demanding that the Minister for Finance provide mortgage interest relief in the budget. It was an exercise in political science to watch the backbenchers in this House on budget day. They flicked through copies of the Minister's speech in anticipation of what he would say. They reached page 14 and read very quickly the two short paragraphs providing that the current annual ceiling for mortgage interest relief would be raised by over one quarter to €4,000 for a single person and €8,000 for a married couple. They saw those magic figures and looked like gun dogs setting as if they were going to raise a pheasant.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">When the Minister came to page 14 the applause was lead by Deputy O'Flynn, one of the greatest opponents of the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant the week previously. They failed to realise that instead of a pheasant, they had merely raised a curlew. They realised afterwards that the mortgage interest relief would only give a person €325 annually over seven years, which in no way compensates for the loss of the €3,800 first-time buyer's grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">To add insult to injury, a day or two after the budget, the Minister for Finance announced a change in the VAT rate from 12.5% to 13% that would apply to housing materials. It would also affect new home buyers to the tune of up to €1,500 on a very modestly priced house or €2,000 on a €200,000 house. I have a letter here that first-time buyers from my constituency received from their solicitor concerning the purchase of a very moderately priced property in Dublin. It states: "Owing to the increase in VAT in the recent budget, we confirm that the purchase price of the above-mentioned house has now increased by €1, 580.43."  That is the size of the increase on a modest, one bedroom, €170,000 apartment in Dublin. If that was a two or three-bedroom house, these people would be subjected to a possible increase of €2,000 or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">On top of that a buyer trying to get on the first rung of the property ladder lost the first-time buyer's grant of €3,800 because he or she did not have the contract signed before the Book of Estimates was published. These people must now consider whether they will be able to go ahead with their commitments. No matter how you play with the figures, this is a penalty of over €2,000 on young buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I listened with interest to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, before he left the Chamber. I thought I was in a labour ward when I came in, he talked so much about what he is delivering. All he delivered to his backbenchers, aided by the Minister for Finance, was a dummy. After the anger expressed to the backbenchers at their homes, clinics and elsewhere in the week prior to the budget, the Minister sold them a dummy by telling them not to worry, that the Government would make it up to them in the budget by increasing mortgage interest relief. They were so naive in buying the dummy that they erupted into  applause in the House on budget day. They failed to realise on the day that mortgage interest relief would not in any way compensate for the loss of the first-time buyer's grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Housing waiting lists are getting longer. There are more than 2,000 people on the Galway city housing waiting list now, and the average wait is five years. In addition, people can no longer obtain a disabled person's grant, an essential repairs grant or a repairs for the elderly grant in Galway city because there is no money to meet requirements. There is not even enough money to provide travel expenses to the health board officers who go out to examine applications. These grants are essential in urban and rural areas. They help people to maintain a house in some reasonable order for the rest of their days. They are among the most essential and worthy grants that could be available, but they have all been cancelled because the money is no longer there to fund them.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The Minister, Deputy Cullen, comes into this House and preaches to the Opposition and everybody else. He ought to take his own backbenchers aside and explain to them what has been done. They will be conned again this time. They bought the promise on mortgage interest relief, hoping and expecting that it would compensate for the loss of the first-time buyer's grant. The budget speech was cleverly written to gain their applause on the day and ensure they would not realise how little the mortgage interest relief would actually give to a person. Page 14 merely referred to what the rates were being increased from –€3,175 for a single person and €6,350 for a married person, giving the impression that this was the size of the actual increase in mortgage interest relief. Everybody clapped and went home happy.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_716">In page 3, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_717">2.–The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of increasing child benefit, pensions and other social welfare payments in line with previously stated  Government policy commitments, including the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and the Programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">We indicated on Second and Committee Stages our unhappiness about some of the increases in social welfare benefits. People claim the Minister looked after the pensioners with a €10 increase but she must realise that a significant amount of this will be eaten away by inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The Minister explained that the 4.8% was predicated on a levelling of inflation over a period of a year but already the indications from some of the leading financial houses in town, whose business is to get predictions on inflation right, are that the January rate of inflation could be 6% or more. There is, therefore, a significant erosion of the income of our most vulnerable people. They also have greater dependence on heating and other basic services and do not have the same options as people who are more mobile and so forth. This is particularly so in rural areas, where the free travel pass is not much use because people do not have access to transport. Immobility in rural areas is a huge problem. In many cases the €10 could be eaten up by the price of a taxi to bring the person into town to collect their pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The Minister indicated that a €1 increase would cost a significant amount of money. I have forgotten the figure – the Minister will probably mention it again – but I was taken aback by the amount. However, we contended that there are ancillary elements in the free schemes which would be of benefit to these people. In particular, we advocated a voucher system that would allow people in rural areas to avail of a taxi and other transport services in those areas. The Government has allocated €500,000 to the rural transport initiative, which I applaud. It should be the first of many steps to try to help people in these areas. For many elderly people in rural areas receipt of the free travel pass might be the first contact they have with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, for many it also gathers dust as it lies behind a photograph on the mantelpiece or in a drawer. It is of no use where there is no public transport available, be it buses or trains. We are seeking a report in this area to examine if there is a possibility of widening some of these schemes so they can be made more useful to people in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Over the coming months the Combat Poverty Agency's recent publication, "Against all odds, Family Life on a Low Income in Ireland", will be studied by everybody. The social and family affairs committee will look at it and, no doubt, many Members will wish to contribute to that debate. I am sure the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will also look at it. The report deals with the lives of people living on social welfare payments. Often people who are on the left of the political spectrum, and I see many such colleagues in the Chamber tonight, are described as being part of the poverty lobby, pinkos, left pinkos or other  such names. Some people would call them derogatory terms but to me they are terms of endearment because we look after a group of people who need a voice to articulate their views. We are not afraid to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The Combat Poverty Agency shows that a significant number of people have not benefited or made gains from the wealth created during the past six or seven years. The Minister has provided €6 to bring the lowest social welfare payment to €124.80 but that falls short of the PPF commitment to bring the payment to €127 during that period. The Minister has argued that the increase is more than inflation but that does not take account of the fact that people on lower incomes face higher than average costs due to their lower purchasing power and lack of private transport. These factors must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The Minister also made changes to the rent supplements and the discretion of the health boards, superintendent community welfare officers and community welfare officers to deal with rent supplements. She used secondary legislation, that is, statutory instrument, to do this. I believe there is a flaw in the secondary legislation and that it should be examined in the context of the primary legislation, section 266 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, to ensure it is not <i>ultra vires.</i> In any event, about €4.80 of that €6 will be clawed back immediately because of the increase in the basic rate of contribution. In fairness, the Minister said the reason for that is that it is 10% of the basic rate of social welfare that is now applicable. However, it will reduce people on that rate to €120. When one adds the 1% increase in VAT, it is a wipe out. Many of the Minister's colleagues dismissed us during the debate on the budget and said we were using crazy economics. However, that is where Fr. Seán Healy and CORI got their figure of 25 cent per week. One does not need to be a rocket scientist or a great economist to arrive at that figure, particularly if people are in rented accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The greatest fear about that provision is that it will hit single people hardest and increase the level of homelessness, which is running at about 6,000 throughout the country. It exists in rural areas as well as urban areas. These changes must be combined with a 30% increase in electricity charges. Many pensioners and people in social welfare schemes will have free electricity units but that only applies to a certain level. Any usage above that attracts the increase which will eat into one's income.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">A significant number of the changes and increases made by the Minister will be clawed back. People will be left in either a static situation or poorer. With regard to child benefit, the Minister said it is a start. Child benefit is advocated by all agencies as the means of ensuring the mother receives the money and uses it. That is one of the reasons the Minister said it would not be means tested. I can understand the Minister's attitude in that regard. Nevertheless, a commitment was  given and many people felt disappointed and short changed when it was not delivered. I agree with the Minister that it is an effective way of supporting children and does not contribute to disincentives or poverty traps. It is targeted and focused. Barnardos, the Children's Alliance and the community platform have advocated it as an important means of supporting children, especially in a context where the child dependant allowance has remained static for the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Widows and widowers under 66 feel hard done by and have complained bitterly that there is no increase in this area as many of them have a young person going to college.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I am surprised by the volume of correspondence I have already received in the short time since I became Labour Party spokesperson on social and family affairs. People are much aggrieved at the post-budget situation which has had a big impact in real terms. We have to focus on this area in future. Unfortunately, we are precluded from making any proposals that would cost the Minister money.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The NAPS report and the Goodbody review exist, as do many others, but they need to be acted on. The income adequacy group proposed that formal links be established between the adult welfare rates and average earnings. If this had been accepted it would have protected the income of social welfare recipients. I am aware that there are two views on the NAPS report. If one wishes to build an inclusive society, as the Government claims it does, then such a step must be taken. Smoke and mirrors were evident in the poverty-proofing test applied to the budget by the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The budget was characterised by highly regressive indirect tax increases such as VAT and excise duties. These have the greatest impact on the poor. When all the budgetary implications are calculated the poor will not be smiling in 2003.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_745">I will do that. I wish to speak in regard to the €6 increase in unemployment benefit. Since the budget was announced, we appear to have a budget almost every day. A social welfare recipient contacted my office today in a state of great distress. The constituent was inquiring when the local authorities would pay out third level grants because the money was required to pay in advance for the constituent's child's student accommodation. I have not seen that happen for many years. It is a sign of the current tough times.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">People tell me they cannot manage on social welfare payments. Grocery items seem to increase on a daily basis and that will be further exacerbated in the new year when the budget increases in respect of VAT kick in. There was an €8 per month increase in child benefit. That is €2 per week or €1.75 in a five week month. With inflation running at 6% and foodstuff increasing on a daily basis that increase has been wiped out. The Minister and her Department must commission a report on the effects of these increases on social welfare recipients.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Does the Minister know how many people on social welfare read <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>? The Minister looked well in it last Sunday as she did in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Saturday. There are other publications over the weekend that many people on social welfare could not afford to buy. The media was quiet on this occasion, which is not often the case. Why is that? The media is the real winner, as €320,000 was paid in the last campaign in regard to PPS. I will table a question to see what it cost to tell people about  the mighty increases they got in social welfare. It cost a lot more to advertise the increases in the paper than the actual value of the increases over a year. I look forward to getting that information.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">The Minister needs to address an anomaly in the system in regard to the free schemes. Deputy Penrose also referred to this. I raised it on Committee Stage. The free transport scheme is no good to people in rural areas because we do not have public services. The Department will have to look at a pass system for people to get a taxi to collect their pension or whatever other payment it may be.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">That must happen quickly. People make the same claim in regard to Dublin's public transport. Every morning people complain about how long it takes to get to work. I heard such a discussion on the radio today.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">In regard to the heating allowance, the health board insists on putting in storage heaters for elderly people. Why will the ESB not give them the units on a monthly basis rather than making them calculate it at the end of the year? That is an anomaly in the system. Elderly people come to their public representatives in despair when they get a large ESB bill. We contact the ESB who reply that the individuals can apply to have it calculated and the calculation arrives after two months. If I am not making the point clearly, I will put it in writing to the Department. I have tabled a question on this matter today. The system is causing great confusion and upset to elderly people because when they get their bills they think they owe a great sum of money. They have to go back to the ESB to have it recalculated before they can get their allowance. The ESB credits them after two months or so. This matter must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The Minister and the Department should have another look at the back to work scheme, one of the few schemes that actually worked.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_755">That is true. The back to work scheme is a great initiative for somebody who has not worked for five years and who wants to get back into the workplace or somebody who wants to start up their own business. They can continue to get 75% of their social welfare payment, then 50% and eventually 25% for the specified period. That scheme gives them the courage and confidence to get back into the workplace, particularly those who have worked in a company for 13 or 16 years. They find themselves unemployed and they want to do something different. They are prepared to take a chance but they cannot because they are afraid they will not have a salary at the end of the week, although at least they will have the back-up of the 75% social welfare pay ment. The Minister should re-examine that scheme.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_760">Consultancy is the fastest growing industry in the country. Consultants made big money but all we got was the same reports reissued, with nothing being implemented as a result of them. Even €4 million is too much. We do not need any more reports. What we want now is real money for people on social welfare. There is great anger among the public because people are feeling the pinch in a big way.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I want to refer to my favourite topic, the home help service, which also comes under the next amendment. I ask the Minister and the Department officials to sit down with the health boards so that people can get the support they need at this stage rather than have them cost the State more money at a later stage in terms of subvention. The Minister should try to keep these people comfortable in their homes. They could be given a small amount of support at a very reasonable price. I know the Minister will examine that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The carer's allowance is the issue that angers many people. There are 100,000 carers of which only 22,000 or 23,000 are drawing down assistance from the State. We have to look at the means test in relation to that scheme because we have to reward the people who are prepared to care for their relatives at home. We have to tell them they do a good job and I ask the Minister to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">There was no increase in the child dependant allowance. This is an area the Minister will have to examine. She will have to bring in a supplementary budget before this year ends because what people are getting on social welfare is being wiped away as a result of daily price increases and inflation. The child dependant allowance will have to be increased. Everybody expected it to be increased to €25 this year but that did not happen, which is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">On the fuel scheme, this country does not get a summer. We get a week or two of fine weather but for the remaining 50 weeks of the year people need to light a fire in their homes. I ask the Minister to look at that scheme again in next year's budget with a view to making it an all year round allowance rather than just the current number of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">People are now beginning to realise a major change is taking place in relation to rent subsidy  in that the 10% will be taken out of their social welfare payment. That will have a knock-on effect and I agree with Deputy Penrose that serious legal problems may arise in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The people I feel badly about are those who receive the Christmas bonus. They should be looked after, even at this late stage. We have the money in the social welfare fund. Last year the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, took €650 million out of the fund. A total of 190,000 people were affected by that. These are the people who are paying into the fund, those on short-term unemployment benefit, carer's benefit and other allowances. These people have the same problems and expenses at Christmas as everybody else. If the Minister has to take the money out of the social welfare fund, so be it. If the Minister could take €650 million out of the fund last year, why not give it to the people who need it most?</p>
          <p eId="para_767">This morning I heard from very annoyed constituents of mine who spent most of their lives living outside this State. A total of 90% of their pension came from contributions paid while living in Britain with the remaining 10% from a non-contributory pension from here. This morning they got the calculation from the Department and the rate is 10%. Does the Minister know of any institution which is prepared to give anyone in this House a rate of 10%? If that were the case many people would be prepared to invest. The way these pensions are being calculated is wrong. These are the people who sent money back to this country in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when there was no euro and no money coming in from the European Union. That money kept this economy and the country alive. They sent money home to their mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters yet when they come home to retire, bringing 90% of their income into the State, we penalise them because of the high price of sterling. No Government did anything about this problem in the past. When sterling was weak nothing was done about it but when sterling got stronger, we took the pound off them. These people are upset by that because they were the people who were educated, or not educated, to leave this State but they did not forget about this State. They sent a lot of money home and it is wrong to attack them now.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">We want this report before the House quickly because there is no doubt that the increases in the budget, some of which will come into effect from 1 January, will have no effect with inflation running now at almost 6% and prices increasing on a daily basis. For the first time in many years, people on social welfare are now feeling the pinch and that is wrong. At a time when the economy is facing a downturn the first people we attack are those on social welfare, which is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">CORI described the budget as unfair, unjust and unacceptable. It described it as a Government insult against the weakest in society, and I agree with that statement.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_770">I strongly support this amendment to the Social Welfare Bill, 2002 because it adds some teeth to it. It is essential that legislation is given the clout to do something practical in people's lives and, above all, to assist the poorer sections of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">It is now generally accepted that a just and fair society is one which protects its most vulnerable members. That is what this Bill should be about and it is what the amendment is about. We need to assess the progress we make in our attacks on poverty, disadvantage and social exclusion. Many of us are often dismissed as idealists when it comes to tackling the nightmare of poverty. We all know the problem cannot be sorted out overnight but we can make major dents in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">For example, 8% of children live in dire poverty. We can tackle that figure head on through education, prioritising funding and assistance for the most needy. I am talking about the most disadvantaged schools like those in the Breaking the Cycle project. We need to tackle the whole housing question and we need immediate economic investment in key areas. We must work from the bottom up and then spread the resources through the broader society.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">This amendment deals with the core issues such as child benefit, pensions and other social welfare payments. These are key elements in any anti-poverty strategy. There is little use in spending thousands of euro on glossy advertisements which refer to social inclusion and create the illusion among our wealthy elite that we are doing something for the less well off in our society when in reality we are bringing in legislation and budgets that kick them in the teeth. An increase of 25 cent a week in 2003 for an unemployed couple with one child is an insult and an attack on their dignity. Someone on €50,000 a year has a €25 a week gap with a single unemployed person. That is not acceptable. That is not tackling poverty and it is not doing anything about social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">We cannot have great debates in the Dáil about amendments to the Social Welfare Bill while at the same time cutting the provision in the Estimates for 2003 for social housing by 5%. What about the reality of having 48,000 people on our housing waiting lists, and the sad case of 6,000 homeless people in our State? If we fail to deal with these issues, politics will have failed our people once again.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Of course, we all accept that welfare payments are not the real solution to the long-term interests of our people. However, they act as a fire brigade service to our poor and should never be removed or decreased. I know members of the Cabinet do not agree with me and seem to delight in cutting back on services. Macho right-wing economics seems to be the order of the day but this is against the nature of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">This amendment also deals with the programme for Government. The sad reality is that it is walking away from its own policies and promises. With inflation and cuts in services we are  stepping backwards. This amendment puts down a marker and demands a report on the implications. It may not be good enough for many of us but we have no real option but to support it. I urge all Deputies to support this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanRyan" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_777">A very strong case for this amendment has already been put forward. The best mechanism for dealing with poverty is the Social Welfare Bill. I do not see why the Government should reject this amendment. We are trying to make the best of dealing with the choices that have to be made this year and in the future. The best way to do this is to look at the commitments entered into in the programme for Government and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and by making the information available. The data should be collected and costings should be put on the programmes. This will be very important in the context of the discussions that are to take place in the coming days and I hope agreement can be reached in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">How can we expect ordinary people to trust the promises made by any Government? As we debate this Bill, there are thousands of people who do not own homes. Up to 200,000 people – 6% of the population – live in constant poverty and this is after the most economically successful years in the history of this State. Irrespective of the hype in the weekend newspapers, the standard of living for those dependent on social welfare has not improved and it has got worse for some. I acknowledge that some progress has been made in the circumstances of old age pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The Minister said she had to make choices. There are people who meet with the Minister for Finance every year and make a pre-budget submission, which the Minister for Finance throws into the wastepaper basket. We must look at the commitments made, they must be costed and a plan for implementing them put in place. I accept the Minister's commitment to the people for whom she is responsible but I know there are other members of the Government who do not share her commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">This amendment will not put any additional burden on the Exchequer. It seeks to move matters forward in a concerted manner so that real choices can be made in how we are to advance the area of welfare in order to eliminate poverty in the next couple of years. Given the promises it has made, and broken, it is the least the Government can do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_781">I strongly support this amendment. The €10 increase in the old age pension and the €7 increase in social welfare are not real increases. All of the increase is taken from the recipient because of the policies and announcements of the Government. The benefit of the slight increase has gone because of the increase in VAT. Old age pensioners living in local authority housing will find their rent increased relative to the increase of their income at the next review.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I saw the full-page advertisements carried in the newspapers. The Department has spent a large amount of money publicising the changes made in the budget. There is no need for the daily and Sunday papers to carry full-page colour advertisements. There is a nice photograph of the Minister and a family in one of the advertisements. I do not know if it is her family or someone else's. Social welfare recipients are paying for those advertisements as they are funded from the Department's budget. The morality of placing such advertisements is questionable. Those advertisements are worth hundreds of thousands of euro to the newspapers. It could be seen as a form of inducement not to criticise the budget. I do not know whether that is the case but the public might wonder how the newspapers could give a critical analysis of the budget given that the Department is placing so many advertisements. It is like a political party placing an advertisement at the time of a general election; they place them to ensure the local paper will write a good piece in other respects. No votes will be won by advertisements. I am sure there is no value to social welfare recipients in placing such advertisements, whatever their value to the Government. It is a policy that should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I am very concerned about the back to work scheme and the requirement for five years unemployment beforehand. Previous to this, people on social welfare had an incentive to look for work and would retain 75% of their benefit in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year, and their secondary benefits. It was also important for people in receipt of disability allowance or benefit who were rehabilitating themselves and who were nervous about returning to work, to have this incentive to encourage them to return to work. Returning to work can give a purpose in life to a person suffering from depression as a result of an accident or for some other reason. I do not know whether a person must be in receipt of disability benefit for three or five years before he or she can qualify to participate in a back to work scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Prior to this, a person only had to be in receipt of a benefit or a social welfare allowance for 15 months to quality for participation. Now a person in receipt of an ordinary social welfare benefit rate must wait five years before he or she can qualify. It is difficult for anyone who is out of the workforce, even out of the Dáil, for five years to return to it. I have not had that experience yet and maybe I will survive without it.</p>

It was a retrograde  step to increase the length of time that a person must be in receipt of social welfare benefit to qualify to participate in a back to work scheme. I feel strongly about this issue and about the provision in respect of the carer's allowance. The work of carers is not fully appreciated.

          <p eId="para_794">The Minister will be aware that the greatest disappointment with this Bill has been expressed by NGOs and charities working for children and children's welfare. If anything should be taken as a damning criticism, that should be. In replies to parliamentary questions since the Dáil was convened, the Minister talked about the inability to address issues such as child dependant allowances, perhaps putting the allowances into one standardised payment or reassessing them in terms of age ranges. We were promised that the third instalment of the child benefit increase would be looked after, but following the budget we know it has not been. That constitutes a grave breach of promise by the Minister and the Government. I cannot understand why the advice by the Department of Finance on the special savings investment scheme is that no changes can be made because they would be seen to undermine investor confidence when promises made to people who depend on social welfare payments can be abolished at a moment's notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">We have a major problem in terms of child poverty. We perform poorly on many international listings. It had been hoped that the budget and this Bill would be a way of responding to this problem, but unfortunately we have gone backwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Other speakers mentioned that the inflationary aspect of what is happening in the economy and what will result from the budget means that the increases given are worthless. We have an inflation rate of 4.8%. The Minister for Finance, in his budget speech, said that the effect of the measures he was proposing would be the best part of an additional 1%, 0.856%, on top of the consumer price index. The inflation rate will be 5.6% or 5.7%, which does not take account of the underlying factors that will come into play as a result of the budget. The social welfare increases that have been proposed are negative in terms of every person who is dependent on social welfare benefit. Those in difficult family situations, particularly children, will be worse off as a result of the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Minister's Department supplied us today with a handsome publication entitled "Contemporary Family Policy". It appears to have been prepared at the behest and with the approval of the Department. It states that matters have improved greatly in the Department over the year in terms of addressing family policy in welfare payments. Ireland contrasts poorly with the other countries that were part of that study. They included, France, Sweden, Italy and the UK. The publication states that while Ireland had improved it was still behind. I presume it was completed before the budget was delivered. If those authors were to revisit the study, we would be seen to be going backwards yet again.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Unlike other speakers, I have no difficulty with public advertising of the effects of the budgetary changes. There is an important role in making people aware of the changes that come about as a result of the budget. There was almost a clawback in the Department of Social Welfare under previous Governments as a result of people being uninformed.</p>

My concern is that the thin line between public information and political advertising was well and truly breached in that series of advertisements. I appreciate it is the Minister's first attempt at this type of public information.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_801">It is a type of political advertising we have seen practised by many members of the Government, particularly during the previous Administration. There was a degree of editorialising about what a wonderful Government this is and what wonderful policies it is practising, but we know the reality is different. The Minister's key line in the editorialising of those advertisements was that this was a Government that was  pursuing policies that were working towards an inclusive society. We know that is not the case. In every area of Government policy, health, education, housing and transport, this is a Government whose policies have helped to bring about a less inclusive Ireland. To make such a claim as part of a public information advertisement is fundamentally dishonest. There should be regulations in place on how information should be presented and which would restrict the type of information that can be provided to the public by Government agencies. Information such as that which has been presented dangerously misleads the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">In relation to the national anti-poverty strategy and the Government's commitment to where child poverty and poverty generally should be tackled, we wonder where the commitment to bring payments in line with 30% of the average industrial earning lies. Following the budget, it is in tatters. That benchmark is moving further and further away. It is most peculiar but not surprising that what is seen to be incentives for the "haves" in our society are suddenly turned into disincentives for people who depend on social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">A benchmark is something to which people working in the public sector should aspire and it should be honoured. Achieving a benchmark for those who depend on social welfare will depend on resources. If we had an innovative budget, we would have had a Minister for Social and Family Affairs who would have introduced the concept of index linking social welfare payments. We would have had a Minister who would not have tolerated the idea of anyone on the minimum wage being part of the PAYE system. We would have had a Minister who would have brought forward ideas such as refundable tax credits where those on low pay, to avoid them sliding back into a welfare trap, would be paid the difference of their unused tax portions.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The Bill not only does not stand up in terms of welfare entitlements and tackling the problem of poverty but also sends a clear signal to such people in society that they will be left further behind and that the Government is prepared to think less of them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_805">I support this amendment tabled by my colleagues, Deputy Penrose and Deputy Seán Ryan. As indicated by our spokesperson on social welfare, we will support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">On child benefit, it is unjust and unfair that the first and second child receives a certain rate of payment and third and subsequent children receive a different rate. Why should there be different rates for members of the same family? It is not right, it is unjust and should be changed. It does not comply with our Constitution which states that we should treat all the children of the nation equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">I wish to quote from the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on 5  December 2001. Under the heading, child benefit, he said:</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Last year I announced the Government's intention to invest around £1 billion in increased child benefit over a three year period. As I said at the time our central objective is to support parents in whatever choices they make in looking after their children. Child benefit also offers a most effective means of channelling income support to low-income families in order to tackle child poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">We would agree with that. It certainly reaches poorer families and it is of tremendous assistance to them to have that money spent on their children. Successive reports have shown that the money is spent on children. Perhaps the Minister will tell us at the end of the debate how many people in receipt of child benefit have it as their only source of income in their own name. The rate was 59% to 60% but I imagine it has decreased since. Women mainly draw child benefit and many recipients have it as their only income in their own name.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, went on to say:</p>
          <p eId="para_811">In line with the record increases which I provided last year, I am now announcing the second step in this three year programme. This will see child benefit rates increased by a further £25 per month for the first and second children . . .  and by £30 per month for third and subsequent children. . .</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The Minister said in his Budget Statement last year and the year before that he was setting out a three year programme. He announced year one and year two but there was no year three. There was a severe change from what was promised. Is that misleading or giving false information to the House? The Minister said he was doing it, but when it came to the crunch he withdrew from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">There has been no word from that famous man who gave us history lessons, the former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. He ran away from the Department this year because he knew there would not be good news. He is not a man to give bad news because he does not like it. He liked to give us history lessons. He announced the first and second year of this plan for child benefit and said the third would follow. Will he say that he misled us and apologise to the women of Ireland for that? I would not hold my breath because it may not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">The family income supplement was one of the innovative moves proposed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs during the time of the real coalition Government to assist families on low income and encourage the parents to stay at work. It has grown gradually over the years and is very successful. It forms an important part of the income of many families. Statistics show that the numbers availing of it have fallen short of expectations. There should be a link with the  Revenue Commissioners to see which people earn an income lower than the threshold and to ensure they receive the payment. That might help raise the numbers availing of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">A person in receipt of FIS has a book of payable orders which lasts for 12 months. The advantage is, if the person receives a pay rise, it does not affect the FIS payment. That is a generous gesture on the part of the Minister and her predecessor. However, there is an especially mean downside to it which I hope the Minister will address. If that person's income is reduced to the extent that he or she is entitled to an increased FIS payment, the Department will not change it until the payable orders book is renewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I am aware of two cases of this in my home town and I am sure Deputy Penrose is also familiar with them. In one case, a man was in receipt of disability benefit and his wife worked part-time in a major grocery outlet. They were in receipt of FIS, had two dependent children and lived in a council house. Unfortunately, the family split up when the husband left the family home. The wife had her part-time earnings and FIS payment while still having to pay rent and most of the same expenses prior to her husband's departure. She wondered what she should do and contacted me. I suggested we contact the Department because she was on FIS and it was logical that her entitlement should increase to a much higher payment. However, the Department would not examine her case until it came up for review.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">That is not fair. While it is generous to leave FIS as it is where a person in receipt of it has an increase in his or her wages, it is downright mean not to increase it for someone who has suffered a decrease in income.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The second case concerns a couple where the man receives a very low income. It has been rare recently to come across a person on the minimum wage, and this man is married with three children. The family is trying to buy their own house. They are proud and decent people who keep to themselves when going about their business. The wife was in receipt of disability allowance or benefit. When her case came up for review in April of last year, she was disqualified. This was upheld on appeal the following October. She investigated what she could receive under FIS and was told that it would not come up for review until the following February.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Can the Minister imagine what it is like for those three children at Christmas time? They did not get the Christmas bonus and they are trying to survive on awfully low income. I could use other words to describe it but it would not be parliamentary language. They meet the criteria to qualify for FIS, but because of what I consider extreme meanness they will not get the review. Is that fair? It is not and something should be done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The Minister announced she is capping the rent subsidy. Will the Minister say if all the health boards are enforcing that? As I understand it they are not and the legal regulations required may  not have been put in place to make this work. If that is the case, what went wrong and who slipped up? Is it the same as the drugs refund scheme where we are trying to enforce something without the legal right?</p>
          <p eId="para_821">As I was driving up here today I listened to Pat Kenny on the radio discussing social welfare payments. There was a telephone call from the Department of Social and Family Affairs saying that all payments would kick in from 1 January 2003, including FIS. I understand that people with FIS books of payment will not get increases until the review takes place. I hope I am wrong and that the increases take effect on 1 January. I would like that clarified. Do people get a new FIS book of payment or how does it happen? I might be wrong.</p>

I asked if somebody on long-term social welfare who was elected to the Seanad or Dáil would qualify for the back to work allowance scheme. It was a rather interesting question, to which I thought I knew the answer. I tabled the question last week and I received the usual telephone call from the Department asking if I wanted to withdraw the question and I could receive the answer over the telephone. I asked for the answer and was told that a person is entitled to claim the back to work allowance scheme, but nobody has claimed it yet.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_832">I support amendment No. 1. Prior to the budget, the Government made two promises, one to large financiers to cut corporation tax to 12%, the other to ordinary men and women to increase child benefit in line with the Government's landmark three year programme to increase child benefit. Deputies spoke earlier about choices. When faced with a choice the Government honoured the first promise to big business and the second tells us much about the priorities of the Government. Up to now the Government has claimed the money is not there. The money is there, but the Minister for Finance took a decision not to tax those with money. That is where the choice is. We can argue that the Minister did the wrong thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I represent a constituency with considerable poverty, which is one of the RAPID programme areas. It is frequently in the news for some of the difficulties it has. However, it is also an area with some significant wealth. People with such wealth agree with the concept of a more equal society. There is nobody in this House, including the Taoiseach and his colleagues on the Government benches, who do not want to see a more equal society. This amendment highlights the choice that we are either for people with money or we support people without money. It is clear the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is being asked to carry the can for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Cutting the corporation tax to 12% cost the State about €305 million. The Minister and her Department could do a considerable amount with €305 million and that is just one area of tax. In his wisdom, the Minister for Finance decided to cut it and it is now the lowest in Europe. We have some of the highest <i>per capita</i> income levels in Europe. Of course we have one of the worst levels of infrastructure and some Deputies spoke about how that affects people living in the poverty trap. Deputies also spoke of fuel poverty and the fact that in many houses people do not have heating in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">There were other cuts that also affect the poor. Most people have access to ATM machines and the tax on ATM cards was increased. The increase in value added tax also attacked the poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The Minister told us we will have to wait on the third phase of the child benefit increases to come through. It is clear from the budget and the proposals before us that the poor will have to wait again. The pertinent question is why this is  so. The sad fact is they do not have to wait because the money is available. The claim that it is not is a blatant lie. The Minister, in his wisdom, decided to give it to his friends, among them the bloodstock merchants in Kildare. Certain wealthy elements of society were not taxed when they could have been and the terrible aspect of this is that these revenues could have contributed towards greater equality in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I support the amendment, although I accept it will be lost. However, it is important that this side of the House shows it has a vision of a different Ireland. I believe the majority of citizens share this vision. They want services and expect people to be able to live in dignity. The so-called increases in social welfare payments will result in a loss of dignity and spending power. Inflation will kick in in the new year and people will find it increasingly difficult to manage. Some members of Fianna Fáil have told me the Progressive Democrats's tail is wagging the Fianna Fáil dog.</p>

          <p eId="para_841">I am greatly concerned about the effects these minimal increases in social welfare will have on social welfare recipients. The reverberations of the budget will be felt for many months and years to come. This discredited Government has inflicted on the people a great raft of stealth taxes which reach into practically every sphere of society. It was so brazen and shameless it reached into every child's Christmas stocking and slapped an extra 1% VAT on Bob the Builder, Harry Potter and Spiderman Christmas boxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The Minister has assumed the role of Ireland's serial mugger as he has viciously mugged virtually every sitting duck in sight in the budget, including social welfare recipients who will be severely hit. He also manages the impossible in the tradition of the two headed Janis of Greek mythological fame who could look forward and backward at the same time. While he is certain he is going forward on various fronts, he perpetrates the most aggressive form of taxation on the unfortunate public. The swathe of indirect taxes, fees and charges will apply to both rich and poor across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Minister cheerfully piles inequality upon inequality while giving the wealthy bloodstock owners an exceptionally generous free ride by way of a tax loophole. This is the first time I have heard of a gambling man looking a gift horse in the mouth. Reports in the newspapers suggested the guilty consciences of the stallion owners had led them to indicate they were prepared to pay upwards of €100 million in taxes. This should  have been taken up, yet it was not. A sum of €100 million would do a great deal for the Border area of County Monaghan, giving us a hospital, a swimming pool and a canal stretching from Cavan, through Monaghan to Lough Neagh.

          <p eId="para_845">There are many social welfare recipients in County Monaghan who would be very happy to use the canal in their free time.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The Minister has many victims. First-time house buyer's, for example, are still reeling from the withdrawal of the first-time buyer's grant. They will be hit by the VAT increase which will increase the average price of a house by €2,000. Added to the loss of the first-time buyer's grant, this amounts to €5,800. The value of the additional mortgage interest relief of €350 is thus made virtually worthless.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The Minister continues his pummelling of the unfortunate motorist, revising vehicle registration tax bands of various vehicles of 1901cc to the top rate of 30%. This measure adds 7% to their cost and shows his contempt for the express wishes of the European Commission to end this tax. Social welfare recipients also drive cars. Tractors and the growing number of diesel cars are hit by an additional 3 cent per litre. Before the ink was dry on the Budget Statement an extra 10% to 12% was imposed on motor tax, an increase the Minister had failed to include in the budget as is customary. The decision not to deliver the increase on budget day was cowardly and serves to increase people's general scepticism about Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">This back door tax was the final straw for the plundered motorist who will feel the effects of higher VAT charges in service and repair bills. Two cars are necessary in many households. The measures in the budget will cause many such households to give serious thought to getting rid of one of them. For most people in rural areas, a car is a necessity in the absence of decent public transport infrastructure and increased insurance costs, parking charges, fuel tax, repairs and so forth will have the effect of driving—</p>

As he will appreciate, there is limited time for this debate which must conclude at 10.30 p.m. There are two more amendments which we may not reach. We are dealing with amendment No. 1 which specifically deals with the laying of a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas specifically related to social welfare.

          <p eId="para_865">Unlike the Opposition, I have to work with what I have. The Deputies can continue to harbour illusions about what they might have available to them in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Mention was made of the pre-budget forum, which was a very worthwhile exercise, at which I listened to the proposals of the non-governmental organisations. Perhaps Members would like to hear that the cost of all these demands would amount to €3.5 billion. I, no more than any other  Member of this House, would like to address all the concerns raised by the NGOs which were mentioned. I appreciate NGOs lobby Members no more than they meet me to discuss issues. However, I have always believed in the tenacity of Members elected to the House to listen to the people they represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I am sure Members opposite will go beyond the information they get from NGOs and speak from the heart in regard to what they see as their priorities. They must make a political decision on their priorities and I must make a political decision on the Government's priorities, which I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions. If additional resources were available, I, no more than any other Minister, would be more than forthcoming in trying to target resources at those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">It was mentioned that a lot of money was wasted by my Department on consultancies. Most of the consultants' fees paid by the Department in the past two years have not been on reports but on work done on computer systems for the Department to enable it to provide a better service. Some €1.3 million was spent on reports while €17.9 million was spent on capital work. In the context of available resources this year, I have had to cut most of that expenditure. We are now down to €4 million.</p>

I have done a lot of work in moving towards income adequacy. I agree that in the context of some of the PPF promises, we have not got there yet. However, I intend over a five year period, to move towards the criteria in NAPS, most of which are reflected in the programme for Government. In regard to income adequacy, the Government will continue to pursue a strategy of increasing social welfare payments as resources permit so that people will have an income level to sustain an acceptable standard of living.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">I appreciate a €6 increase may be difficult for those on some of the long-term payments. There is a base line on which we have increased in recent years. Reviews take place on an ongoing basis and they are done in the context of debate in the House, parliamentary questions and the research and support mechanisms, NGOs, CPA, NESC and the NESF. All review income adequacy and how we progress towards the standards set in PPF and post-PPF. There will be ongoing reviews and we may have to re-target but we will have to work in the context of the €530 million or the €10 billion budget at my disposal this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The issue of child benefit was raised. I agree the Minister for Finance said in last year's budget that this was the second of three tranches. He did so in good faith but given the resources available there were two choices. Does one provide over €414 million to provide the third tranche of child benefit which leaves only €100 million or so to provide basic social welfare, or does one take €104 million and provide the increase over the next three years? I made that choice. I would like to have had €400 million plus €600 or €700 million but—</p>

I am sure Deputy McGrath will be delighted to hear that all FIS customers, new and existing, will receive their increases from the beginning of January 2003. All books will be renewed at the beginning of January and will,  therefore, be able to incorporate the increases in the income thresholds announced in the budget effective from 1 January 2003, so we are not as bad as those opposite think.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">It was decided to target the scheme at the long-term unemployed. The Deputy mentioned someone suffering from depression or someone who was ill. Those in receipt of DA, DB and the invalidity and disabled person's pensions are included in the scheme. Ex-prisoners, carers and those in receipt of the one parent family payment, blind person's pension, PRETA and unemployability supplement for one year or more are eligible for the back-to-work scheme. Those in receipt of DB for three years are eligible for the back-to-work scheme while those in receipt of UA for five years are eligible. I had to target those who are less well off and I targeted the most vulnerable groups, those who find it more than difficult to move on and progress from benefits, particularly disabled people who find the back-to-work scheme an excellent resource and the reason many people are employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">I wish to address the issue of rent supplement raised in a heated debate last week. It was brought to my attention by Members opposite, so I took the opportunity to review and discuss it. Following that, I have no plans to annul or modify S.I. No. 527 which I introduced last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The two measures contained in the instrument have been introduced in consolidated legislation. I reiterate the current limits set by health boards were put into regulation and will apply until 31 December 2003. Each health board has different maximum levels. The measures did not introduce capping or new limits. The limits are those determined by the health boards themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The validity of the current limits was extended to 31 December 2003 because data compiled by the CSO showed that rent levels are stable. They have been falling since last April and are now lower than they were one year ago. However,  given this background, there is no justification for landlords increasing the rent they charge. Accordingly, there is no need for health boards to set higher levels of maximum rents for the purpose of SWA rent supplement schemes.</p>

The second measure contained in SI 527 provides that it is explicitly stated in legislation that rent supplement is not payable in cases where the rent is above the relevant limit set by the health board. This is not a new concept, as was stated in the House last week. It is set out in the national administrative procedure manual, compiled by the health boards in 1997. All that is new is it is set out in legislation for the first time.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">The Minister for the Environment and Local Government replied to the Deputy's parliamentary question and he will address his query accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Government has made commitments on social welfare payments and it is my intention to work towards them and to address the issues that have been raised by all Members. We are all in the House to ensure there is social inclusion. It is easy to take a narrow and focused view on one issue but we cannot survive that way. My job, no more than anyone else's, is to ensure we target the most vulnerable in society with the resources available and provide the necessary social supports. As a consequence, I cannot accept the amendment because, in the context of the recommendations by NGOs and many other groups and ongoing departmental reviews, another report on issues that have only been raised in the past few weeks would be futile.</p>

          <p eId="para_917">I thank the Minister for her reply but I will press the amendment because it will not cost the Government a penny. We are asking the Department to prepare reports based on the targets set out in the NAPS and the programme for Government. We want the reports in March or April when the full impact of the inflationary measures introduced in the budget have filtered through the system, not tomorrow or the next day.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I have grave doubts about the rate of inflation. As Deputy Boyle stated, this year's inflation rate was targeted at 3.5% and it is significantly higher than that. We are not as sharp as stockbrokers and it is their business to know what is the rate of inflation. Their forecasts are particularly ominous.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The measures dealing with rents provide a charter for landlords to evict people. The Minister has the best of motives but all a landlord has to do is increase the rent above the maximum limit and say to a tenant that he or she is out unless he or she pays the increased rent. The health board will say it is constrained by the maximum limit and that is as much as it can provide. Therefore, the tenant is out. The Government should tackle the private rented sector in the appropriate way, which is through legislation. This method controls private rents through the SWA scheme and it will not work.</p>

          <p eId="para_926">2.–The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test for carer's allowance and introd ucing a top-up carer's payment for those in receipt of another social welfare payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">This amendment refers to the carer's allowance. The implementation of this amendment would not incur any additional cost to the Exchequer. It would help give carers a place in society. For too long they have been the forgotten group in the Irish health system, often providing constant care 24 hours a day for seven days a week and often at the expense of their own health. Carers have been taken for granted by the State and society and they often carry a huge burden while at the same time relieving the State of the obligation of caring. The cost of paying for a member of the family to stay in a long-term nursing home is very high compared with the cost of a carer in the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">The Labour Party recommends the abolition of the means test for carer's allowance. All Members on both sides of the House are in favour of improving the quality of life of carers and giving them opportunities outside the caring environment. We wish to improve the level of support for community care. Even though commitments have been made on all sides of the House they have not been carried through. We want to plan for the future and examine the cost of providing for carers. Do we know how many carers there are and how many people are being cared for? One group says that there are 100,000 carers and another says there are 150,000 or 200,000. A national carers' register should be established so that carers' needs can be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">We do not have enough time now to examine this issue in a meaningful way. All of us should pay more than lip service and put in place a mechanism which would show the implications of the abolition of the carer's means test and the introduction of a top-up carer's payment for  those in receipt of other social welfare payments. The Minister has expressed her support for carers and I want to see that concern put to the test in her support of this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_930">There are 120,000 carers in the country. A person looking after a sick person in the home works 168 hours a week. If they get paid from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, it will be 75 cent an hour. Is that fair? A child going to the shop would throw that back at you. This is a great national scandal. We are all in public life. Carers come to my clinic and I see in their faces and hands the effort they are making and the money they are saving this State. The time has come for them to be given proper recognition. Some 100,000 carers are getting nothing from the State. It is a terrible situation where a person wishing to care at home for a husband or wife cannot be given a carer's allowance if they are over the means because they have a modest job. It is wrong and it is time we did something for them. The State must recognise their valuable work. It costs €1,200 per week to keep someone in a public nursing home. It would be lovely to give the carer at home €50, €60 or €70 a week as recognition for the work they do. That is not too much to ask and it is time it was done. These people save the State a fortune.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">As regards the subvention, the time has come to consider not taking a person's home into account. That is the greatest national scandal and it is wrong. When an old person leaves home, his or her greatest wish is to come back again.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_446">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_939">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter and thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply. I, with Deputies Connolly and Ó Caoláin and Senator O'Brien, yesterday visited the part of County Monaghan that is not included in the severely handicapped scheme. I advise anybody else who has time to pay a visit and see the injustice that has been done to that area that it would be time well spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">It is no exaggeration to say that for 30 years, many small farmers in this area have lost thousands of pounds. The only reason that could be offered in response to my question on 23 October was that commission officials expressed concerns that any proposal to change the classification of a certain area or areas could open up the prospect of a wider examination. It is extremely unfair that the people of the parishes of Aghabog, Corcaghan and the surrounding areas – 16% of the total area of County Monaghan – should be left out of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">A survey was carried out way back in 1989-90 into income and other factors in the area. It is clear that most of the area left out qualified under the criteria in place at that time. In the townland of Ardaghey Kill, the State owns 123 acres and Lord Rossmore owns 17. There were two surveys, according to the records, but we cannot find out how the two properties could be surveyed. I did not think it was possible to survey a tree. In Cornaglare, the State owns 43 acres, a lake occupies 22 acres and five farmers own ten to 27 acres each. Only two were surveyed. Drumuck consists of 149 acres, with nine famers owning nine to 24 acres. Only one was surveyed. Lislynchan comprises 144 acres, with six farmers owning three to 26 acres. One was surveyed. Tonagh comprises 75 acres, with six farmers owning three to 25 acres. Two were surveyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">This is an indication of the small farm structures of these areas, yet they are classified as having risen above the farm income survey criteria of the time. Most interesting of all is Drumlinney part A, comprising 230 acres, with ten farms and 29 acres devoted to forestry. No survey was done  here, yet this townland is being used by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and Department officials to claim that it is blocking others by forming a barrier between existing townlands. Drumlinney part B comprises 80 acres owned by six farmers. None of them was surveyed either. When we visited the area the other day it was clear that one of the farmers, who keeps hens in pens, had to carry out drainage work so the land could carry hens, let alone cattle.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">There are 321 acres in Liscumiskey, 77 of which are forestry. There are 16 farmers of whom two were surveyed. Part of the lands I owned were in Mullagreenan and Drumgarley before I moved to where I live now. The farmers there are good dairy farmers but they had to have their cows housed throughout this summer. They are not allowed into the scheme either.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">I will conclude by mentioning a farm at Freemount, Cootehill. The land surrounding the farm, owned by one family, is classified as severely handicapped but this farm was left out. Half the farm floods on a regular basis. An injustice is being done to this group of farmers. Today they get area aid but for a year they received nothing. The land is difficult and the farms are small. The Department officials have admitted that most of the ground in that area qualifies. When the last tranche was designated the best land was included. The south of the county is good land and it is designated severely handicapped. The land in the north of the county, around Smithborough and Glaslough, is also good land and is severely handicapped.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">How can the Minister not bring this matter to Brussels? It is vital that this be done immediately and that justice be done where a major injustice has existed over the last 30 years. I beg the Minister, at this late stage, to bring this issue to Brussels and have the land reclassified. It was done before and there is no reason it cannot be done again.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_946">When the disadvantaged areas appeals panel was commencing its examination of areas for reclassification in 1992 it was decided, following agreement with the farming organisations, that the panel would base its recommendations on data gathered in the 1989 survey. This data had been used in the previous fourth review to select areas for reclassification, based on an income criterion of less than 40% of national average income and at least 40% of the working population being engaged in agriculture. It was agreed that if the income limit was raised to 60% and the working population limit was disregarded, the data would allow selection of a significant number of additional areas. A further condition was that the land must be rated at four or less on a quality scale of 0 – 9 and also that selected areas must adjoin existing more severely handicapped areas. The Deputy will agree that this has been standard practice when reclassification occurred in any part of Europe. The land has to be linked to an existing area.</p>

          <p eId="para_952">Following a further re-check, some additional areas were added in 1998 which were approved by the European Commission in February 1999. These additional areas brought the total more severely handicapped area of County Monaghan to 85%. The remaining 15% of County Monaghan cannot be reclassified as more severely handicapped on the basis of the data contained in the 1989 survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Officials from my Department met informally with European Commission officials in May 2002 and raised the question of reclassifying areas currently classified as less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped. It would not be possible or acceptable to the European Commission to use other criteria, such as proximity to the Border, as a means of re-classification. If consideration were to be given to further reclassification, it is unlikely that this could be confined to a part of the country to the exclusion of other areas. A more widespread survey could open up the possibility of the current classification of disadvantaged areas being re-opened.</p>

          <p eId="para_955">Weather conditions during the summer led to difficulties for farmers in many parts of the country and that is the reason the Minister, Deputy Walsh, arranged for the highest ever payout of compensatory allowance and premia in mid-October last. In so far as County Monaghan is concerned, the number of farmers benefiting from the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme has increased from about 3,500 to 4,000 in 2001 due to the changeover to an area based payment system. Overall, about 3,100 farmers in County Monaghan gained an average of €971 annually under these new arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_957">The Government is committed, in the programme for Government, to examine, in conjunction with the Commission, the possibility of extending the disadvantaged areas classifi cation to the entire BMW region. While this commitment relates to an extension of disadvantaged areas rather than to re-classification of existing disadvantaged areas, both issues can be formally raised with the European Commission in the context of a review of the CAP rural development plan in 2003. The Government is concerned to ensure, however, that a re-opening of the debate would not lead to a wider review of disadvantaged areas generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">I listened with great interest to the case made by the Deputy. I am pleased that he and his Oireachtas colleagues have visited this area of County Monaghan. We will take note of what has been said in this debate and continue to negotiate during 2003. Let us hope there will be a positive conclusion in the interests of the entire country.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_459">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_960">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Chomhairle, as an seans a thabhairt dom an ceist seo a ardú. I recently asked the Minister for Health and Children about the plans for bio-preparedness in this State. He referred me to the report, "Biological Threats: A Health Response for Ireland", which was produced by the expert committee on contingency planning for biological threats. It was published last May.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The report recommends the designation of key hospitals as centres for the reception of patients with smallpox and quarantine units for those who have been exposed to smallpox. In keeping with best practice and in the event of an outbreak of a contagious disease, the emphasis is on containment or preventing the epidemic from spreading. Patients diagnosed with a disease such as smallpox should be isolated in a negative pressure isolation room in a designated unit. The expert committee's report also states that in cases of suspected anthrax, plague or tularaemia, all human samples will be analysed in the public health laboratory at Cherry Orchard Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Cherry Orchard Hospital opened in the 1950s, when the Dublin Fever Hospital on Cork Street transferred its services to Ballyfermot. Its admissions policy obliges it to admit all cases of schedule infectious diseases. It has four wards available for the treatment of communicable diseases. Three of these are in regular use and one is available to meet any emergency situation. The facilities provided by Cherry Orchard Hospital are vital in the event of a State-wide outbreak of an infectious disease or if the country was struck, either deliberately or accidentally, by chemical or biological weapons.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">I was recently advised that Cherry Orchard Hospital might be downgraded from an acute hospital to a step down facility from 1 January 2003. The Minister for Health and Children must clarify the position of the Government in relation to the current and future status of the hospital. As the only hospital specifically equipped to deal with infectious diseases in the State, it would be  extremely shortsighted if the isolated units in the hospital were closed and the hospital downgraded. If downgrading is to proceed, will the Minister explain both the reasons for it and the ramifications? Will he provide funding to other facilities so they will be prepared and fitted out with the equipment they would be required to have on standby in case of emergency?</p>
          <p eId="para_964">The reality of closing down hospital units and reducing service without preparing contingencies has become only too clear recently with the tragic death of baby Bronagh Livingstone in Monaghan. It is not good enough that the staff at the hospital and the general public still do not know what is planned for Cherry Orchard Hospital from 1 January next. In light of the above and in view of the recent decision by the IMO to direct public health doctors and medical professionals not to participate in a meeting arranged by a sub-group dealing with the threat of bio-terrorism, will the contingency plans for a bio-terrorism attack not fall into disarray? I call on the Minister to halt any plans to downgrade Cherry Orchard Hospital. Instead, he should have the hospital upgraded in line with the assessment of the Irish Medical Council recommendations.</p>

        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_460">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_965">I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to Cherry Orchard Hospital, Ballyfermot and to respond positively to a number of issues he raised on the Adjournment debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Cherry Orchard Hospital, Ballyfermot, is managed by the South Western Area Health Board. I assure the House that the South Western Area Health Board has no plans to downgrade the hospital. Indeed, the board is proposing to extend the services provided on the campus and has plans for the hospital to play a major part in the development of services in the eastern region, which I am sure Deputy Ó Snodaigh will welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">At one stage Cherry Orchard had 231 beds for infectious diseases and had become by custom and practice a hospital where people with infectious diseases were accommodated. However, over the past 15 years the majority of its work has been in other patient services. Two wards have continued to be made available for persons with infectious diseases.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">In recent years it has become the practice to refer and treat patients with infectious disease in acute general hospitals. It is now generally agreed by the medical profession, including the Medical Council, that an acute general hospital is the appropriate setting for the delivery of this service. Because of this the number of patients with acute infectious diseases admitted to Cherry Orchard has significantly reduced. The majority of these admissions have been from the eastern region.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">The following services are currently provided from the Cherry Orchard campus, primary care  services, community services, 66 residential beds for older persons, 30 in-patient psychiatric beds, 17 in-patient detoxification beds, 52 beds for paediatric and adult infectious diseases and 24 beds for young disabled adults. The complex also accommodates a public health laboratory for a number of health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">While there are 52 beds for persons with infectious diseases in Cherry Orchard the average daily admission of patients with infectious diseases to these wards is three with the average length of stay ranging from one to five days.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Cherry Orchard does not have a range of back-up services and staffing to manage patients with acute illnesses. These are more appropriately treated in acute general hospitals where a range of specialist expertise and facilities are present.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">In light of the small number of referrals and admissions of acute infectious diseases to the hospital, and in view of the general agreement that it is most appropriate to treat these patients in acute general hospitals, the South Western Area Health Board is in the process of arranging for all cases of acute infectious diseases to be managed in acute general hospitals. Discussions to put this arrangement in place are in train. Accordingly, it has been determined that patients with acute infectious diseases will no longer be treated in Cherry Orchard Hospital from 1 January 2003. The Department is advised that there is at present only one child and seven adult in-patients in the infectious diseases section of the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">In the event of a terrorist attack with chemical or biological weapons or a national outbreak of infectious diseases, arrangements will be in place as part of the emergency planning function to co-ordinate acute hospital and all other health services throughout the country. This will involve a major partnership project in which all health facilities, including Cherry Orchard, may have a role.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Regional Airports.</heading>
        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_461">
          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_974">There are five cities in this State, three of which have State-run airports, Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Galway, like Waterford, has a regional airport but it has a public service obligation route to Dublin with an anticipated €112 subvention for each return journey. The major difference between the airports in the cities of Galway and Waterford is this subvention, but the inequity does not stop there.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">There are six regional airports in total, Waterford, Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Donegal. All except Waterford have a public service obligation route to Dublin. There is also a public service obligation route from Derry to Dublin. Passengers on a return trip on the Kerry-Dublin route are subvented by an anticipated €114. Passengers from Knock to Dublin are subvented by an anticipated €560 per return journey. The anticipated subventions on a return journey from Sligo and  Donegal are €174 and €350, respectively. The Dublin-Derry return trip subvention is of the order of €236.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">Access transport remains a major problem for Waterford. The southern section of the upgraded N9-N10, Kilcullen-Waterford road is causing major concern as regards when and if construction will commence. This has to be viewed in conjunction with Waterford losing its link with the North Wall rail freight hub in early January 2003, which will effectively close down the rail links from Waterford port. On the one hand, this will put considerable extra freight on a very inadequate road system while on the other it will greatly restrict the port of Waterford's ability to generate new business. The proposed new river crossing at Waterford is to be hard tolled, while heavy vehicles using the Dublin port tunnel will not be tolled.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Waterford is the only one of the five major cities not to have a university. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have refused to give the excellent Waterford Institute of Technology a stand-alone status similar to the Dublin Institute of Technology so that it can more rapidly achieve university status. Recent cutbacks further exacerbate this situation. Cork, Limerick and Galway all have both universities and institutes of technology. There are also serious concerns regarding the rollout of broadband for Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">EuroCeltic Airways will be withdrawing its services from Waterford with effect from 26 January 2003. Yesterday, eight days before Christmas, protective notice was issued to the 22 staff at the South Eastern Regional Airport in Waterford. The helicopter search and rescue service operated at the airport on behalf of the Irish coastguard is now threatened because of the financial situation. The airport board is making every effort to keep the airport open but it is extremely hard to be optimistic. It received a marketing grant of €410,000 this year. The minimum running costs will be of the order of €800,000 not just to stay open but to provide the required level of manpower and services. Nicholas Fewer, the chairman of the airport company, pointed out that the five other regional airports received the vast bulk of the €29 million in subsidies paid out this year. He also stated that neither the South East Regional Airport nor EuroCeltic Airways can continue to provide essential services from Waterford while running up substantial losses. I regret that the Minister for Transport is not here for this debate.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_463">
          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_980">I welcome the fact that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is here. The recent introduction of the penalty points system has been a success. I fully support it, but one of its consequences has been to slow down traffic, making the road journey time between Waterford and Dublin considerably  longer. This gives the Minister an excellent opportunity to go back to the EU to seek sanction for a public service obligation air route between Waterford and Dublin. In the meantime it is vital to provide the funding to keep the airport open, to protect the 22 jobs and retain the Irish coastguard helicopter search and rescue service at the airport. EuroCeltic will achieve 77% of its target this year on its Waterford-Luton route. The route will have a total of 31,000 passengers by the end of the year while 41,000 passengers would allow it to break even. Waterford and the South Eastern Regional Airport are being discriminated against, both in terms of the other four cities and the other five regional airports. I demand that the Minister for Transport urgently intervenes to prevent a major disaster not just for Waterford but for the south east region.</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_981">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as ucht na ceiste seo a ardú. Mar Aire a bhfuil cúram fhorbartha tuaithe air, tá áthas orm go bhfuil an deis seo agam an cheist a fhreagairt.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Waterford Airport, trading as South East Regional Airport, is a community airport operated by a private company which includes representatives from the local authorities in the south east on the board. The airport commenced operations in 1985. It was given an infrastructure development grant of €1.5 million in the late 1980s and a further €476,000 in 1998 for a runway overlay extension. Between 1993 and 2001, the airport also received over €1.2 million in Exchequer support for promotion and marketing.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Passenger traffic in 2001 was only 15,500 compared to a high of around 50,000 in 1990. A small UK carrier, EuroCeltic, commenced services between Waterford and Luton in 2001. EuroCeltic recently decided to terminate this service from 26 January 2003. The company has stated that the service needed to attract around 40,000 passengers per year to break even, but will only fill approximately 31,000 seats this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">It is understood from the airport company that neither the local authorities in the south east nor private sector interests locally are prepared to invest any further funds in the airport. The Waterford Airport authorities have been making vigorous efforts to reduce the airport deficit going forward. However, bridging the gap remaining between revenue and costs, after account is taken of Exchequer support, has been proving very difficult and this problem, coupled with the pending loss of the airport's only scheduled air link to Luton, operated by EuroCeltic Airways, has prompted the Waterford board to issue protective notice this week to the 22 staff employed at the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">Several years ago the EU Commission objected to a PSO air link between Waterford and Dublin because it considered other transport modes to be adequate. Partly in recognition of the fact that the airport did not have a PSO service, the grant  from the Department of Transport for marketing, promotion and security was substantially increased from €250,000 in 2001 to €410,000 in 2002 representing an increase of 64%.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">Waterford Airport has a runway capable of handling mainly turboprop aircraft and general/corporate aircraft movements. Limited air services using turboprop aircraft of the kind available from Waterford are not attractive to modern day air travellers. The experience of Waterford with market-led air services to the UK has been irregular and not sustained, even during the recent years of record economic growth. Cork Airport, with its growing range of services, is only a two hour drive away on improving roads and is an increasingly formidable competitor. Airports are now facing increased costs in the area of security, safety and general compliance with higher standards. In this scenario, Waterford Airport faces very grave difficulties looking forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">The financial outlook as provided recently by the airport company shows that the airport cannot be sustained by the levels of assistance which could be reasonably expected from the Exchequer. After the enhanced offer of Exchequer marketing support is taken into account, the continued operation of the airport rests on its ability to attract and retain a range of attractively priced air services in the light of the available catchment area and on the willingness of people in the airport catchment area to support such air services by using them.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">The Minister for Transport and his officials remain in close contact with the airport authorities at Waterford and a further meeting will take place this Thursday, 19 December. It is hoped that the efforts of the airport board to put together a sustainable business plan will bear fruit despite the difficulties they face.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - CLÁR Programme.</heading>
        <speech by="#CeciliaKeaveney" eId="spk_465">
          <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_989">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this issue which is of extreme importance to my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, is taking this matter tonight which concerns the expansion of the CLÁR programme, particularly in areas in my own constituency of Donegal North East. There are areas in Fanad and, more particularly, in Inishowen which can and should be included in the programme. That will be the crux of my argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The manager of a Leader programme wrote to the Minister recently. The letter stated: "We believe that Inishowen's exclusion is a statistical anomaly . . . that can be overcome". That anomaly must be overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">They say flattery gets one nowhere but it must be used in this case because the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, introduced the CLÁR programme, which has been excellent. I am sure the Minister will agree that it has been seen to be an excellent programme and that is the reason people like me are asking the Minister to extend CLÁR. CLÁR has  proven itself throughout the country but the peninsula of Inishowen has lost out on what has been a very good programme to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">I ask the Minister to expand the CLÁR programme in our area. We are jealous of the areas which benefit from CLÁR. We read about the success stories that have come about as a result of the money provided under it. We look at our own difficulties in terms of getting funding for group water and sewerage schemes, etc. We need that funding and I ask the Minister to expand CLÁR into our area.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Inishowen qualifies not only in terms of the criteria but also the general reason CLÁR was set up in the first place. If CLÁR is not extended to my areas, as Chairman of the Oireachtas committee on rural development I will press the Minister in the future on what he will do for areas such as Inishowen which is at a comparative disadvantage in terms of attracting business and infrastructure when compared to urban centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">CLÁR's roots are in the wish to target areas of particular disadvantage in the rural community, as outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. With a score of 9.7 in the 1999 Hasse Report, Inishowen was ranked as the most disadvantaged area in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">The decision taken on the basis of population statistics in relation to the CLÁR programme leads me to ask if many areas lost out because people who had holiday homes were included in the census. Was population decline the best guide to use in that regard? The fact that parts of the Inishowen peninsula are 90 miles from the two mile corridor that connects Donegal to the rest of the Republic should have shown that rural disadvantage exists. In regard to other examples from the Hasse report, the peninsula of Cooley was included but did we not have a strong argument in our constituency post-Fruit of the Loom with the enormous number of job losses and the social implications arising from that? People are travelling to and from Dublin on a weekly basis to engage in the only employment they could obtain, which puts extreme stress on family life.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">Taking population into account, information from the new census indicates that areas near the large urban centre of Derry have attracted population increases but many other rural areas are still struggling, particularly northern Inishowen, and they need a CLÁR type programme. Leader has drawn up supporting maps which graphically outline the problem. Areas such as Ard Malin, Dunaff and Tremone had a population divergence of 53%, 54% and 63% from 1926 to 2002. On the larger scale, there is a 43% population decrease in those years with a population of 3,116 or a population decrease of 37% with a population of 8,437. These are significant figures which would support the other issues to which I have already alluded. I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on the concept that a rural popu lation of over 10,000 which showed a decrease in population between 1996 and 2002 could be included in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">CLÁR has been a great invention of the Minister. I congratulate him and ask him to extend it to the areas in my constituency which are at the very core of the purpose of the initiative. I assure him he will be giving a lifeline to a community which badly needs it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_466">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_999">In picking population decline I was conscious of a need to pick something to which people could relate. The original proposal had been to use the Hasse indexes but my contention is that it throws up semi-urban areas. In rural areas that experience large population decreases, the people migrate to the cities for houses and jobs when they are not available locally. Furthermore, I am convinced that rural depopulation has been the biggest scourge of rural Ireland, just as overgrowth has been the biggest scourge of our cities. It was on this basis that I decided to pick very simple criteria, with the exception of the Cooley peninsula, for picking CLÁR areas. It was also with this in mind that we fixed on a population decrease of 50%. In the last two years the question of population decrease has become one of major national focus and is now a major political issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">As the Deputy is aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment for annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. The National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis at NUI Maynooth has recently completed its analysis of the 2002 population census and my Department has examined the results in the context of the review of the areas in the CLÁR programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Today, the Government approved the proposed changes to the CLÁR areas and arrangements are being made to publish the maps and data as soon as they are received from NUI Maynooth. All old CLÁR areas have been retained and 189 new DEDs are being added bringing the population in CLÁR areas from 287,270 to 361,901. One new county is included while extra DEDs are being added in 13 counties, including County Donegal. To extend CLÁR any further would be too spread a finite sum of money over such a large area that it would not have any effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">I am thankful to the Deputy for the kind words she used in describing the CLÁR programme. It is modelled on what I, and every Deputy, hears on the ground as the daily requirements of people living in isolated areas of our countryside. I hope that in the next five years it will begin to redress the imbalance in development between the growing and declining areas of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The Dáil adjourned at 11.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 December 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_1010">Irish overseas development assistance is likely to be in the region of €450 million next year, compared to some €420 million in 2002. This increased allocation will be the highest ever in the history of the programme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_63">I am aware that concerns have been expressed regarding a possible reduction in support for the emergency humanitarian subhead under the Ireland Aid budget. I assure the Deputies that no such cuts in this subhead are planned for next year. A reduced allocation to the emergency humanitarian subhead was included in the Abridged Ireland Aid Estimates published in November last. However, on 20 November, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, made clear in the Dáil that emergency humanitarian assistance is a key component of the Ireland Aid pro gramme, particularly given the current needs in the famine-affected countries in Africa and the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, and that he would be taking steps to ensure that resources at least of the order of those made available in 2002 will be provided again in 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">Ireland Aid has mounted a rapid and significant response to the growing food security crisis in the Horn of Africa. The greatest need will be in Ethiopia, where five million people currently require food assistance, but this figure could rise to 14 million people by May 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">In response to the worsening situation, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, held urgent discussions on 18 November with leading Irish non-governmental organisations, NGOs. Following the meeting, he announced a special €2 million food assistance package for the people of Ethiopia. This brings the Government's total spending on emergency and humanitarian relief for the Horn of Africa region to over €7 million to date this year. A further €9 million has been delivered to alleviate the humanitarian situation in the southern African region since its food crisis began in 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">Two weeks ago, the Minister of State sent an Ireland Aid mission to Ethiopia to co-ordinate the Government's emergency assistance with other donors, the United Nations and the NGO community. The Minister of State will himself travel to Ethiopia in January to assess the impact that famine, drought and HIV and AIDS are having on the people of the region. During the visit he will have an opportunity to view the life-saving work being carried out by Irish NGOs, UN agencies, other international organisations and the Ethiopian authorities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">In addition to the Government's emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is delivering long-term development support to Ethiopia. In 2003 it is estimated that this support will exceed €27 million, making Ireland one of the largest donors in Ethiopia.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">Ireland's financial support has been complemented by ongoing political action. The Government has been working closely with its partners in the European Union and United Nations to develop strategies on how immediate food needs in Africa can best be addressed at both national and regional levels. The Minister of State raised the crisis in discussions he had with the Deputy Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme, who visited Dublin a little over a week ago, and with World Bank and UN agency representatives during a recent visit to Washington and New York. He had already met EU Commissioner Poul Nielson in Brussels last July for discussions on EU action in response to the food crises in Africa.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">We will continue to follow closely the unfolding situation in the Horn of Africa. The Government stands prepared to deliver further assistance from the Ireland Aid programme in the new year. We will continue to work closely with Irish and international NGOs and with our donor  partners in the EU and UN to ensure maximum co-ordination in the international response to this crisis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1012">Since the establishment of the State, Ireland has been committed to upholding a multilateral approach to international relations, based upon the equality of states and the rule of law. This commitment has been expressed through our membership of, and active participation in, international organisations such as the United Nations. Membership of these organisations has enabled us to promote the interests, values and objectives which we have traditionally held to be important. These values include respect for universal human rights, democracy and a rule-based international system, collective approaches to security and conflict prevention and sustainable development of the least developed countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">In pursuance of our foreign policy objectives, we remain committed to the primacy of the UN's role in promoting constructive international relations. Our membership of the UN and other international organisations, including the OSCE, Council of Europe and WTO, affords us the opportunity to advance views on equal terms with other countries on issues such as the peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights and trade regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">Our current membership of the UN Security Council, which comes to a close at the end of the year, has enabled us to demonstrate the contribution which a small country can make. Our active commitment to the UN will continue to be demonstrated from January 2003 through, <i>inter alia,</i> membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights, ECOSOC and the co-ordination board of UNAIDS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The pursuit of foreign policy objectives in international organisations has also been enhanced by our membership of the EU, which has provided a framework for co-operation and co-ordination with our EU partners across a broad range of issues.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_70">Ireland has permanent missions to the United Nations in New York and Geneva, to the OSCE in Vienna and to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. Our embassy in Vienna is accredited to the UN agencies and other international organisations based in Vienna and our embassy in Paris is accredited to the OECD. These offices enable the Government to follow developments in the respective international organisations and to pursue our interests and objectives in them. As and when necessary, I and my colleagues in Govern ment travel to meetings of international organisations to present the Government's position on issues of particular interest to Ireland. The work of various international organisations is also followed through EU working groups in Brussels, in which Irish officials actively participate, and where positions are co-ordinated across a range of issues.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1017">The European Union attaches the highest degree of importance to its relations with both the United States and Canada. The countries of the EU, the United States and Canada share the same heritage based on democratic principles and respect for human rights. In addition, the economies of the two regions enjoy a high degree of interdependence and account for almost half of the world's economic activity. Against that background it is in the interests of the EU, the US and Canada to work together to resolve differences where they may exist, whether in the political or  economic spheres, and to promote their common goals and interests in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">There is a formal framework for meetings between representatives of the EU and the US and Canadian authorities. A summit level meeting takes place once a year with the US while meetings at ministerial level take place in the intervening period. The most recent summit, attended by President Bush, was held in Washington on 2 May 2002. The next EU-US meeting at ministerial level will be in Washington on 18 December 2002. Summit meetings with Canada are held every six months and the next will be in Ottawa on Thursday, 19 December 2002. In both cases, international issues of importance in the political and economic fields are considered, as are any transatlantic bilateral issues which are current.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">In the economic area, the first priority is to work with both the US and Canada towards a balanced outcome to the latest round of multilateral trade negotiations, known as the Doha Development Agenda. This round is now entering a crucial phase and is due to conclude at the beginning of 2005. Another major priority is to deepen the bilateral economic relationship between the EU and the US, including through tackling obstacles to trade. The EU-Canada Summit on Thursday is expected to launch a review of the bilateral trade relationship with a view to developing this close relationship even further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">In the broader political area, the aim is to further develop co-operation with the United States and Canada on a range of issues. Discussions at the ministerial meeting in Washington will focus on the situation in Afghanistan, Iraq and North Korea, and on co-operation in the fight against terrorism. There will also be a discussion on issues in relation to Africa, including conflict, famine and development co-operation. The EU and the US also work closely together as members of the Quartet in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Middle East peace process. The EU-Canada summit will include discussions on the strengthening of multilateral approaches to shared problems, co-operation in the fight against terrorism, the Middle East, Iraq and North Korea.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">Membership of the Security Council in 2001 and 2002 has afforded an extraordinary opportunity to serve the international community and to promote our values and objectives in the pursuit of international peace and security and human rights for all.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_85">Ireland came to the Security Council two years ago as a strong and passionate supporter of multi lateralism. As I have previously told the House, our approach to issues on the Security Council agenda has been based on our traditional commitment to peacekeeping, disarmament, human rights and development co-operation. We have sought to ensure that the human rights of individuals and the humanitarian needs of populations remain central to discussions at the Council, and have stressed at all times the need to address the root causes of conflict and to respect the principles of international law.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">Our Presidency of the Council in October 2001 was highly successful. We sought at all times to provide an effective and efficient chairmanship, progressing the issues on the agenda at that time. Our Presidency coincided with the aftermath of the events of 11 September. We were firm in protecting the role and prerogatives of the Security Council following US and UK military action in Afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">It is a matter of fundamental importance for us that the Security Council's primary responsibility has been asserted in the engagement of the international community with Iraq. This arose not simply from a desire to make one last effort to seek Iraq's disarmament through peaceful means, but also from the need to maintain international legitimacy and the desire to act in accordance with international law.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">The Middle East conflict represents a profound and real threat to world peace. Ireland has taken a clear and emphatic position on Middle East issues in the Security Council. While it is a matter of regret that more has not been achieved during this period, I believe that we have contributed to a strengthening of the UN's role in efforts to resolve this conflict.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">African issues have been a consistent priority for the Security Council during Ireland's period of membership. Significant progress has been made towards resolving the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone and Ethiopia-Eritrea, and the challenge now is to consolidate that progress and avoid a slide back into war. Ireland took a particularly firm position on the situation in western Sahara, where we have refused to support proposals which could have called into question the right of the Saharawi people to self-determination.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">On counter-terrorism, Ireland has played an active role in the construction of a framework of legislative and executive actions against terrorism, while emphasising that human rights must be fully respected in this regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">Our overall approach has, in my view, enabled Ireland to make a very positive and substantive contribution to the work of the Council. Members of the current and previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will confirm that our efforts have been welcomed and respected by other member states, in and beyond the Council, and by the NGO community. Our close involvement with all the issues and conflicts on the Security Council agenda confirms the positive role that Ireland can and does play both at the  United Nations and in other international organisations.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1028">I visited New York and Washington from 22 to 27 November last. A delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, led by its Chairman, Deputy Woods, visited New York at the same time. The visit took place as Ireland's term on the UN Security Council comes to an end and provided the opportunity to again highlight the importance Ireland attaches to the UN and, in particular, the Security Council. The visit also provided the members of the incoming Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs with a useful opportunity to see at first hand the work of Ireland at the UN.</p>

At those meetings, we discussed a range of current international issues, including Iraq, the Middle East peace process, Afghanistan and UN peacekeeping. I also met with a number of permanent representatives of UN member states and with a group of representatives of international NGOs. It was gratifying throughout these contacts to hear the repeated praise for the role which Ireland has played at the Security Council, particularly in relation to human rights and humanitarian issues.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_92">On 25 November, I was invited to address the National Committee on American Foreign Policy on the subject of "Peace and Security: Ireland  and the UN". In my speech, I focused on a number of key issues: our membership of the UN Security Council and our commitment to multilateralism; the importance of a strong UN which can respond to the evolving challenges of the globalised world, where the only way to resolve disputes is through regional co-operation allied to strong international will; the opportunity for the United States to pursue a leadership role through the United Nations; our position on Iraq and on Security Council Resolution 1441, on ending the impasse in the Middle East, on building peace in Afghanistan, on the challenges facing Africa and on the threat of terrorism; and the Northern Ireland peace process.</summary>

This was a very constructive meeting, in the course of which we exchanged detailed views on a range of international issues, including Iraq and Security Council Resolution 1441, the Middle East, Cyprus and Turkey. I also briefed the Secretary of State on developments in the Northern Ireland peace process and thanked him for the continued interest and involvement of the US Administration.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">My visit to New York last month took place at a very important time for the United Nations, as the effectiveness of multilateralism is put to the test.

          <p eId="para_1033">In view of the legitimate and understandable security concerns of the countries involved, it is not the Government's policy to provide details of requests for overflight and landing permission supplied by individual countries. In the case of routine landings, confirmation is required that the aircraft do not carry arms, ammunition or explosives and do not form part of a military exercise or operation. In submitting requests for routine landings, all countries are expected to comply with these stipulations. In this context, no routine landing applications have been refused.</p>

          <p eId="para_1035">Landing and overflights facilities were also offered to foreign military aircraft during the UN-mandated operation in the Persian Gulf in 1991. Our files do not, however, indicate that any requests to waive the usual stipulations were submitted at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1044">I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 46, 80, 91, 92, 97, 157 and 161 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">As Deputies will be aware, a highly important debate about the future of Europe is currently under way at the European Convention on the Future of Europe. It is a debate in which the Government is a fully active participant.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_95">In the first phase of its work, roughly from February until the summer, the convention broadly examined the challenges facing Europe, in particular those issues identified in the Laeken Declaration under which it was established. A second phase, from the summer until now, saw working groups examine specific areas in close detail with a view to making recommendations. Some of these groups covered broad policy areas, including external actions, freedom, security and justice and economic governance. Others addressed highly technical questions including legal personality, complementary competencies and the simplification of instruments and procedures. As ten  of the 11 working groups have finished their work, this phase is now drawing to a close. The newly constituted Working Group on Social Europe, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is a member, is to report by the end of January.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">During the third phase of the convention's work, from the new year until the early summer when it is expected to report, the Presidium will bring forward detailed texts for discussion. These will reflect the recommendations of the working groups and the views expressed in plenary session. There will also be debate on institutional questions. Taken together, this work will form the basis of the convention's final report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">We have already received from the Presidium its thoughts on what the overall shape of the convention's outcome should be. At the end of October, it brought forward a skeleton draft treaty, which was essentially a list of headings. This proposed a single treaty – as opposed to the current multiplicity of texts – reflecting a single legal personality. It proposed a structure under which broad principles, aims and objectives of the Union would be set out in a first part, with detail on the operation of the various policy areas in a separate second part. As I said at the time, while much detail remains to be added, this is a sensible approach which should make the treaties more legible and accessible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">We have also recently seen papers published by the Commission and by the Benelux countries – Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg – setting out their thinking on institutional matters. I agree with the Commission's contention that we need to strengthen all of the institutions, preserving the existing balances between them, while preparing them for the challenges ahead. I found the Commission's proposals on some of the institutional questions particularly interesting and creative. The Benelux paper is also of great interest and I expect that we will be in a position to support many of the proposals it makes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">While, under the treaties, it is for the Intergovernmental Conference to take final decisions, there can be little doubt that the outcome of the convention's work will be highly influential. It has gained momentum in recent times and is going about its work with great purpose. The Government is, therefore, continuing to approach it very seriously.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">The Government has already set out our broad thinking on the principles which should shape and underpin Europe's future. I will shortly be setting out the Government's thinking on the broad range of issues arising in the convention in greater detail. In doing so, I will be drawing together the threads of work already under way. We do not, however, intend to publish a White Paper at this time. Debate in the convention is fluid and fast-moving and does not readily lend itself to such an approach. We are continuing to make submissions to its work. We are making detailed proposals on the issues being examined,  expressing concerns and setting out firm positions where these are appropriate, and generally contributing in a positive and constructive way to shaping the convention's agenda. This is the most effective way to advance Ireland's interests.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">There is, of course, a great deal of the convention's work which takes place away from its working groups and from the floor of the plenary. There is extensive networking in the margins and in bilateral and other meetings at European level. The Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, the Government's representative and I have availed of every opportunity to build alliances and to advance Ireland's interests in all such meetings. One regular forum is a dinner, during convention plenaries, attended by representatives of many of the smaller member states. The most recent of these was hosted by Greece. Ireland will host a similar occasion in January. I am sure that the House will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on discussions that take place at private meetings.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_102">I pay warm tribute to the work of the Irish representatives who are doing important and valuable work. We are fully committed to working together to achieve the best outcome possible for Ireland.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1049">The Government attaches great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is central to the protection and promotion of children's rights on a global level. The issue of child soldiers is of particular concern and Ireland has strongly supported international efforts to stop the use of child soldiers.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_103">In this context, I welcome Trócaire's efforts to promote ratification of the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">Ireland has now ratified this optional protocol and the instrument of ratification was deposited with the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York on 18 November 2002. The optional protocol is intended to provide greater protection to children in armed conflict. It prohibits compulsory recruitment of persons below 18 years of age into the armed forces. States are also obliged to take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces under 18 years of age do not take direct part in hostilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">A declaration by Ireland lodged with the instrument of ratification sets the minimum age at which Ireland permits voluntary recruitment into the Defence Forces at 17 years – except in the case of apprentices who may be recruited at the age of 16 but are not assigned to military duties until they have completed four years of apprenticeship training – and describes the safeguards in place to ensure that recruitment is not forced or coerced. Ireland's position in this regard is in full compliance with the terms of the optional protocol.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">The Government places great importance on the implementation of international humanitarian and human rights standards aimed at the protection of the rights of children especially those in conflict situations. The ratification of this important protocol signifies our commitment to make every effort to stop the involvement of children in armed conflict and to bring pressure to end the use of children as soldiers worldwide.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1055">The Government has welcomed the remarkable progress already achieved in Afghanistan in the past 12 months since the signing of the Bonn Agreement. We remain committed, at all levels, to the full implementation of the Bonn Agreement and the construction of a peaceful, democratic society in Afghanistan. This commitment was re-emphasised by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, at the conference held at Petersberg on 2 December to celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the agreement. Deputy Kitt made it clear that our commitment to Afghanistan was for the long-term, and that we would continue to play our role in the steps being taken to promote its lasting social and economic development. However, notwithstanding the progress achieved, the Government also recognises the enormous challenges remaining in all sectors – political, economic, humanitarian and reconstruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">At EU level, the special representative to Afghanistan, Mr. Francesc Vendrell, who is based in Kabul and has great experience of the region, is working closely with the Afghan authorities to implement the EU's policy in Afghanistan, in co-ordination with UN special representative Brahimi, and regional neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">An EU troika visited the region from 11 to 12 November. Its focus was to seek information about the status of the Bonn Agreement and the future requirements of Afghanistan for assistance. This mission provided an important opportunity to assess fully the progress made since the adoption of the Council conclusions and to discuss a roadmap for future co-operation between the EU and the Afghanistan Transitional Authority, ATA. The results of this troika will further inform our approach during the coming months.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_110">At UN level in October, the UN Secretary General, in his third report on Afghanistan, reported on the Administration's elaboration of a national development framework and budget. He also provided an update on the various commissions mandated by the Bonn Agreement – the Civil Service, constitutional, human rights, and judicial commissions – as well as other initiatives created by President Hamid Karzai. The Secretary General further set out the efforts by the international community to provide humanitarian assistance and to support the Afghan Government in reconstruction activities. He reported his concerns in relation to the security climate, in particular the growing number of acts of terrorism and political violence.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_111">As a member of the Security Council, Ireland continues to underline the crucial importance of a humanitarian strategy to parallel the political one. In early November, Ireland chaired an informal meeting of Security Council members to discuss human rights and other issues. Participants at the meeting agreed that a holistic, strategic approach encompassing reconstruction, security and economic development should be supported. At a further informal meeting of Security Council members on 11 December with the Director of the International Crisis Group, issues discussed included security tensions, the decision to form an Afghan national army, the disbursement of aid, security issues in the provinces, and the need for progress in the processes for constitutional, judicial and human rights.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_112">Ireland continues to provide bilateral assistance through Irish non-governmental organisations and international agencies. At the international conference on reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan, which took place in Tokyo in January 2002, the Government pledged €12 million in reconstruction support over a three year period. A sum of €5.3 million of that reconstruction pledge has been delivered to date. This figure includes €250,000 provided to the UNDP law and order trust fund in support of civil police capacity building in Afghanistan. An additional €3.3 million was delivered in emergency humanitarian assistance. In total, since 11 September 2001, Ireland has delivered €11.9 million in financial assistance to Afghanistan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_113">The EU is committed to delivering a major contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The Commission and individual member states made substantial contributions at the Tokyo conference, totalling €594 million for 2002 alone. As part of its financial contributions to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan, the EU has provided support amounting to $67 million to the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund in 2002. A further $49.5 million was allocated to the Afghan Interim Authority Fund. Further contributions are under consideration.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1062">At the fourth plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which took place in Armagh on 28 June 2002, an outline structure for the forum was agreed. It involved a twice-yearly conference, alternating between North and South and comprising representatives of civil society on the island. The planning and organisation of the first conference would be undertaken by a steering committee drawn from the Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the social partners in the South. The steering committee would also invite representatives from a range of relevant organisations, North and South, to participate in the conferences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Some progress had been made on implementing this Council decision prior to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly on 15 October 2002. However, with suspension, the Northern Ireland Civic Forum has effectively ceased to operate.

In this connection, I hope that it will also be possible to resume work on the establishment of the consultative forum as soon as possible.</p>

The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, and opposes and seeks the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography and trafficking in persons.

The protocol on trafficking not only provides for measures to suppress trafficking, but also for measures to protect the victims of trafficking. An end to trafficking of persons is a priority for Ireland and our EU partners. We will continue to work for the worldwide elimination of slavery in all its forms.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1078">In considering this issue, it is important to clearly distinguish between the campaigns to recruit, on the one hand, trainee police officers and, on the other hand, civilian support staff for the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">On 5 December, at a public meeting of the Policing Board, Chief Constable Hugh Orde referred to a process that took place some months ago to recruit civilian administrative assistants. This recruitment campaign attracted only 26 Catholics and 238 non-Catholic applicants. Officials of my Department subsequently raised our concerns about this matter with the British authorities. The response received indicated that the recruitment procedures in place at the time for the competitions in question were not sufficiently focused in their outreach. Efforts are being undertaken to address these problems in current and future competitions for police support staff.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_118">In relation to the recruitment of police officers, the Patten Commission recognised that it would be necessary to alter the composition of the police service in order to radically improve its representativeness, a necessary prerequisite for acceptable, effective and community-based policing. It recommended, therefore, that new police recruits should be selected on a 50:50 basis from both communities, drawn from a pool of suitably qualified candidates, for a set period of time. This recommendation is currently being implemented,  with recruitment of police trainees taking place at a target rate of 540 trainees per annum, which is in excess of that suggested in the Patten report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">There have been three competitions for new police trainees since the new arrangements were instituted in February 2001, all of which have been managed by an external recruitment consultant. In the first competition, 35.6% of applicants were drawn from the Catholic community, while 29% of the resulting merit pool of qualified candidates were Catholic. In the second competition, 38.7% of applicants and 25.9% of the merit pool of qualified candidates were Catholic. While figures for the third competition have not been finalised, figures available show that 35.2% of applicants and 26.2% of those passing the assessment tests are drawn from the Catholic community. There is currently no basis for the claim that Catholics have not been applying in sufficient numbers to become police officers in the PSNI to meet the 50:50 requirement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">When the Government endorsed the new policing arrangements back in August 2001, we said that the commitments then given by the British Government, in the context of the revised Patten implementation plan, could deliver the spirit and substance of the Patten report, and thereby the new beginning to policing promised in the Good Friday Agreement. A genuinely representative police service is at the heart of these new policing arrangements. The Government called then, and calls now, for support for the new police service from all communities in Northern Ireland.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1081">The Government is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty and accordingly seeks its universal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. The Deputy will be aware of the efforts we have made in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty to seek its universal abolition. The EU has pressed for abolition and has also issued <i>démarches </i>on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries, including China.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The EU guidelines adopted in 1998 set out clearly the common EU position on the use of the death penalty. These guidelines now form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, in death penalty issues. The Government is strongly of the view that an EU intervention carries significantly greater force than individual bilateral interventions by national Governments.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_121">The guidelines state, that where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where the facts of individual cases suggest a violation of basic minimum standards under international law, the Union will consider making a specific intervention.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_122">The EU discusses key human rights concerns with China in the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which provides a forum for an in-depth discussion of human rights in China. The dialogue has included an exchange of views on a wide range of human rights concerns, including the death penalty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_123">The formal human rights dialogues are complemented by biannual human rights seminars in which representatives from academia, the Judiciary and other experts from the EU and China participate. A seminar was held on 11 and 12 May 2001 in Beijing, specifically on the death penalty. The most recent seminar took place on 17 and 18 October in Copenhagen, during which the European Commission outlined the priorities for the dialogue, one of the most important being the abolition of the death penalty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_124">At the fifth EU-China Summit, which was held in Copenhagen on 24 September, both sides agreed to continue their dialogue on human rights and reconfirmed their commitment to work towards achieving meaningful results. Furthermore, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to respect international human rights standards and to co-operate fully with UN human rights mechanisms.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_125">The Irish Government uses every opportunity to seek the abolition of the death penalty and further the issue of human rights. During his meeting with Premier Zhu Rhongji in September 2001, the Taoiseach discussed human rights both in a private meeting and in the plenary meeting of the delegations. During my visit to China in January, I held discussions with Premier Zhu and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on a range of human rights issues and concerns.</summary>

These views are regularly conveyed to the Palestinian Authority through diplomatic channels.

They are carried out against the express wishes of the elected Palestinian leadership and despite its efforts to prevent such attacks. The suicide bombers must not be allowed to succeed.

          <p eId="para_1094">It is a matter of regret that the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus were not able to move forward at Copenhagen last week on the basis of the UN Secretary General's amended proposals. As the House is aware, the Copenhagen European Council decided that, as the accession negotiations have been completed with Cyprus, it will be admitted as a new member state of the European Union on 1 May 2004. In the absence of a settlement on the island, the application of the EU <i>acquis</i> will be suspended on the northern part of the island. However, the Council confirmed its strong preference for the accession of a united Cyprus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">The European Council welcomed the commitment of both sides to continue to negotiate with the objective of concluding a comprehensive settlement by 28 February 2003 on the basis of the UN Secretary General's proposals. If a settlement can be reached, it would still be feasible for a reunited Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May 2004. I very much hope that such an outcome will be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The European Council believes that the UN Secretary General's proposals offer a unique opportunity for the two communities to reach a settlement, and urged the leaders of the two communities to seize this opportunity. I also believe that the proposal can provide the basis for a lasting solution, which would we be in the interests of all parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">There is a window of opportunity for the parties to reach a settlement in the remaining few months before the EU Treaty of Accession for Cyprus is signed. Difficult decisions lie ahead, and both parties will be required to compromise on some long-established positions, but all sides have more to gain from a settlement than they do from the <i>status quo</i> on the island.</p>

It keeps us at sixth place in percentage terms in the international league table of donors, behind Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. At 0.41%, we are well ahead of the EU average. Maintaining our contribution as a proportion of GNP in these difficult times is a measure of the Government's clear commitment to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007.

          <p eId="para_1105">The Irish and British Governments agreed, by an exchange of letters on 19 November, that during the period of temporary suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, decisions of the North- South Ministerial Council on policies and actions relating to the implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland, or their respective functions, would be taken by the two Governments. The agreement was necessary because the North-South Ministerial Council cannot meet during the period of suspension. It was given domestic effect in this jurisdiction by the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act, 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">I am fully aware of the concerns of the Ulster Unionist Party on this matter. We discussed the issue at our round-table talks in Belfast 28 November, and I met a delegation from the Ulster Unionist Party, led by Sir Reg Empey, in Dublin on 11 December. I was pleased to have this further opportunity to reassure Sir Reg and his colleagues about the nature and intent of the temporary measures put in place by the two Governments. This temporary and remedial action is purely about good corporate governance and ensuring that the North-South Implementation Bodies can continue to carry out their day-to-day activities for the benefit of people in both parts of the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">I believe that all of the pro-Agreement parties accept that these seven all-island organisations exercise important public functions and provide commercially important services in both jurisdictions. They have been operational for three years now, employing a considerable number of staff. The House will appreciate that, as Governments, we had a responsibility to ensure that they continued to be able to discharge their functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">This joint remedial action by the two Governments was taken in the context of what we all hope will be a short-lived suspension. As Secretary of State Murphy has already indicated, we do not anticipate taking decisions other than those which are strictly necessary to ensure the proper care and maintenance of the bodies as they perform their essential functions. Members will recall that the supplementary agreement between the two Governments makes clear that no new functions can be conferred on the implementation bodies under these interim arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">We are all continuing to work together for the early restoration of the institutions, which will obviate the need for these temporary arrangements. The House will recall that our legislation makes specific and explicit provision for these arrangements to lapse on the earliest day practicable after the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is where our energy needs to be focused at this time. Tomorrow in Dublin, a further meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will be co-chaired by me and Secretary of State Murphy, and on the following day in Belfast the next round-table talks with the Northern Ireland political parties will take place.</p>

          <p eId="para_1113">In the past two years, both I and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, have received correspondence in which concerns were expressed regarding human rights abuses in Peru. The correspondence contained allegations which attempted to link the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, to reports of forced sterilisations in Peru. Related allegations were also the subject of investigation by a sub-committee of the Peruvian Parliament's health committee earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">In response, the UNFPA has repeatedly reiterated that it did not in any way support these practices in Peru or anywhere else. It is the policy of UNFPA, in the event of such allegations in any country, to take immediate action to investigate and, if true, to demand an end to such practices in line with the human rights based approach to family planning which it promotes. UNFPA states that it first learned about reports of involuntary sterilisation in Peru in late 1997 and expressed strong concerns to the Ministry of Health recommending investigations. At the request of the ministry, in February 1998 the Pan-American Health Organisation, PAHO, and UNFPA examined the issue and recommended measures to protect the rights of Peruvian women.

          <p eId="para_1117">I refer the Deputy to the response that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, delivered to a recent question on the issue of HIV-AIDS by Deputy Broughan on 13 November 2002. In the past decade, the AIDS crisis has emerged as perhaps the greatest development challenge. A UNAIDS report published recently detailed the facts about the global AIDS crisis. It stated that 42 million people are currently affected by HIV-AIDS and 22 million have died so far. The report confirmed that the worst-hit region is southern Africa, where the disease is magnifying the effects of famine and threatening the lives of 15 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">In the past three years, Ireland Aid has increased by tenfold the volume of funds committed to tackling the HIV-AIDS crisis. In 2002, approximately €45 million will have been spent on HIV-AIDS programmes by Ireland Aid. In January 2000, Ireland Aid published a strategy on HIV-AIDS which set out the framework for our HIV-AIDS programme. We were one of the first donors to have published a strategy of this kind. The fight against HIV-AIDS has now been fully integrated into our development programme activities. This strategy was supplemented by the launch by the Minister of State in October this year of a further publication on HIV-AIDS entitled "Experiences and Lessons of Best Practice in Addressing HIV-AIDS".</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">In June 2001, the Taoiseach headed Ireland's delegation to the UN General Assembly special session on HIV-AIDS. He was the only European Head of Government to attend the special session. In his address, he announced that Ireland Aid would spend an additional $30 million annually on HIV-AIDS programmes in developing countries. This special session adopted the Declaration of Commitments on HIV-AIDS, which governs the international response to the HIV-AIDS crisis. It serves as an internationally agreed framework which will hold political leaders accountable for their actions in attempting to curb the spread of this global epidemic.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_130">On World AIDS Day this year, 1 December at an event hosted by Deputy Kitt in the Department of Foreign Affairs and attended by a wide range of NGOs and representatives of the development community, the Taoiseach launched a booklet which reported on Ireland Aid's  response to the crisis. I have arranged to have a copy of the booklet forwarded to the Deputy for his information. It details the activities which Ireland supports at the global, regional and country levels. The event to launch it was preceded by a media campaign which highlighted the challenge posed by the crisis and Ireland Aid's response to it.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_131">The main aim of our HIV-AIDS activities is to help prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS and to reduce its economic and social impact in developing countries. To achieve this, three specific objectives have been outlined: strengthening the capacity of Ireland Aid as an organisation to respond effectively to the HIV-AIDS challenge; mainstreaming HIV-AIDS into our development programmes; supporting specific programmes that have been shown to be effective in terms of their impact on the progress of the pandemic.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">Ireland's approach is to fight AIDS on a broad front and to support organisations which have a good track record in prevention and care. In 2002, we contributed to major international initiatives such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, and the International Partnership for Microbicides. We are also supporting HIV-AIDS programmes which are being implemented through the work of a number of UN agencies, including UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNDP and the WHO. Specific HIV-AIDS strategies have been developed in Ireland Aid's six programme countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We also support the new HIV-AIDS partnership scheme, designed to channel additional financial resources to Irish NGOs in support of the HIV-AIDS programmes they are carrying out in developing countries. This scheme will have a budget of €5 million in 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">In his address to the World AIDS Day event, the Taoiseach confirmed that the special HIV-AIDS fund which has been established to combat the disease was not a once-off measure, but would be replenished on an annual basis.</summary>

During the ambassador's most recent visit to Ireland on 21 November, we reviewed political developments in Northern Ireland and I took the opportunity to reiterate the Government's commitment to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I stressed the importance of ensuring that all sides play their part in rebuilding confidence and in creating a context in which devolved government in Northern Ireland can be restored  in advance of the scheduled elections. In addition, I emphasised the Government's determination to work closely with those involved to resolve all outstanding difficulties, including in the vital area of policing. We also exchanged views on a range of international matters, including the Middle East and India-Pakistan. In relation to the Middle East, I stressed the importance of the work of the Quartet and, in particular, its efforts to agree a roadmap for the creation of a Palestinian state.</p>

I have on many occasions, together with our European Union partners, urged the necessity of lifting these measures to allow normal life to be restored for the inhabitants. It is particularly poignant for most of us in this country to see Bethlehem under siege at this holy season. I am aware that the Israeli authorities have indicated that President Arafat should not travel to Bethlehem to take part in the Christmas ceremonies at the Church of the Nativity. I have also stated that confining President Arafat plays into the hands of extremists. I would certainly urge the Israeli Government not to interfere with the traditional ceremonies in Bethlehem and to assure freedom of worship to all who wish to attend.

          <p eId="para_1127">The person to whom the Deputy refers was convicted of treason on charges of espionage and sentenced  to four years in prison by the Russian Pacific Fleet Military Court on 25 December 2001. Following his conviction, the then EU Presidency in February last expressed the serious concern of the EU on the case in a <i>démarche </i>made to Mr. Yevgeny Gusarov, the then Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The response of the Minister was that the case related to a judicial rather than to a governmental decision. The Minister stressed that freedom of speech and the media was one of the most important gains for democracy in Russia. The subsequent appeal made to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court against the conviction was rejected on 25 June. Although the court did alter some parts of the sentence, these do not have any effect on its execution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The person's lawyers have asked the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, Mr. Lebedev, to pass the case to the Presidium of the Supreme Court for consideration. This supervisory appeal, looking into the legality and foundations of the decision taken by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court on 25 June, was filed by the lawyers on 21 October. Mr. Lebedev has asked the chairman of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court, Mr. Petukhov, to consider the complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">The person is eligible for parole on 25 December. Any decision on parole would be a matter for the prison parole board, followed by a court decision. I understand that any such decision would probably not be taken until the end of January 2003. The person has already refused a presidential pardon as this would imply a recognition of guilt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">Together with our partners in the EU, Ireland will continue to follow closely developments in this case. We will continue to urge the Russian authorities to take measures to allow the plurality of the media in Russia to be preserved and strengthened.</p>

          <p eId="para_1138">The Copenhagen European Council recalled the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council of December 1999 which state that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria which apply to the other candidate countries. These criteria include the political criteria laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993, which stipulate that candidate countries must have achieved "stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities".</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">In this respect, the Government believes that it is necessary to ensure that, as with all candidate countries, Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria before any accession negotiations can begin. The European Council encouraged Turkey to pursue energetically its reform process. I welcome the decision of the European Council and hope it will encourage Turkey to continue its efforts to fulfil the terms of the Copenhagen criteria. The human rights reforms which have been adopted over the past year represent an important step in the right direction.</p>

They discussed Turkey's application and the new Turkish Government's proposals for reform. Mr. Erdogan stressed his determination to put an end to the use of torture and human rights abuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">The new Turkish Prime Minister, Abdullah Gul, wrote to Prime Minister Rasmussen on 7 December outlining the reform measures introduced to Parliament by the new Government, namely a package of 31 legislative reforms introduced on 3 December concerning the following: freedom of expression, association and religion; and improvements to the judicial process and eradication of torture, and an additional package on 4 December – retrial arrangements for cases heard by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_1144">The EAPC is a political framework for discussions in the broad Euro-Atlantic area on matters such as the future development of peacekeeping, as well as on non-military matters such as disaster relief in Europe. Grounded in the basic principles of the UN Charter and the OSCE basic documents, its work complements and reinforces the work of other international organisations. Ireland has found participation in the PfP and EAPC to be of particular benefit in the peacekeeping area, especially through the development of enhanced interoperability which is improving our ability to undertake peacekeeping operations in a safe and effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The EAPC meeting on 22 November was the first meeting at the heads of state and Government levels since Ireland joined PfP in December 1999. Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and was joined by representatives from other EAPC states, which include other European neutral and non-aligned states such as Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_135">The EAPC meeting in Prague focused on the broad theme of the future direction of PfP and of the EAPC in the twenty-first century. Two papers in particular provided a focus for discussion. A Comprehensive Review of the EAPC and the PfP outlined proposals for further developing partnership. This text included a number of innovations and adaptations for the EAPC and PfP. These included greater political and security-related consultations, enhancing interoperability in peacekeeping operations, a reflection of broader approaches to security, improved liaison, more regional co-operation and greater involvement in decision-making, as well as proposals in the civil-military area. Ireland had no difficulty with the text, which in no way altered the partnership's core approach of self-differentiation. This  means each participating country can decide on the extent of its participation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_136">Representatives also considered a Partnership Action Plan Against Terrorism, which contains proposals for further co-operation among partners in the post-11 September context. The plan is set in the context of UN Security Council Resolution 1373 which aimed to strengthen the global response to terrorism, and is complementing efforts under way in other international organisations. It provides a loose framework to expand some existing EAPC activities that contribute to combating terrorism. This includes, for instance, intensified consultation and information sharing, enhanced preparedness for operations against terrorism, means of impeding support for terrorist groups, ways of contributing towards the management of the consequences of terrorism, as well as assistance for individual EAPC countries efforts against terrorism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">It is clearly stated that the core principle of self-differentiation also applies to the plan in that the efforts against terrorism outlined are open to all EAPC participants that are willing and able to contribute.

          <p eId="para_1154">The UN has a permanent presence in Jenin in the form of UNRWA, the UN agency charged with providing relief and assistance to Palestinian refugees. The reports of this agency make very disturbing reading and suggest a pattern of interference with the activities of the UN and other relief and medical agencies in Jenin and other refugee camps. It will be recalled that an international official of UNRWA, Mr. Ian Hooke, was recently killed by Israeli forces during an incursion into the Jenin refugee camp.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">The issue of UN access and the safety of UNRWA personnel has been raised with the Israeli Government by senior representatives of the United Nations and by the European Union. Regrettably, these representations appear to have had little effect. Ireland has supported calls for Israeli withdrawal from areas such as Jenin in the Security Council of the United Nations. On 29 September last I issued a statement calling on Israel to conduct itself in a manner fully consistent with international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention which imposes an obligation to protect civilians. The Commissioner General of the UNRWA, Mr. Peter Hansen, visited Dublin in October and was received by the Minister of State at my Department with special responsibility for overseas development and human rights, Deputy Kitt. They discussed Ireland's current programme of assistance to UNRWA and ways in which we could better assist the important work of the organisation, as well as political developments in the area.</p>

Moreover, they saw this work as playing a vital role in consolidating peace and political agreement. Accordingly, the parties to the Agreement pledged their continuing support for such organisations and agreed to positively examine the scope for enhanced financial assistance for the work of reconciliation. In line with this commitment, in 1999 the Government increased the funding available to this Department's reconciliation fund to €2 million, an eightfold increase on the previous year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_149">In the past four years the increased funding – in aggregate, more than €10 million – has enabled my Department to make over 300 grants to organisations involved in a wide range of cross-community and cross-Border reconciliation and  outreach activities. The larger allocations from the reconciliation fund are provided to organisations that operate on an all-island basis – for instance, Co-operation Ireland and the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation. However, many smaller organisations, working on a localised basis across the community interface or in co-operation with partner bodies in the other part of the island have also benefited from the fund.</summary>

As regards the involvement of the local authorities, I was pleased to note that the three long-standing local authority cross-Border networks are to play a key role in the implementation of approximately €54 million of the INTEREG 3A programme, which was launched in Newry on 20 November 2002.</summary>

In July 2002, the Minister of State launched a new debt relief strategy Policy on Developing Country Debt, which had been agreed with the Department of Finance. This updates and develops the Government's position on the debt crisis which had been issued in September 1998. Immediately after its launch, this strategy paper was formally presented to the World Bank and the IMF by our national representatives in both these institutions.</p>

In the coming months, we will monitor closely developments in the HIPC process and participate actively in all relevant international meetings.

          <p eId="para_1183">The  Government has consistently condemned the paramilitary "exiling" of people from their place of residence as an abuse of their human rights. The right of all citizens to freely choose where they wish to live is a fundamental right which has been recognised in the Good Friday Agreement. The flagrant and egregious breaching of this right by paramilitary groups is unjustifiable. I have frequently called on all the political parties associated with paramilitary organisations to make every effort to get those organisations to desist, and to ensure that all "exiles", wherever they currently reside, can return safely to their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">One of the difficulties associated with the issue of exiling has been the absence of accurate information available on the extent of the practice. This issue has been the subject of discussions with the British authorities who have informed us that, while statistics on reported incidents of general intimidation are maintained, official figures are neither compiled nor issued by the police on the number of people exiled by paramilitaries. However, media reports earlier this year estimated that several hundred people have been forced from their homes and are currently unable to return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">As the Taoiseach has previously made clear, the best way of ending these practices is through community-wide support for policing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1192">The fighting between Government troops and the rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, LURD, has been ongoing in Liberia since late 2001 and has had a devastating effect on the country. The mounting toll of deaths, displacements and the general suffering of local populations underlines the urgent need for both parties to negotiate a ceasefire and to work towards national reconciliation. Human rights violations have been committed by both sides and human rights defenders continue to be detained without trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">The already grim humanitarian situation has been exacerbated by poor harvests and the disruption caused to farming activities by the conflict. Liberia is struggling to provide not only for its own population, but also for the thousands of refugees pouring into the country to escape fighting in neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire. In 2002, Ireland contributed €160,000 to Concern for its rapid onset emergency response project in West Liberia and €196,000 for an emergency health program of the International Rescue Committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">Arising from concerns about negative developments in Liberia in the areas of human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance and corruption, the European Union initiated consultations with the Government of Liberia in November 2001 under Articles 96 and 97 of the Cotonou Agreement. During the consultations, which ended in March, the European Union undertook to resume its co-operation programme with Liberia once Liberia meets specific conditions in a number of areas, including human rights. On the occasion of a follow-up meeting on 6 December 2002 with the Liberian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the European Union delegation conveyed the Union's concern at the ongoing poor human rights in the country, including the harassment of civilians by Government troops.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_170">The United Nations Security Council has also  been active in attempts to bring stability to the Mano River region. Targeted sanctions were imposed on Liberia in May 2001 after a panel of experts clearly demonstrated that President Taylor was supporting Revolutionary United Front, RUF, rebels fighting against the Government of Sierra Leone. The RUF were notorious for the human rights abuses they committed during the decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">The most recent report of the panel of experts, released this October, provided clear evidence that Liberia has been actively engaged in efforts to violate the various sanctions measures, in particular the arms embargo. In addition, far from expelling the members of the RUF as demanded by Resolutions 1343 and 1408, Liberia has assimilated between 1,250 and 1,500 of them into elite government military units. As a Security Council member, Ireland supported the continued application of the sanctions against Liberia on the basis that the peace that has been established in Sierra Leone is extremely fragile and, as evidenced in this and other areas of west Africa, any interference in the security and stability of a country by neighbouring states has the most tragic consequences and is to be condemned.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">At the Security Council Ireland has also expressed support for the proposed new mandate for the UN office in Liberia, UNOL. The mandate includes a specific human rights component which will allow the UNOL to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Government of Liberia on human rights issues, and assist in strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law in Liberia. The UNOL will also be tasked with contributing to and monitoring the preparation for free and fair elections in 2003. The Security Council has recently been engaged in defining a comprehensive strategy on Liberia with a view to promoting a stable and democratic political process which addresses humanitarian issues and promotes national reconciliation and the protection of human rights. Ireland has been actively engaged in these discussions.</summary>

The conference, and its joint secretariat, which comprised officials from the two Governments, promotes bilateral co-operation on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments. The agreement provides that, in addition to facilitating co-operation in security matters, the conference will address the areas of rights, justice, prisons and policing in Northern Ireland and will intensify co-operation between the two Governments on the all-island or cross-Border aspects of these matters. As such it provides a forum in which we can raise matters of concern with the British Government.

In particular, it noted the widespread use of torture and the strike hard campaign, which has resulted in an extremely high number of death sentences and executions. The GAC also expressed its concern about restrictions against unofficial churches and religious groups, as well as the deprivation of religious and cultural rights in Tibet and Xinjiang.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_176">The GAC reaffirmed that the human rights dialogue with China is one of the Union's channels to improve the situation in areas of concern. The GAC noted that this dialogue is an acceptable option only if enough progress is achieved  and reflected on the ground. The GAC determined that the EU will continue to evaluate the results of the dialogue at regular intervals, to determine how far its expectations have been met. The EU will also continue to express publicly its concerns about human rights in China and to raise them in meetings with China at all levels. At an ambassadorial level meeting between the EU Troika and China, held in Geneva on 5 December, the human rights issue was again raised, and the Chinese side reiterated its commitment to pursue and intensify the human rights dialogue with the EU.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1686">The PPF provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes, ALMPs, to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. Indecon International Economic Consultants were commissioned by my Department on behalf of the standing committee to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the overall effectiveness of existing programmes, and to help inform the deliberations of the standing committee. This report has recently been finalised by the consultants and submitted to my Department following discussions with a steering group representative of the standing committee. The report was discussed on a preliminary basis with the social partners and Departments represented on the standing committee on 5 December 2002. The standing committee will continue its work on overall appraisal of ALMPs early in the new year, taking due account of the consultant's report.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_191">The consultants were invited to consider and make recommendations on the appropriate active labour market programmes that may contribute in the future to national competitiveness to the maximum extent possible, by increasing labour supply, through the integration of unemployed persons into the labour market; eliminating any remaining disincentives to employment, identifying any gaps or anomalies between various interventions, and securing the fullest possible measure of rationalisation and overall consist ency; re-orienting ALMPs, including the development of the training component of community employment, so that the collective focus will be on the needs of the most marginalised and disadvantaged groups – the long-term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities, travellers, refugees and asylum seekers with permission to work, women, lone parents, dependent spouses, young people who are disadvantaged, ex-offenders – to ensure the emphasis is on progression to, and is relevant to the needs of, the open labour market; future provision to meet the needs of those who are severely disadvantaged in the open labour market for whom ALMP participation is inappropriate, or who may not benefit from participation from enhanced intervention by the employment services under the proposed high support process; placing the emphasis firmly on training and progression, including the enhancement of progression pathways between education, training and the workplace through specific skills training and pre-labour market programmes; cost effectiveness of each programme having regard to, where appropriate, the impact of the national minimum wage; arising from the review, to advise on appropriate data collection systems and benchmarking of progression with a view to effective monitoring and appraisal of the performance of ALMPs; the optimum approach to ensuring that all potential customers – that is, the persons at whom the ALMPs are targeted – are made fully aware of the range of interventions and are encouraged to participate, and to develop new methods of disseminating information, if appropriate; and the appraisal should take account of rural/urban and partnership/non partnership areas differentials. The overall cost of the consultancy work, including value added tax, came to €57,130.75. A decision on publication of the report is a matter for the standing committee in the first instance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">The 2003 Estimates provision will allow for an average participation rate of approximately 22,000 in 2003, which remains a significant level of commitment to community employment given the current level of long-term unemployed. Consideration of appropriate levels of community employment for the future will be informed by the work of the standing committee on the labour market and other reviews of the community employment programme currently under way.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1690">I understand that when the extent of the difficulties facing the company began to emerge, the board and management of IFI considered a very wide range of options for the company which might provide a basis for establishing a viable business going forward, most of which would have entailed the Arklow plant remaining operational. Unfortunately, despite the identification of a number of significant cost savings as part of the efforts made to save the company, it was not possible to establish a basis for a viable future and the board decided that it had no option but to cease trading.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">At this stage, the liquidator of IFI is responsible for the disposal of the assets of the company, including the Arklow plant. In this regard, the role and responsibilities of the liquidator are well established under company law and I have no role in giving any instructions to him. Of course, it would be open to any new buyer of the Arklow site, who was proposing to operate a suitable business activity at the plant, to enter into discussions with the State's development agencies. I should point out that the responsibility for the granting of any support to individual companies, and for the level of support, if any, is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies concerned, and is not one in which I am directly involved.</p>

The amendments being introduced by the Minister for Finance are aimed at making the post of Registrar of Credit Unions, to be established within IFSRA, accountable to the authority through the chief executive.

Unlike our proposed legislation, the UK does not have a separate statutory post of Registrar of Credit Unions. Under the UK regime, which again is different from our approach, credit unions are subject to the same basic regulatory requirements that apply to other lending and deposit-taking institutions. However, I am aware that the FSA has, over time and in consultation with credit unions, tailored some of its rules to meet the particular needs of the credit union movement.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1704">There is no legal requirement for a person to be tried with an offence under military law or the ordinary criminal law before they are dismissed from the Defence Forces. This principle was upheld by the High Court in 1979 in a case where Mr. Justice Findlay found that there was a "clear public necessity" that the military should have the discretion to remove persons considered to be a security risk. The statutory provisions under which members of the Defence Forces may be discharged or retired are contained in the Defence Act and the relevant Defence Forces regulations. Where it is proposed to discharge or to retire a member of the Defence Forces compulsorily, the person concerned is afforded the opportunity to submit an appeal against such proposed discharge or retirement.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_195">The Judge Advocate General, Ms Oonah McCrann, completed her review of the circum stances surrounding the retirement of the person referred to and submitted her report to me on 17 September 2002. The report was released by me on 2 October 2002. The essential findings of the Judge Advocate General were that, following a review of all of the documentation held by the Department of Defence and by the Defence Forces, she had failed to uncover any evidence whatever to sustain the range of allegations which have been made concerning the circumstances of the individual's retirement in 1969. Her detailed inquiry led her to the conclusion that no practical or substantial benefit would be derived from holding any further inquiry into this matter. In accordance with the specific recommendations of the Judge Advocate General, all documentation relating to the events leading up to the individual's retirement has been made available to his legal representatives. A full copy of the Judge Advocate General's report was forwarded to his legal representatives before the findings were made public.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1726">Controls on the import of meat into the EU from third countries are set down in EU legislation. There is free circulation of meat produced within the EU but there are uniform EU wide controls on the production of such meat. All animal product imports from third countries must come from establishments in those countries which are approved by the EU and bear an EU health mark except in certain instances when a product may be imported under licence. The Food and Veterinary Office of the EU carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU will be approved. Where the Food and Veterinary Office is satisfied that public health requirements are  not being met by premises in those countries, the establishments may be removed from the EU approved list.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">Consignments coming from third countries must be imported through an approved border inspection post upon first entry into the EU. Aside from having the necessary documentation for tariff processing by the customs authorities, importers are required to be registered with my Department and give at least 24 hours advance notice to the border inspection post at which their consignment is to be landed. An official health certificate conforming to model certificates set down in EU legislation must be presented. Goods failing to comply with the veterinary control checks carried out at the border inspection post may be detained for further examination and if necessary they may be destroyed. Once products have met with all required conditions, they are released for free circulation within the EU. There are over 700 importers of animals and animal products registered by my Department at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728">In response to growing concern relating to food labelling, including labelling of imported food, I established a group to examine the current labelling framework in the context of consumers' expectations and, in particular, to identify whatever gaps there are either in existing legislation or the manner in which it is implemented. The group has now reported and has made a series of recommendations and I will be making a response early in the new year.</p>

Based on his own declarations the person named had a stocking density of 1.9941 livestock units per hectare. This would appear to qualify him for extensification premium at the low rate of payment. However, the Department is required to check applicants' declarations at census dates against the CMMS database to  ensure that the declarations and the database are in agreement. The outcome of this cross-check in the case of the person named has shown a discrepancy involving five animals. When these five animals are taken into account the stocking density of the person named is in excess of two livestock units per hectare.</p>

          <p eId="para_1742">Rationalisation of the beef processing industry is a matter for the industry itself and I have no direct function in the matter. I am aware that the beef processing sector has formulated plans to rationalise its own structures and bring about a greater alignment of slaughter capacity with cattle throughput. There is no question of Exchequer moneys being made available to compensate factory owners for the closure of slaughter facilities and therefore the question of State Aid under EU law does not arise. I am also aware that the Competition Authority is conducting an investigation of proposals to restructure the beef processing industry pursuant to the Competition Act, 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1743">From an overall policy point of view, it is generally accepted that the beef processing sector has excess slaughter capacity. This was one of the main findings in a study of the sector carried out by McKinsey in 1998. The findings of this study and the recommendation that excess capacity should be removed were accepted by the beef task force in its report, published in 1999. The task force, which comprised representatives of the Department, farming organisations, the beef processing industry, State agencies and SIPTU, in considering the McKinsey findings recommended that the industry itself should create a special fund to facilitate the rationalisation process and remove surplus capacity.</p>

          <p eId="para_1745">Under EU beef labelling regulations operators involved in the production and marketing of beef are required, since January 2002, to include on their labelling an indication of the country of origin of the animal from which the beef was derived. I am aware that some meat factories in Northern Ireland may now be reluctant to accept for slaughter cattle born in the Republic of Ireland, but which were reared or finished in Northern Ireland, because an indication of Irish  origin will not permit them to apply a British beef label to their product as required by some of their UK customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746">While the purchasing decisions by both traders and retailers are commercial and a matter for themselves I would, nevertheless, be concerned if EU labelling rules were to lead to a distortion of the traditionally strong trade in live cattle to Northern Ireland and for that reason I have asked that the matter be kept under review. I have brought my concern on this matter to the attention of the Northern Ireland authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1752">Section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for retirement relief for farmers from capital gains tax in respect of gains arising on the disposal of the farm, subject to certain conditions being met. This section also allows participants in the 1992 scheme of early retirement from farming, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, to avail of this relief. Extending this relief to participants in the 2000 early retirement scheme would require an amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This matter will be examined in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1754">It is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the special savings incentive scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. Using the existing data and assuming that these variations will broadly cancel each other out, it was estimated that the full year cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of €525 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1755">However, anecdotal evidence is that significant numbers of account holders recently raised their monthly contributions, and on that basis the 2003 budget tax forecasts prudently assumed a total annual cost of the order of €600 million to 2005. As the cost depends on customer behaviour, about which no-one can be certain, I cannot give a more definitive figure of future costs to the Exchequer, but obviously the costings are kept under ongoing review and analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1756">The main benefit to the State of the scheme is that it will encourage a regular pattern of savings. The scheme should also be seen in the context of this Government's philosophy that we should as a people provide for the future. This policy has seen not just the introduction of this scheme, but also measures to encourage individual pension provision and the national pensions reserve fund. The scheme has attracted 1.17 million participants, and I see the popular and widespread participation in the scheme as a vindication of it and the principle behind it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1758">Global valuation provisions were first introduced in the Valuation Act, 1988. The Act provided for property used for the primary purposes of a public utility undertaking to be valued as a single entity and apportioned between rating authorities by ministerial order. The 1988 Act prescribed that the basis of valuation, net annual value, of a public utility undertaking valued on a global basis shall be 5% of the effective capital value. ECV consists of site value, plus the depreciated replacement cost of other property of the undertaking.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_196">To date one utility, the ESB, has been valued on a global basis. All other utilities have been  valued and entered on the valuation lists on a conventional basis. The global valuation of the ESB was last revised in 1998 and is due to be revised again in 2003. The 1998 ESB global valuation was apportioned as follows: 75% of the valuation of an electricity generating station was apportioned to the rating authority in which it was situated; the balance of the global valuation was apportioned to each rating authority in proportion to the population of each authority, as per the following schedule of apportioned valuation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_197">The Valuation Act, 2001, which came into effect on 2 May last, continues with modifications to the 1988 global valuation provisions. However, no public utility undertaking has yet been valued or apportioned under these new provisions.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1902">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, from the information supplied by the Deputy, the taxpayer's employer may be deducting tax at the emergency rate. This occurs when no certificate of tax credits has issued in respect of an employee. A certificate was not issued in this case because the tax office was not informed that the taxpayer was in employment, nor was any application for a certificate of tax credits received. The Inspector of Taxes wrote to the taxpayer on 12 December 2002 requesting the information needed to determine the tax credits to which the taxpayer is entitled. A temporary certificate has been issued, which will ensure that with effect from 1 January 2003 the taxpayer will not be taxed at the emergency rate. To obtain a refund of tax overpaid in 2002, the taxpayer should obtain a P60 – certificate of pay, tax and pay-related social insurance – from her employer as soon as possible after 31 December 2002 and send it to her Inspector of Taxes who will refund the overpaid tax as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1904">The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that claims from non-resident individuals and companies to repayment of, or exemption from, Irish tax are dealt with in accordance with the terms of the relevant double taxation agreements, and/or  relevant domestic legislation, the VAT Act, 1972, and the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The following table sets out refund/exemption activity for the latest full year, that is 2001, under the main tax subheads arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_1905">With regard to capital gains tax, figures are not compiled in such a manner so as to readily indicate refund activity. The position is that non-resident persons are chargeable to capital gains on the disposal of certain specified assets, including land and buildings in the State. Where the consideration for the disposal of such assets exceeds €500,000, the person paying that consideration must deduct 15% and remit it to Revenue, unless the vendor produces a CGT clearance certificate. Where 15% is deducted, the vendor of the asset is entitled to offset this payment against any capital gains tax due on the disposal. Where this amount exceeds the tax due, a repayment is made of any tax overpaid. I am also advised that entitlement to rebates is based on the tax residence status of the applicant as distinct from nationality, and accordingly the further analysis requested is not available.</p>

          <p eId="para_1937">The position is that in the Finance Act, 2001 I merged and standardised the conditions of the four tax reliefs for third level education into a single relief. The scope of the relief was also considerably widened. Generally speaking, the tax relief now covers tuition fees paid by undergraduate students in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU. It also applies to fees paid by postgraduate students both here and abroad. Undergraduate courses, which may be full or part time, must be of at least two academic year's duration while postgraduate  courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic year's duration. Tax relief is available up to a maximum of €3,175 per annum at the standard rate of tax. The relief is restricted to tuition fees paid and does not include amounts paid in respect of registration fees, maintenance or other expenses incurred by third level students.</p>

          <p eId="para_1991">The change in the excise rate applicable to alcopops announced in the budget is expected to raise extra revenue in the region of €12.7 million in a full year. Since 1996, a lower rate of duty has applied to lower strength spirit-based drinks including alcopops. This lower rate was introduced to provide for broad equivalence of treatment with beer of similar strength. Market development means that alcopops are now considered to be spirit drinks in their own right and, as such, are more likely to compete with ordinary strength spirits and mixers than with beer. Indeed, the market for spirit based alcopops has trebled since 1997. As with the increase in the spirit excise rate, the restoration of the full spirit rate for alcopops is also aimed at contributing to tackling health and public order problems associated with excessive consumption of such drinks, particularly by younger people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1993">The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is responsible for nuclear safety and verification and security of nuclear material and installations. India, Pakistan and Israel are not states parties to the non-proliferation treaty, nor have they entered into comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA. Consequently, IAEA inspections cannot take place in those countries. Ireland has always called on these three countries to adhere to the non-proliferation treaty. Ireland strongly supports United Nations Security Council Resolution 1172, passed in June 1998, which, <i>inter alia</i>, calls on India and Pakistan to become parties to the non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty. The resolution also calls for an immediate stop to their nuclear weapons development programmes including development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_200">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea admitted on 4 October that it had a programme to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. This put them in violation of the non-proliferation treaty. Ireland considers that the serious breach of international obligations in general and of the non-proliferation treaty in particular this admission represents should be reflected in the response of the international community. Ireland fully supported the EU Council conclusions of 19 November which reiterated concerns regarding the nuclear programme and strongly urged the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea to come into full compliance with all of its international commitments. The Council underlined the point that the future of North Korea's relations with the international community is conditional on P'yongyang's prompt and verifiable actions to dismantle its programme. The EU continues to consult with key partners, such as South Korea, Japan, the USA, China and Russia.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_201">Ireland supports strongly the resolution passed by the board of governors of the IAEA which,inter alia, calls on North Korea to allow a senior team from the IAEA to visit the DPRK without delay to inspect their uranium enrichment programme. With regard to other weapons of mass destruction, 145 countries are states parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. All states parties to the convention are subject to inspections by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW. Under the terms of the CWC, site inspections can be carried out to establish if states parties are engaged in weapons programmes. India and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are not states parties to the Bacteriological and Toxins Weapons Convention, BTWC. Ireland supports universal adherence to this important convention and we have advocated the further strengthening of the BTWC in the area of verification to allow for inspections of facilities which are suspected of being capable of producing bacteriological and toxin weapons.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2011">UN Security Council Resolution 1368 was adopted on 12 September 2001, one day after the terrorist attacks on the United States. The resolution condemns the attacks of 11 September and expresses the deepest sympathy to the victims and their families and to the people and Government of the United States. The resolution calls on all states to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of the terrorist attacks and also calls on the international community to redouble its efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts including by increased co-operation and full implementation of the relevant international anti-terrorist con ventions and security resolutions. Ireland has contributed to the implementation of the resolution on a wide number of fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_2012">Through our membership of the Security Council, we were involved in the drafting of UN Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted on 28 November 2001, which imposes obligations on member states under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and particularly emphasises measures that must be taken to combat the financing of terrorism. Resolution 1373 led to the establishment of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee, in which Ireland has actively participated. In the context of our membership of the European Union, Ireland participated in the drawing up of an EU action plan on terrorism, agreed at the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 21 September 2001. Implementation of the action plan is monitored on an ongoing basis by the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_2013">UN Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373 called upon all states to fully implement all international anti-terrorist conventions. There are 12 universal conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, all of which are already in force having been ratified by the minimum number of states specified in the respective instruments. Ireland is party to five of the 12 universal conventions. The position regarding the seven outstanding conventions is as follows: Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, 1991 – following consideration by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs on 5 December 2002, the Government hopes to secure Dáil approval for the terms of this convention, which would permit accession by Ireland; Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents, 1973; International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, 1979; International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, 1997; International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 1999 – the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is expected to publish a Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill this week for consideration by the Oireachtas early in 2003. Its enactment would permit the Government to immediately make arrangements for Ireland to become a party to these four Conventions; Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988; Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms on the Continental Shelf, 1988 – a Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and Offshore Fixed Platforms Bill is being advanced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for publication in early 2003.

Most of this increase will arise under subhead B, the bilateral grant-in-aid, including significant increases in funding for NGOs, while there will also be sizeable increases in our support under subhead C for development programmes administered by missionaries. Multilateral assistance, subheads E and F of Vote 39, will also increase from an estimated €46 million in 2002 to some €50 million next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2024">Overseas development assistance is likely to be in the region of €450 million next year, compared to some €420 million in 2002. This increased allocation for next year will be the highest ever allocation in the history of the programme. Emergency and post emergency recovery operations will continue to receive significant funding from within the Ireland Aid budget. Emergency and related funding has been rapidly increasing in recent years and, owing to the current food crisis in Africa, these increases are likely to continue. To date this year, the Government has intervened to provide emergency and rehabilitation assistance on more than 134 occasions in 35 countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central and Latin America and Eastern Europe. In particular, there has been a strong focus on the food security crisis currently devastating southern Africa and the Horn of Africa regions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_208">Ireland Aid delivered €9 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance for the affected countries in southern Africa and over €7 million for the Horn of Africa since the start of the crisis this year. Funding has been allocated to key international agencies such as the UN World Food Programme as well as Irish and international non-governmental organisations providing supplementary nutritional support. A high level of emergency and recovery assistance was also allocated to Afghanistan from the 2002 Ireland Aid budget –€8.6 million to date this year. This  focus is likely to continue in 2003. In addition to the Government's emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is also delivering long-term development support to these regions with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. In 2002 it is estimated that such support for southern Africa will exceed €80 million. Additional resources for humanitarian assistance will be available also through the new multi-annual programme scheme due to be launched by Ireland Aid in 2003. The scheme is an innovative mechanism for funding some of the major Irish development NGOs through three year joint programmes and is expected to provide greater flexibility for the NGOs as well as enhanced predictability. The scheme will support a wide range of rehabilitation and development activities including post-emergency rehabilitation programmes, food and livelihood security programmes and emergency preparedness activities in a wide range of countries. The Government will continue to address the great humanitarian need which exists throughout the developing world, both through the provision of increased resources and their innovative use.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2026">Conflict prevention and the alleviation of humanitarian crises in Africa are foreign policy priorities. During its two-year period of membership of the UN Security Council, Ireland has contributed actively to efforts to resolve conflicts in many regions of Africa, including the Great Lakes region – Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, the Horn of Africa – Ethiopia-Eritrea and Somalia, the Mano River Union region of West Africa – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and Angola. Significant progress has been made towards securing peace in many of these countries. The wars in Sierra Leone, Angola and Ethiopia and Eritrea are over, the belligerents in the DRC have just reached an agreement to form a transitional Government, one of the major rebel groups in Burundi recently signed a ceasefire agreement with the Government and the Somali factions are currently engaged in peace negotiations in Kenya.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_210">During our period of membership, Ireland took part in Security Council missions to the Great Lakes region and to Ethiopia and Eritrea. We have contributed financially to the Ethiopia-Eritrea boundary commission, the Sierra Leone  special court and the truth and reconciliation commission set up to ensure that there is no impunity for crimes committed during the decade-long civil war. We have also contributed to the inter-Congolese dialogue in the DRC and, most recently, to the UN trust fund for peace building in Somalia.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_211">Ireland also works to resolve conflicts and alleviate humanitarian suffering in Africa through our membership of the European Union and, bilaterally, through the Ireland Aid programme. The European Union is, in most cases, the biggest financial contributor to peace processes in Africa, especially in regard to the inter-Congolese dialogue in the DRC and to efforts by the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, to resolve the conflict which has recently erupted in Côte d'Ivoire. The EU also uses the instruments available through its common foreign and security policy such as Council declarations and common positions to attempt to positively influence circumstances in conflict countries in Africa.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_212">The European Union is a major contributor to efforts to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of people affected by disasters in Africa. This year, both the European Union and Ireland Aid have placed a particular emphasis on the food shortages affecting six southern African countries, including Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and on the emerging food crisis in Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 2002 alone, Ireland Aid has delivered almost €9 million in emergency humanitarian relief for southern Africa and over €7 million for the Horn of Africa. In our contributions to efforts by the Security Council and by the EU to resolve crises in Africa, Ireland has consistently sought to maintain a focus on the need to tackle the human rights abuses and humanitarian emergencies that so often accompany these conflicts. We will continue to maintain that foreign policy emphasis in the lead-up to our EU Council Presidency in 2004.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_213">The UN has a major role to play in responding to humanitarian emergencies throughout the world. In relation to the gathering famine in Africa, the World Food Programme is the key  UN agency tasked with identifying food stocks and delivering them to the millions in dire need of food assistance. Other agencies, such as UNICEF, UNHCR and FAO, play important supporting roles. The humanitarian effort is co-ordinated by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA. At the moment the World Food Programme estimates that up to 38 million Africans are directly affected by severe food shortages on the continent. Southern Africa and the Horn of Africa account for 28 million of these. The other shortages are spread through western and central Africa. Approximately 60% of WFP's work takes place in Africa. The WFP's budget for Africa is about US $1.4 billion of which US $700 million has been raised. In relation to the delivery of food aid, the WFP has been Ireland's largest partner in recent years. In 2002, Ireland contributed €8.4 million to WFP operations. WFP distributes food through NGOs and a number of Irish NGOs have agreements with WFP to distribute food to those most in need.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_214">Ireland Aid monitors WFP operations through ongoing contacts at headquarters, visits to the field and consultations with NGOs which are partners of WFP. In general, the feedback has been very positive regarding WFP's operational capacity and its ability to get food as quickly as possible to those most in need. The deputy executive director of WFP, Jean Jacques Graisse, visited Ireland for talks with Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, senior Ireland Aid officials and NGOs. The crisis in Africa was covered in detail and the deputy executive director outlined WFP's requirements over the coming months. WFP currently feeds 80 million people worldwide.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_215">The alleviation of starvation in Africa will require a complex and multi-disciplined approach addressing all key sectors and with particular emphasis on agriculture and rural development. The Government is actively addressing these complex issues bilaterally and with our partners in the European Union and the United Nations. To date this year, the Government has intervened to provide emergency and rehabilitation assistance on more than 74 occasions in 14 African countries. This emergency and rehabilitation assistance amounts to more than €20 million. In addition to the Government's emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is delivering long-term development support to famine-affected countries in Africa with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. Food security needs are addressed as part of this approach. Long-term support to southern Africa currently exceeds €80 million per annum and similar support for Ethiopia will exceed €27 million in 2003, making Ireland one of the largest donors in that country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_216">Beyond the immediate food requirements for Africa, the Government will continue to work  with its EU and UN partners to address the underlying structural problems which led to cyclical food shortages. It is only through the achievement of long-term development that the recurring famines in Africa can be reduced. Nevertheless, it is imperative that we continue to respond quickly to alleviate the suffering of those worst affected by humanitarian emergencies.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2086">I propose to take Questions Nos. 207, 218 and 247 together.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_219">The report of the task force on autism is lengthy and complex. It contains approximately 180 individual recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues. The scope of these recommendations means that a multi-faceted response is called for. My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing  the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with autism in line with the recommendations of the task force.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_220">A key development on the structural front has been the decision to establish a national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including those with autism. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are well advanced. A chief executive has recently been appointed and the objective is that the council will be vested by the end of March 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_221">It is also my intention to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to confirm the rights and entitlement of persons with disabilities, including those with autism. The objective of this legislation, which will be based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, will be to provide a statutory guarantee of education services for persons with disabilities. The Bill will provide a clear and enforceable statement in law of the rights of children and adults who because of disabilities have special educational needs and will propose to put in place a statutory structure, which will guarantee their education. My Department is involved in consultations with interested parties in relation to the measures proposed in this legislation. My objective is to advance this legislation as speedily as possible with a view to enacting it before the summer recess.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_222">In the meantime, investment in special support services for children with autism is continuing to develop. To date, approximately 90 special classes dedicated to children with autism have been established. Further such classes are being established on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs. Each class caters for a maximum of six pupils and is supported by a teacher and two special needs assistants. Children attending such classes attract a special rate of capitation funding at a rate of €582.50 per annum. Such children are also entitled to avail of the special school transport service which includes escorts on school buses. Expenditure on the special transport service in the current year is estimated at €40 million, with an additional €4.4 million being spent on the escort service. In addition to school based provision, my Department is currently funding a number of projects using the applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism. Annual expenditure on projects using the ABA method in the coming year is likely to be in excess of €3 million.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2125">I propose to take Questions Nos. 220, 221, 227 and 228 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2126">Substantial improvements have been made with regard to the number of Traveller children participating in the education system. Information to hand indicates that participation at primary level is very close to 100% and that the estimated 5,500 Traveller children involved are enrolled in age appropriate classes in primary schools. Indications also suggest a very high level of initial transfer to second level but that significant drop-out occurs in the first year. However, the numbers participating at second level have increased substantially from 600 to 1,384 since 1997. The majority of Traveller children leave mainstream schooling prior to completing the junior cycle. A small percentage transfer to senior Traveller training centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_2127">Key initiatives taken by my Department in the area of Traveller education include:</p>
          <p eId="para_2128">– the dissemination of "Guidelines on the education of Travellers in primary and second level schools" aimed at facilitating greater access to schools and to ensure that Traveller children will participate in and benefit fully from the education system. These guidelines issued to all primary and post-primary schools in March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2129">– the introduction of the school completion programme which is aimed at promoting the retention and participation in schools of those most at risk or potentially at risk of early school leaving. This includes the use of tracking systems to ensure that pupils, including Traveller pupils, are retained in school and supported in making the crucial transition from primary to post-primary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_2130">– the appointment of a national education officer for Travellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2131">– the visiting teacher service for Travellers involves 42 teachers who are specifically dedicated to supporting the participation of Traveller children in the education system and working with Traveller families to this end. The operation of this service is managed by my Department's inspectorate and the visiting teachers are located throughout the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_226">The policy is to support the full integration of Traveller children in mainstream schools. Traveller children attending primary schools are supported by approximately 400 resource teachers for Travellers. My Department also allocates additional teaching resources to second level schools to cater for the special needs of Traveller children. The additional allocation is generally of  the order of 1.5 hours per pupil per week. To date, 124 whole-time equivalent teaching posts have been allocated to support Traveller children at second level.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_227">There are four special schools dedicated to the specific needs of Traveller children for whom placement in a mainstream school would not be appropriate. A network of 29 senior Traveller training centres provide integrated education, vocational training and work experience for Travellers aged 15 and upwards who have left school early with minimal or no qualifications in a culturally supportive environment. Special classes are also provided for adult Travellers under the various adult education schemes. In line with the commitment in the PPF my Department appointed a high level officer to take a lead role in co-ordinating the development of a continuum of supports to facilitate Traveller participation in education at every level. However, the person appointed to this position has recently transferred to work outside the Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_228">Arrangements will be made to appoint a replacement officer early in the new year. While there has been no assessment of the literacy attainment levels of Traveller children to date, the view is that Traveller children at primary level are on average two years behind the settled age cohort in terms of literacy levels. The gap increases as Traveller children approach post-primary level. Many Travellers opt out of post-primary school because of difficulties with literacy. A significant proportion of young adult Travellers have difficulties with reading and writing. Significant resources are being made available to tackle low literacy levels. Resource teachers for Travellers focus particularly on literacy issues.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_229">An evaluation of the pre-school service for Travellers was carried out by the education support and research unit of my Department. The report which will be published shortly makes significant recommendations in the whole area of pre-school education for Travellers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_230">My Department intends to evaluate Traveller education at primary and post-primary levels in the near future. Preliminary plans are in place and it is hoped to initiate the evaluation during the present school year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_231">The National Education (Welfare) Bill was enacted by Dáil Éireann in July 2002. It deals primarily with the following issues: non-school attendance; issues relating to the educational welfare of children experiencing difficulties in school attendance; and early intervention in addressing the problem of non-attendance. The Bill raises the minimum school leaving age to 16 or the completion of three years of the junior cycle, whichever is the later. This development involves the first ever national response to supporting school attendance and should make a positive contribution to improving participation rates among Traveller children.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2142">The person referred to by the Deputy served with City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee as a lecturer in the College of Marketing and Design up to May 1977 when she was suspended from duty. She never returned to service. She sought a pension from the committee in 1991 under the terms of the local government superannuation scheme but the committee decided that the lecturer was not entitled to payment. She was notified of this decision by letter dated 8 July 1992. In accordance with the provisions of the scheme, the lecturer was entitled to appeal, within a period of six months of being notified of the decision, to the Minister for the Environment. No appeal was made within the required period.</p>
          <p eId="para_2143">The lecturer died in September 2000. Her sister subsequently entered into correspondence with the VEC and with this Department regarding the lecturer's superannuation entitlements.

        <summary eId="sum_232">It is not clear from the correspondence which has come to light that the lecturer was advised of her right to appeal at the time when her application for a pension was refused in 1992. Although there is no reference to the right of appeal in the letter of 8 July, it is possible that she was advised of her rights in this regard in previous correspondence and the letter of 8 July makes specific reference to earlier letters. My  Department has requested copies of these earlier letters from the VEC.</summary>

The information in regard to the number of one, two and three teacher primary schools is being compiled and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2161">In recent years many improvements have been made to assist principal teachers in the performance of their duties and to relieve their administrative burden. The scheme of release time was introduced for the 2000-01 school year. This scheme enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions. The number of days release time granted is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school. Substitution paid by my Department is provided for the days that principals are on administrative leave. The number of release days granted was further increased for the current school year and boards of management were advised of the increase in a recent circular issued by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2162">Arising from the implementation of the PCW agreement, significant improvements were introduced to the management structure of primary schools by the allocation of additional posts of responsibility. It is a matter for the boards of management of schools to delegate functions to post of responsibility holders. The number of posts of responsibility range from two posts of responsibility in a two teacher school to, for example, 20 posts of responsibility in a 40 teacher school.</p>
          <p eId="para_2163">In addition to the above, funding to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking services has increased from the €50.79 per pupil that applied in the 2000-01 school year, to the €102 per pupil that issued in March 2002 to all eligible schools. This rate will increase further next year to €127.</p>

It is expected that a pilot project will commence in the 2003-04 school year on the implementation of this project. The implementation of this project and its extension in primary schools in the next few years should help to further reduce the administrative burden on boards of management and principal teachers.</p>

This figure encompasses 17 RAPID proposals that I have approved, in whole or in part, relating to a number of areas including third level access, adult and community education, education guidance counselling, resource teachers, teaching hours as well as capital refurbishment or extension projects. I have also recently allocated more than €5 million to vocational education committees in Dublin City, Dublin County, Dún Laoghaire, Cork City, Louth and Limerick City Vocational Education Committees under the new back to education initiative, BTEI, which will provide important second chance education opportunities in these communities. A proportion of these block allocations will facilitate some funding of RAPID area applications. Decisions on allocations to individual projects within these amounts are a matter for individual vocational education committees. In addition, I recently appointed 34 community education facilitators as a new nationwide service operating under the vocational education committees who will be an important resource for RAPID areas within their remits.</p>

          <p eId="para_2182">While there are currently no plans to formally evaluate the computer literacy of students at primary or post-primary level, my Department is funding the appointment of two specialist officers to the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, to monitor and evaluate the development of computer skills in school and to promote the effective use of computers in the curriculum. The officers, who are due to be appointed shortly, will work in close collaboration with the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, so that issues relating to information and communications technology, ICT, in the curriculum may be progressed at both first and second level.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_234">The NCCA has advised me that, rather than introduce a stand-alone, computer-based subject at junior or leaving certificate level, the focus at both primary and post-primary levels should be on the use of ICT as a teaching and learning tool and its integration across the curriculum. To this  end, guidelines for teachers on the use of ICT are being prepared by the NCCA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">At both first and second level, students are encouraged to use ICT and to develop their skills in this regard. At post-primary level, in particular, a number of subjects provide opportunities for students to incorporate the use of ICT in their work, including the preparation and presentation of project and folio work in the State examinations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">At leaving certificate, students may undertake a school-based, optional module in computer studies. This does not form part of the leaving certificate, but students who take it, and perform satisfactorily, will be given a statement to that effect by my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">I should add that the determination and evaluation of computer skills in education is a matter of ongoing discussion at international level.

          <p eId="para_2184">There are nine vocational education committee outdoor education centres formally recognised for the purposes of grant aid. Funding for these outdoor education centres was originally approved on the understanding that they would be self-financing. Accordingly, my Department's annual grants are contributory in nature and the allocations go towards the staffing and equipping costs involved in running the centres.</p>

      the drop-out rate of students at undergraduate level at third level colleges in 2000 and 2001; his proposals to assist in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_2209">The statistical information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. The most recent figures on attrition rates for third level education are the result of research carried out, at the request of my Department, by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, at St. Patrick's College Drumcondra, Dublin which published surveys of completion rates in undergraduate courses in the institutes of technology in 2000 and in the universities in 2001. In the case of the universities the average drop out rate was found to be 15% while in the case of the institutes of technology it was found to be 42%. It should be noted, however, that there were differences between fields of study in both surveys with the subject areas of computer science, engineering and science registering higher non-completion rates than the humanities and business studies. The Dublin Institute of Technology also conducted a similar study and shows an overall non-completion rate of 39.46% for the 1994 cohort of full-time first-year students.</p>
          <p eId="para_2210">A number of initiatives to tackle the issue of student retention is already being funded by my Department. In the case of the universities, the Higher Education Authority has allocated almost €1.95 million towards supporting a range of activities including the development of mentoring and study skills programmes, counselling services, information packs for new entrants, development of orientation programmes and life skills modules and the appointment of academic counsellors, access officers, school liaison officers and mature student officers.</p>

The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector and the profile has been made available to all the institutes. Since 1999, additional funding has been provided to the technological sector to address the area of non-completion. This funding has supported the appointment of retention officers and school liaison officers, provision of additional advisory services including counselling, academic support and career guidance, the establishment of staff training seminars, upgrading of orientation programmes and the expansion of mentoring programmes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_241">Further qualitative research published earlier this year by the ERC has identified possible causes for non-completion in the institute of technology sector. The evidence presented in the report suggests that a number of factors has a significant impact on retention including students' preparedness for college, their suitability to the course, students' experiences of courses and college, teaching practices and the degree to which an institution can promptly identify a student at risk.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2275">Last May my predecessor, Deputy Michael Woods, announced the provision of an extra 175 training places in the areas of physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_2294">There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling €120 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Michael Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_2295">The measures which are funded under the third level access fund are: the fund for students with disabilities; the student assistance/access fund; the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage; the special rates of maintenance grant; the establishment of the national office for equity of access to third level education start-up funding in 2000 for access officer posts within the technological sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_2296">The fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by the Department of Education and Science, aims to assist students with disabilities in third level institutions and PLC colleges to participate in further and higher education. Grants are provided for students who have serious sensory, physical and/or communicative disabilities. Financial support is available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college.</p>
          <p eId="para_2297">A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families.</p>
          <p eId="para_2298">Special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as "top-up" grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2299">A key recommendation of the action group on access to third level education was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report. I have now given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education within the Higher Education Authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_2347">A regime to limit fishing activity and access to western waters, including the Irish Box, was put in place in 1995 in order to provide for a rational and orderly exploitation of fishing grounds by all vessels, including the Spanish fleet. I am of the view that the provisions which govern conservation in the Irish Box should continue after the end of 2002. It is clear that the Commission has been of the same opinion in so far as it did not envisage an end to the western waters regime in its Green Paper on CFP reform or in the proposals for reform introduced in June 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2348">The legal opinion received from Council Legal Service at the end of October provides that the western waters regime expires as from 31 December 2002. This is contrary to the Commission and Ireland's previous view on this issue and in my view is incomplete and flawed. The advice of Ireland's legal services on the matter has been conveyed to the Commission and the Danish Presidency, and I will continue to contest the Council Legal Service opinion in Council this week.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_248">I have also been involved in an intensive series of meetings at European level to draw attention to the very serious consequences arising for fish stocks and for the Irish fishing industry if unrestricted access to the Irish Box is allowed from the beginning of next year. I met Commissioner Fischler and the Danish Minister for Fisheries, who currently holds the Presidency of the Fisheries Council, three weeks ago, and I have maintained close contact with both in the past week on this issue. I have also met the Portuguese and the UK Ministers with responsibility for fisheries, both of whom share some common ground with Ireland on this issue. I have strongly pressed Ireland's case that the waters within the Irish Box are very sensitive and play an important role as nursery grounds for stocks in western waters and beyond. The need to maintain and enhance going forward the current restrictive regime, which is  fully justified on the grounds of conservation and rational exploitation of fish stocks, was strongly emphasised. At Council this week I shall continue to do my utmost to preserve the current regime in the interests of the Irish fishing industry and of conservation of fish stocks.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2351">The trust of the study was to recommend two separate, but complementary, developments at Rossaveel. Development A provides for the provision of a dedicated ferry berth with a depth of three metres and a limited amount of dredging in the inner harbour and navigational channel.

The study went on to recommend further phased developments including the provision of a purpose built ferry terminal building.</p>

          <p eId="para_2355">Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for stock management in the western lakes Corrib, Mask and Carra is a matter for the Western Regional Fisheries Board. There has been no evaluation carried out, to date, to determine either the appropriateness or success of the stocking out of hatchery fish into Irish waters. The Central Fisheries Board has recently drafted a discussion document on the use of hatcheries to augment wild brown trout stocks. The fisheries boards are at present formulating a policy based on the document. My Department's support for such controlled hatcheries programmes in the future will be informed by the advice of the fisheries boards.</p>

          <p eId="para_2477">A number of public health initiatives aimed at improving public health is currently under way. These will continue to operate and be further developed next year along with some new initiatives.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_256">In the area of population screening programmes, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the  Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. My Department is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the phased expansion of the programme and the linkages with the symptomatic services. I have invested substantially in the development of symptomatic breast services and further development is required.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_257">Phase one of the cervical screening programme is under way in the Mid-Western Health Board since October 2000. This is a major undertaking with significant logistical and additional resource implications. The experience gained from phase one will assist in planning and implementing a national programme towards which end consideration is currently being given to the carrying out of an external review of phase one during 2003. In addition, other issues relating to management of the national programme, are also being examined by the chief executive officers of the health boards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_258">The "Best Health for Children" report recommends a core child health surveillance programme for those in the zero to 12 age group. Additional funding to date, in excess of €2 million, has been used to employ key people at regional level to drive the implementation process and also to pilot projects aimed at establishing best practice in the area. One of the priority areas identified in the report requiring attention is that of training of staff involved in delivering the core surveillance programme. With a view to facilitating the efforts of boards in implementing the recommendations of the report, particularly with regard to the provision of training, an additional €700,000 has been provided for 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_259">Routine antenatal testing was introduced in 1999 and is effective in identifying women who are HIV positive at an early stage in pregnancy. These women can be treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy, which reduces the risk of the baby acquiring HIV by up to 66%. Since its introduction, when the positive HIV status of the mother is know antenatally, the perinatal transmission rate has so far been less than 1%. Anonymous unlinked testing of HIV is also taking place. The aim is to have an above 90% uptake rate of the linked programme before discontinuing the unlinked testing.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_260">In regard to immunisation a number of key programmes are under way. The primary childhood immunisation programme is a key element of the public health service in Ireland today. The programme provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the system parents may have their children immunised free of charge by a general practitioner of their choice.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_261">The national immunisation programme against Group C meningococcal disease commenced in October 2000 with the objective of immunising the population up to 22 years of age.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_262">Phase 1 of the programme targeted those at greatest risk, that is, children under five years of age and young persons aged 15 to 18. Phase 2 of the programme commenced in March 2001 and targeted primary school children as a priority as well as post-primary students aged 12 to 14 years. Young persons aged 19 to 22 years were targeted when phase 2 was completed. All phases of the catch up programme were completed in 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_263">The vaccine has been incorporated into the primary childhood immunisation programme for children up to two years of age. Since the introduction of the vaccine there has been a dramatic reduction in Group C meningococcal disease in Ireland. There have been no deaths due to Group C meningococcal disease to date in 2002 compared to three deaths for the same period last year (2001). None of the three people who died had received the meningitis C vaccine.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_264">In the area of environmental health, a draft national environment health action plan, NEHAP, "A Shared Vision for Quality of Life", has been prepared by a review group established under the aegis of my Department. In many countries NEHAPs are seen as a tool for achieving sustainable development and implementing integrative approaches and local actions to the benefit of the population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_265">An advanced draft of the NEHAP has been circulated to Departments and lead agencies involved in environmental health for comment and observations. The draft will be amended in the light of observations received and will then be submitted to Government with a view to publication as soon as possible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_266">In the area of fluoridation I established the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was recently launched and its main conclusion was that, subject to the recommendations of the forum, the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_267">Since publication, I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum to oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations made and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_268">In the area of tobacco control, I intend introducing further measures to protect the public from the effects of tobacco, particularly in the area of environmental tobacco smoke. In this regard the Deputy may wish to note that the Public Health (Tobacco) Act passed all stages in the Oireachtas earlier this year and became law on 27 March 2002. Part 2 of the Act has been brought into operation and the Office of Tobacco Control has been established.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_269">In the area of health promotion, the health promotion unit of my Department has responsibility for the implementation of the Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 and the cardiovascular strategy, Building Healthier Hearts. This has resulted in the development of a wide range of health pro motion programmes, initiatives and campaigns aimed at improving health. These programmes and campaigns will be further developed next year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_270">In the area of food safety the European Commission's White Paper on Food Safety sets out plans for a proactive new food policy aimed at modernising food legislation into a coherent and transparent set of rules, reinforcing controls from the farm to the table, and increasing the capability of the scientific advice system. Over the past 12 months my Department has played, and over the next year will continue to play, an active role in the development of legislative proposals arising from the White Paper through its representation on various EU working groups and through participation at the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_271">I believe that the ongoing programmes in public health that I have outlined are important and worthwhile initiatives which will contribute to improving people's health and quality of life.</summary>

This was one of the reasons I established the benzodiazepine committee in June 2000 and I recently launched its report. The committee also drew up good practice guidelines for clinicians. The treatment of drug misusers forms part of these guidelines, which have now been circulated to general practitioners and to drug services within the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_2579">In addition, while awaiting the publication of the committee's report and guidelines, it was felt that interim measures should be put in place with regard to benzodiazepine usage amongst the drug using community who were attending drug treatment clinics. A proposal was developed by the committee to reduce sources of multi-prescribing to known drugs users. The objective was to identify either the clinic practitioner or the patient's general practitioner as the doctor who would take the lead role in prescribing benzodiazepines or psychotropic drugs. It was also recommended that in general the lead, with the agreement of a client's general practitioner, should be with the drug treatment clinic. Following consultation with the three area health boards in the eastern region, the committee's chairman wrote to the area health board chief executives in April 2001 advising them of the new arrangements to be put in place.</p>

In particular, €14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €3.3 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of school going age.

          <p eId="para_2589">Many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists.

My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or enhancement in line with agreed services developments for children using the resources allocated to the services.

          <p eId="para_2599">Since 1998 a total of just under €31 million has been provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards for the provision of technical aids and appliances to people with physical and sensory disabilities. The Western Health Board received more than €3.3 million of this funding. Arising from savings made in 2002 my Department has recently provided an additional €50,000 to the WHB specifically for the provision of aids and appliances to children with physical and sensory disabilities. This figure brings the total allocated for aids and appliances to the WHB in 2002 to just over €0.8 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2600">In 2003 a figure of €1.463 million in additional funding has been identified for the WHB in respect of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Included in this figure is a sum of just under €1 million to be used for priority service pressures as identified by the board. It is at the discretion of the health board to decide as to how much of this funding should be directed towards aids and appliances having regard to other service pressures in the region.</p>

Statistics are not available on the number of unaccompanied minors who have disappeared at appeals stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_2659">As many as 428 unaccompanied minors reached the age of 18 prior to the determination of their application for asylum at first instance.

      <b>Cecilia Keaveney</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      the impact which the capping of the Civil Service numbers will have on Garda recruitment; and if he will make a statement on the need for a maintenance of existing Garda levels and an expansion of the force.

          <p eId="para_2723">The authorised strength of the Garda Síochána currently is 12,200. As the cur rent actual strength of the force has not yet reached this figure – it now stands at approximately 11,900 – my first priority is to bridge that gap by making maximum use next year of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College, bringing the strength of the force to its highest ever level.</p>
          <p eId="para_2724">As long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, it will not be possible to recruit sufficient additional trainees to progress further beyond 12,200.</p>

      asked the

      the reason for discrepancy in the number of deportation orders signed in 2001 and 2002; the number effected; the status of the 1,660 not deported in 2001 and the 1,668 not deported in 2002; and the number who are currently here.

          <p eId="para_3414">A total of 4,320 deportation orders were made between 1 January 2001 and 12 December 2002 with the following results: over the same period 918 persons have been deported or left the State before their deportations could be effected. This represents an enforcement rate of over 20% which compares favourably with  repatriation experiences in other EU states; 2,985 persons have evaded deportation or are not at the last address notified to the Department. It is not known how many of these are still in the State but it is suspected that many may have already left. Those remaining are now subject to arrest and detention and are being sought by the Garda National Immigration Bureau; and a further 178 deportations are at various stages of arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_3415">The majority of the remaining orders have been either revoked for legal reasons or the persons have been granted leave by the High Court to seek judicial review of the decision to deport them.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_313">The increase in the numbers of orders made and effected in recent times as reflected in the  figures above is attributed to the additional resources allocated to my Department's immigration division and to the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_314">On 16 and 23 July this year, the Garda carried out Operation Hyphen as part of its ongoing investigation to identify persons residing in the jurisdiction who have not complied with the immigration laws. A total of 140 persons were arrested on immigration related matters, including 16 persons evading deportation orders. A further 74 were charged with immigration related offences and one sought asylum. The remainder were released without charge. As a result of the operation, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of non-EEA nationals who are registering at the Garda National Immigration Bureau and at local Garda registration offices as they are required to do under the provisions of the Aliens Order 1946, as amended.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_315">The immigration division of my Department actively encourages persons who might otherwise be deported to return voluntarily to their countries of origin and has enlisted the help of the International Organisation for Migration to assist with this task. Currently the IOM is focusing on the return of Romanians, Nigerians and CIS nationals. The number of persons who voluntarily repatriate has increased significantly over the past four years as evidenced by the figures below.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_330">The figures above represent persons who applied for refugee status and were refused and persons transferred to another country under the Dublin Convention. They do not include persons who are deemed to have been staying illegally in the State and who did not apply for asylum status. The immigration division of my Department actively encourages persons who might otherwise be deported to return voluntarily to their countries of origin, and has enlisted the help of the International Organisation for Migration to assist with this task. At present the organisation is focusing on the return of Romanians, Nigerians and CIS nationals. The number of persons who voluntarily repatriate has increased significantly over the past four years as evidenced by the figures below.</summary>

      <b>Mr. R. Bruton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      if he has satisfied himself with the enforcement of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 in respect of under age drinking in view of the fact that only eight convictions have been secured in the entire Dublin region since its commencement in 2000; and his proposals to ensure that more cases are prosecuted and more convictions secured.

          <p eId="para_4064">I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 and 343 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4065">The main legislative provisions relating to underage drinking are set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. The 2000 Act provides for a considerable strengthening of the law in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to underage persons, including increases in fines for breaches of the law on under age drinking. Serious penalties, including temporary closure of a licensed premises, can result where a licensee is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an underage person.</p>
          <p eId="para_4066">As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no role in the investigation, prosecution or trial of alleged offences, which are matters for the Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts. This is a long standing principle of our system of justice. I am, nevertheless, satisfied that the existing legislative provisions and their enforcement are adequate to deal with the problem of underage alcohol consumption, in as much as the issue is one for the criminal justice system. In this regard, the problem requires a much broader response than that capable of being provided by State agencies alone. In particular, it falls on all parties with an interest in this matter, including the drinks industry, the media and parents, to play their part in addressing under age alcohol abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_4067">Details of prosecutions, convictions and closure orders obtained since the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 came into force to 13 December 2002 are set out in the table below.</p>

          <p eId="para_4310">A Government commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness requires that "every Department will take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service at an early date". Accordingly, it is the responsibility of each individual Department to consider the question of the action to be taken against agencies under their aegis that fail to reach the  3% target for employment of people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_4311">A monitoring committee established and chaired by my Department helps to monitor and guide progress in relation to the target. It has supported a number of initiatives in recent years including approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to, chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this option at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April 2001; and commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations.</p>

My Department, in partnership with the Equality Authority, launched an employer resource pack on 3 December 2002 to assist public service employers in the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities. My Department also collects data in relation to the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service, excluding the Civil Service data which is collected by the equality unit in the Department of Finance. Although the target has yet to be achieved, there has been a degree of progress over the past number of years.

        <summary eId="sum_340">My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to a review of the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment target. Departments met the target in the mid-1990s. However, since then the percentage has dropped below the target and as at December 2001 the percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%. The fact that the percentage has dropped below 3% is a cause for concern and the Department of Finance has written to the all heads of Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their legal obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_341">All Departments are required to appoint a disability liaison officer to act on behalf of people with disabilities within Departments. In 2001, the Department of Finance established a network of disability liaison officers which meets regularly. A programme of special training for all disability liaison officers and human resource managers in Departments was held in March and April 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_342">In light of the commitment in the PPF and in order to establish how to improve adherence to the target, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Civil Service Commission, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service. The research, which was carried out by a team led by Goodbody economic consultants, is completed and will be published in early 2003. The research maps out the current arrangements in respect of career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face when seeking to progress their careers and makes recommendations for a model of best practice in this area for the future. The Department of Finance is considering the recommendations and will be making proposals shortly.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4328">Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may by regulations provide for the issue of an age card to those who have already attained 18 years of age and are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_343">The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations, 1999, set out the detailed provisions in relation to the application and authentication procedure as well as procedures for the preparation and issue of age cards. This scheme, which is operated by the gardaí, is designed to assist licence holders to comply with legislative provisions relating to under-age drinking by providing evidence of age where a doubt exists. I am pleased to say that the latest figures available to  me indicate that over 80,000 age cards have been issued by the gardaí to date.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_344">The 1999 regulations do not preclude the use of other forms of identification for proof of age purposes. However, in any proceedings against a licence holder for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it is a defence for the defendant to prove that an age card issued under the 1999 regulations was produced by the person in respect of whom the charge is brought. As the Deputy may be aware, serious penalties, including temporary closure of licensed premises, can result where a licence holder is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an under-age person.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_345">In short, a licence holder must be satisfied that a customer has attained the age of 18 years and is, therefore, entitled to seek an age card under the general common law right to seek reassurance that one is not breaking the law in entering into a contract. The Equal Status Act, 2000, does not impinge on this right.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4342">I can confirm that my Department has received the formal application from the United Kingdom authorities for transfer of the person concerned. It is being reviewed by the State's legal officers to ensure that the requirements of the Council of Europe Convention on  the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997, are satisfied. I await their advice in the matter before deciding whether to give my consent to the application.</p>
          <p eId="para_4343">It should be noted that the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions to allow an application to be fully considered. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of these consents, assuming they are forthcoming, an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his or her continued detention here.</p>
          <p eId="para_4344">These procedures are required under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act and must be adhered to in processing each application. Every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_351">In relation to Limerick, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the necessary refurbishment work on a room in Henry Street Garda Station to accommodate the CCTV monitoring suite and associated equipment is almost complete. I am also advised that camera sites have been selected and the provision of the required civil works and ESB supplies are progressing. Wayleave issues are also being processed. My Department is also in consultation with Limerick City Council about the planning process for the CCTV system.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4574">In addition to the temporary transfer of additional gardaí to traffic duties in the Dublin metropolitan region, Operation Freeflow also involves the prohibition of most road works on all main arteries in and around the city. However, local authorities have to be given an opportunity to improve roads and maintain services even though this may result in traffic disruption. I am sure the Deputy will also appreciate that while improved traffic flow can take precedence over some other policing duties at certain times, this would not be feasible on an ongoing basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_4576">The current position is that all ranks within the Garda Síochána up to chief superintendent are eligible for a pension if they have a minimum 30 years service and have reached the age of 50 years. Members of ranks up to and including inspector must retire at 57 years of age. Superintendents and chief superintendents must retire at 60 years of age, as must those of commissioner rank appointed after 1996. Assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners appointed before 1996 must retire at 65 years of age. The age differential was established some time ago and recognises that there are greater physical demands on gardaí in frontline operational policing roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_4577">The commission on public service pensions has recommended that the minimum retirement age for new entrants to the Garda Síochána should be raised from 50 to 55 years and that members should have the option of being retained to a maximum age of 60, rather than 57, subject to meeting minimum health and fitness standards. My objective is to have a fit, active and experienced force with an appropriate balance as regards the age profile. I am reviewing the retirement ages applicable to the Garda Síochána with this aim in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_4578">The current authorised strength of the Garda Síochána is 12,200. As the current strength of the force has not yet reached this figure – it now stands at approximately 11,900 – my first priority is to bridge that gap by making maximum use next year of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College, bringing the strength of the force to its highest ever level. As long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, it will not be possible to recruit sufficient additional trainees to progress further beyond the figure of 12,200.</p>

          <p eId="para_4589">Ballycroy National  Park, County Mayo, was designated as such with effect from 1 November 1998. It comprises 11,800 hectares of some of the most important blanket bog in Europe in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg area of north west Mayo.</p>
          <p eId="para_4590">Ballycroy National Park is already accessible to the visitor along the Bangor trail, south of Bangor Erris, as well as from Srahmore points which are to the north and south of the national park, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_4591">Due to the sensitive nature of the landscape of the national park and its designation as a special area of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive 1992, provision was made under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for my Department to construct a visitor centre in the village of Ballycroy which it is intended will interpret the park and will attract a larger number of visitors to the general area.</p>
          <p eId="para_4592">This visitor centre project is being developed in consultation with representatives of the various local community organisations in Ballycroy as well as the Office of Public Works and Mayo County Council, and plans for the proposed scheme are at an advanced stage. It is the intention that these plans would include sewage works for the village of Ballycroy, as well as access roads and bus and car parking on the visitor centre site itself, to be undertaken by Mayo County Council. A site for the centre has already been purchased by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_4593">I am currently undertaking a review of all capital heritage projects planned for my Department under the national development plan, including that for the Ballycroy National Park, and I hope to be in a position to make a decision on further funding allocations for this programme in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_4595">Since March 2000 group water schemes associated with quality deficient private sources are eligible for a 100% grant for the installation of water treatment and disinfection equipment. To ensure the most cost effective delivery and operation of such equipment, and to secure long-term protection of the related capital investment, my Department's procurement policy in this area is based on design-build-operate contracts, coupled with the bundling of individual projects under a single contract. The same policy applies to smaller public water services schemes. My Department has recently produced a comprehensive procurement guidance document to assist local authorities and  group schemes in the implementation of this policy and I am arranging to have a copy sent to the Deputy.</p>

The most recent information received from local authorities indicates that more than 3,000 grants were paid in the period 1 January to 31 July 2002. At that date, some 4,500 applications were approved while local authorities had a further 6,700 unapproved application on hands.</p>

          <p eId="para_5333">The national biodiversity plan, which was published by the Government in April 2002, provides a framework necessary for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity over the next five years. The plan was developed taking account of the European Community biodiversity strategy, adopted in February 1998, and is designed also to comply with the obligations of the UN Convention on Biodiversity, which Ireland ratified in 1996, to produce at national level plans to conserve biodiversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_5334">Implementation of the plan, which is at a preliminary stage will depend on all action by a range of sectors and stakeholders. All Government Departments, local authorities and relevant State agencies have been contacted and advised of the elements of the plan coming within their remit. A number of meetings have been held with key stakeholders. Representation on the interdepartmental biodiversity steering group is being expanded to drive forward implementation. I intend also that, early next year, guidelines for preparing biodiversity action plans will be finalised for Departments, State agencies and local authorities.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_6942">My Department amended the terms of the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme in November 2001 to provide that up to 25% of accommodation in new projects undertaken by voluntary bodies throughout the country with assistance under the scheme may be allocated to elderly emigrants returning to this country who satisfy eligibility criteria drawn up in connection with the safe home programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_6943">Allocation of accommodation under the amended scheme is not contingent on persons being included or accepted for inclusion in the housing authority assessment of housing need. Instead, specified conditions in relation to their present circumstances and inclusion in the safe home waiting list are relevant. This obviates the need for elderly emigrants to have returned before they are considered for voluntary housing under the safe home programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_6944">Any elderly emigrant for whom accommodation may be provided under the scheme is appraised by safe home of the date on which the accommodation will be available for occupation ensuring that accommodation is available to the emigrant on return. I understand that safe home also provides, where appropriate, a support service for elderly returning emigrants who are accommodated under the scheme. Where a need for this arises, it is provided on the emigrant's arrival in this country and for a period thereafter to ensure that returnees are able to cope with the change.</p>
          <p eId="para_6945">I also understand that safe home offers a service which includes the provision of information and practical advice to emigrants considering returning to this country including those emigrants arranging their own accommodation, irrespective of their intended destination. This service includes the provision of information in relation to entitlements in this country such as social welfare benefits, health services, housing etc.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_371">Safe home also provides information on benefits in the country of residence which a returning emigrant may have transferred with him or her on returning to this country. In addition, under the amended terms of the capital assistance  scheme, safe home acts in a co-ordinating role liaising with relevant individual voluntary housing bodies throughout the country in relation to accommodation for eligible elderly emigrants who are included in the safe home list.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_372">I am aware that safe home makes arrangements abroad to publicise the services provided by it, and I understand that safe home take care I advising potential returning emigrants to ensure that accommodation is available for them before returning.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_373">As safe home only arranges for the provision of accommodation for elderly emigrants under the amended terms of the capital assistance scheme, the question of those emigrants applying for inclusion on the local authority waiting lists should not arise.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6953">In July 2000, I approved a grant of €1.84 million to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cablecar and associated services between Inishbiggle and the mainland at Bullsmouth. This grant was based on a total estimated construction cost of €2.03 million with Mayo County Council to provide the balance of €0.19 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_6954">It was hoped construction of the cablecar would have commenced this year and that the service would be fully operational by the spring of 2003. However, an unforeseen delay was incurred as a result of an objection lodged with An Bord Pleanála last year against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of the land required for the project. While An Bord Pleanála subsequently confirmed the said compulsory purchase orders, this decision is currently the subject of a judicial review which, it is hoped, will be heard in the High Court early in the new year. The Deputy will appreciate that the project cannot be progressed any further until the judicial review process is completed.</p>

Given the tighter economic situation, we may not be in a position to progress the expansion of the community development projects at the same pace as we have done in previous years. In that context, it will be necessary to identify the priorities governing the allocation of funding to groups under the community development support programme. This process is currently at an early stage.

The NDST have also prepared guidelines for their operation in consultation the relevant sectors and agencies.</p>

The RDTFs will represent a team-based response to illicit drug use. It is my intention that all of the RDTFs members will work in partnership, in a manner similar to the local drugs task forces.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_6961">As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for overseeing the work of the local drugs task forces (LDTFs), which are based in the 14 areas of high drug misuse in Dublin including Tallaght, Cork and Bray. All of the LDTFs are currently implementing their second round plans and, to date, more than €14 million has been allocated to implement these plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_6962">Two projects specific to Travellers have received funding under the LDTF plans. Funding of €42,930 was provided for a Traveller support group in the Dublin north east LDTF area and funding of €41,067 was provided for a cross – task force project aimed at providing a culturally specific response to the problem of drug use in the Traveller community. The former project involved the employment of a youth worker to develop and deliver prevention and education programs to the traveller community in Dublin north east. The latter project is to develop an outreach, assessment, counselling and referral service for Travellers recruiting a worker with a view to linking clients into appropriate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_6963">This project will link with a Travellers drugs co-ordinator who was appointed under the first round of the LDTF plans. The post was subsequently mainstreamed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The health authority also sanctioned the appointment of a development worker to be part of this team.</p>
          <p eId="para_6964">The Deputy should also note that my Department manages and oversees the operation of the young people's facilities and services fund. The fund, which was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse, aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. The primary focus of the fund is on the 14 LDTF areas and the four urban centres of Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_378">To date, approximately €56 million has been allocated under round 1 of the fund to develop facilities and services in the above mentioned  areas. An amount of €37.5 million has been allocated for the development of facilities and the balance –€18.5 million has been allocated for the development of services. A total of €547,003 has been allocated to services projects aimed specifically at Travellers under round 1 of the fund.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_6966">The Government did not act on the recommendation of the Estimates review committee in relation to the Western Development Commission. It is well known that I have voiced concerns in the past regarding the structure and role of the Western Development Commission. This implied no criticism of members or staff of the commission. My concerns are based on my belief that there was no point in having a body whose role and funding is limited and that is working in a situation where all the other development agencies in the region continue to pursue, independent of the commission, their own policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_6967">Accordingly, in July I announced a review of the purpose, functional area and operation of the Western Development Commission in the context of the newly established Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with a view to bringing proposals to Government. The purpose of the review is to identify and eliminate any unnecessary duplication between State agencies operating in the western region, thus ensuring value for money of all public expenditure on promoting development in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_6968">The review, being undertaken by officials of my Department, is ongoing. It is expected that the review will be completed and its findings presented to me very shortly. I am satisfied that, despite the 10% reduction in the grant-in-aid for 2003 for general expenses, the commission will be able to operate effectively. While €1.5 million was provided in the 2002 Estimates, the actual requirement is only €1.413 million. The reason for the reduction in the allocation for the Western Investment Fund simply reflects the projected actual expenditure. Provision of €6.35 million was made in the 2002 Estimates. The reality, however, was that the likely drawdown would not exceed €1.35 million and this was based on information provided by the commission itself. It now transpires that the drawdown for this year will only be €1.157 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_6972">I propose to take Questions Nos. 392, 393 and 398 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_6973">This dispute arose, as the Deputies are aware, when the Irish Dental Association advised dentists to impose increased charges on patients in breach of their contracts under the scheme. The scheme continues to operate and patients continue to be treated by dentists who are prepared to operate in accordance with their contracts. Claims are not being accepted from dentists who were not prepared to adhere to the contractual arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_6974">My concern, throughout this dispute, is to ensure protection against full private fees for basic items of dental treatment under the scheme. Efforts to resolve the dispute are continuing, but so far it has not been possible to reach agreement on a mechanism which would afford the necessary level of protection for these workers. My officials are available for further discussion with the association to try and find a basis for resolution of the dispute. In the meantime, insured workers have been advised to check that their dentist is not imposing increased charges prior to starting treatment. They have also been advised that, where dentists offer to treat people as private patients, this is outside the terms of the dental benefit scheme and the Department will not be in a position to refund any costs arising.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_379">A locall service – 1890-400-400 – giving details of participating dentists is operating and is being heavily used. Callers are given the names of the dentists nearest to them still treating patients under the scheme. The dispute may cause some patients to seek treatment on a private basis and others to postpone it for the time being. It is not possible to assess the impact the dispute is having on claims under the scheme. However, expenditure under the scheme in the current year is expected to amount to €35 million, the same as  in 2001. The number of participating dentists changes from day to day. The expenditure figures suggest that those still participating are at present, in effect, making up most of the shortfall in treatments which might otherwise arise under the scheme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6976">Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Expenditure on diet supplements in the South-Western Area Health Board is running at €1,158,659 in 2002. There are 2,324 supplements in payment at present. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet – lower cost diets or higher cost diets – has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_6977">In the case of a lower cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is €34.28 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is €44.44 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_6978">However, increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1996, when the current arrangements were put in place, are disregarded for the purposes of this means test. All aspects of the diet supplement are being examined in conjunction with the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently under way in my Department. I have no immediate plans to amend any aspect of the diet supplement pending receipt of the review group's recommendations on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_6980">The bereavement grant is a payment  based on PRSI contributions. Where there are insufficient PRSI contributions a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under this arrangement, a health board may make a single payment to help meet once off exceptional expenditure, for example, for funeral expenses, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income. Any change to the bereavement grant scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_6982">Due to the continued decline in demand for the back to work allowance scheme and in the light of the recommendations of a review of labour market programmes, the qualification conditions for the scheme are being refocused on the most disadvantaged groups. This will mean that from January 2003, the scheme will be open to those who are very long-term unemployed, that is, on the live register for five years or more. Those in receipt of disability benefit for three years or more may also be eligible, as will those in receipt of one of the following for one year or more: disability allowance, invalidity pension, one parent family payment, carer's allowance, blind person's pension, ex-prisoners, pre-retirement allowance and unemployability supplement. Those who are currently on the back to work allowance scheme will not be affected by these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_6983">Following the publication of the Estimates volume for 2003, I also made a number of changes to social welfare schemes, including the back to education allowance scheme and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. There are no plans to abolish any of the schemes operated by my Department. As part of the budget 2003 package, I also announced improvements to other social welfare schemes including: improvements in the disregards for carer's allowance; removal of benefit and privilege assessment for unemployment assistance in respect of those aged 29 and over; extension of the free telephone allowance scheme to persons over 70 years in nursing homes where they have their own telephone account; extension of the islanders' allowance to people under 66 years in receipt of long-term disability payments, and increasing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by €30 in respect of children aged 12 years and over.</p>

          <p eId="para_6985">The person concerned applied for disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme on 14 May 2001. The basis for the application was that he had developed carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injury during the course of his employment as a chef. His application was refused on the grounds that he was not in a prescribed occupation for repetitive strain injury and that carpal tunnel syndrome is not a prescribed disease within the terms of the occupational injuries legislation. He subsequently appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. The appeals officer upheld the decision and disallowed the appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_6986">His contention that his claim should be allowed by reference to the information in the leaflet to which the Deputy refers was also examined. The medical evidence available to my Department was fully reviewed in this context but a revised decision was not warranted. He was advised accordingly. Following a review of the list of prescribed diseases and employments, the question of adding a number of diseases to the list of prescribed occupational diseases is being examined. Any change in this regard will be in the Social Welfare Bill, 2003. In the light of any changes in this regard, the person's entitlement to disablement benefit will be reviewed and he will be notified directly of the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_6987">He is currently in receipt of unemployment benefit. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</p>
