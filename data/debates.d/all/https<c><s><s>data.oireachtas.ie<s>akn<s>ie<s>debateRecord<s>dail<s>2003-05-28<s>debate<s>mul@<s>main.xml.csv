#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	0	This year Ireland will be the most expensive country in Europe. It is expensive across the board. In supermarkets, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, buses and trains the Irish consumer is being fleeced. VHI increases are up by 27% since 2001, ESB charges are up 13%, college registration fees are up 69% and so on. The blame for this lies at the door of the Government. It drove up inflation and is responsible for 60% of the inflation increase since 2002.The recent Forfás report recommended two central changes. It stated that the Government should set a credible inflation target for the year and that it should avoid increases in customs and excise duties, VAT and State-sponsored price increases such as education, health insurance and transport for the remainder of 2003 and 2004. Does the Taoiseach accept the findings of the Forfás report that the finger is pointed at the Government as being responsible for 60% of the inflation increase? Does he accept the central recommendations of the Forfás report that the Government should set a credible inflation target and avoid VAT and other State-sponsored stealth increases for the remainder of 2003 and 2004, and will he implement those recommendations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Forfás consumer pricing report and the National Competitiveness Council's statement on inflation, which were published last week, are matters of importance on which the Government has been working. We will continue to look at the recommendations and will continue our work on them. Inflation is falling – that is what the Minister stated at the start of the year. Our policies are designed to try to curb inflation in every way we can. The fall was in line with what the Minister said in the House last December about the strengthening of the euro, the fall in oil prices, the cuts in the ECB rates and hopefully the continuation of those cuts. There has been a cut of 0.75% since last December and the ease in services sector inflation, which was down by 2.5% in the last quarter, is helping.It is true, as Deputy Kenny says, that the indirect tax changes and increased administrative charges have impacted on inflation but not to the extent that he has said. These charges were necessary to fund the cost of providing services, which Members of the House every day seek, the extra €1 billion that we are spending on health and the large amounts of money that we are spending on education, the significant increases that we are spending across the board. Many people in the House would like us to spend more but they cannot have it both ways. At budget time it was estimated that indirect tax changes would add about 0.85% to the inflation rate but the estimate did not take account of subsequent administrative charges.To answer Deputy Kenny's last question on whether the Government is committed to trying to bring down inflation, I stated in a major address to the IMI conference a few months ago that over a period we hope to get inflation back to about 2% or 2.5%, that is, the euro average. That is the target the Government wants to achieve but it will not be done in a short time. However, we are committed to doing that and to doing as much as we can to drive down prices where there are large increases.Deputy Kenny mentioned drink and other sectors that show 30% of the rate outlined in the Forfás report, but as the House is aware this is always a dilemma. We tried to get agreement that items like cigarettes and drink are taken out of the CPI because we do not consider them to be essential household expenditure, but we were not able to get that agreement in the partnership talks. Even when we do not raise excise tax – we have followed that policy for the past six years – unfortunately prices are increased anyway and that creates the inflationary impact. It also has an effect on health and that is a dilemma with which we are continuing to deal, as has been discussed recently, but it is not an easy one to resolve. The Government is committed to trying to deal with the inflationary position as effectively and as fast as it can.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Taoiseach has given a long answer. Does he not accept that excise and other charges are six times greater in this country than in other European Union countries, that the CSO figures indicate that indirect taxes are responsible for a 1.4% increase in inflation and other charges are responsible for a 0.85% increase in inflation, making Government actions directly responsible for almost 2.5% of that increase? The Taoiseach says these charges were necessary, but that is so because of the Government's mismanagement of the public finances and the economy. If the running of the economy were based on penalty points the Government would already have lost its licence. Does the Taoiseach not accept that his record every week in government since he took up office has been to put 800 extra people on the register of unemployed persons? Does he accept that is an appalling record? The Taoiseach has said that the Groceries Order is not under review, but the Tánaiste said it is. Which is true? This is a matter of great concern to thousands of people.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Deputy Harney knows where I am going. I cannot believe that the Taoiseach can come in here and give an answer like that and suggest to Deputy Kenny that these charges, indirect taxes and stealth taxes were demanded by this side of the House, the implication being that they were to fund public services. The reason those charges were imposed in the last budget and that we have stealth taxes is because of the over-inflation of the economy during the boom, which has inevitably resulted in services inflation, and the Taoiseach knows that. He knows that the Government body, Forfás, has produced a year end report which shows that we are now the second highest priced economy in the eurozone. It shows inflation at 5.1% up to last February, as compared to a eurozone average of 2.3%. The Taoiseach knows that there are ordinary working families at home watching him waffle about the great job he is doing who know from the weekly shopping basket that they are the ones who are most seriously affected.I will give the Taoiseach an example. It is a while since we dealt with Duncan and Mary. They were Deputy McCreevy's creation in terms of how much they got out of the budget. This is what has happened to Duncan and Mary since. They are faced with the following additional expenses: €274 on college registration fees; €72 on ESB bills; €178 on VHI charges; €8.30 to visit an accident and emergency department; €30 to tax the car; €69.50 stamp duty on credit and ATM cards; €40 on gas bills; €43 on the TV licence; 1% VAT on fuel, hairdressing, cinema tickets and car repairs; and an extra €200 on prescriptions.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	47	At the risk of repeating myself, I have already said what the inflation rate is. I have already stated what the Government is trying to achieve. I have stated that we have created 300,000 jobs in the past five years. I have already stated that the Government is committed to maintaining, as we did in the previous budget, increases for those people in receipt of social welfare and those on fixed incomes. This year the Government was criticised by most economists on the basis that it gave pay increases that were above average. We did so because inflation was high and, therefore, we wanted to make sure we would protect the people about whom Deputy Rabbitte spoke. We also wanted to protect services.I say to Deputies Rabbitte, Kenny and other Members of the House that unfortunately one cannot have a position where one calls for the Government to follow policies that control the economic situation and then call every day for increased expenditure on this, that and the other.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	49	One cannot do that. The Government is determined in a difficult period – thankfully this has been agreed by the social partners, if Opposition parties do not adhere to it – to continue to have economic growth, to work towards low inflation, to continue to try, as we did in the past year, to increase employment by 1.5% and to try to maintain the unemployment rate as low as possible – it is still at an historically low rate of 4.6% in this very difficult climate, which is about four points below the European average. When we have had to make increases, we have kept figures as tight as possible – that is the reality – in order to generate the resources that were necessary for us to invest large increases in expenditure in health, social infrastructure and the welfare budget. We have continued to do that and at the same time we have not gone back to the old way of high borrowing. Any reasonable person would note that in a difficult international climate, we still have economic growth, are able to give sizeable increases—

In a very difficult year, the Government has put in a good performance in respect of all these targets and we will continue to do that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Does the Taoiseach recall that in 1997 when he inherited the economy on the cusp of a boom that the inflation figures under the then Finance Minister, Deputy Quinn, was 1.5%? How can he go on talking about increases in various benefits and so on when they have been eaten up by inflation. This is not Deputy Kenny and me advancing figures plucked out of the sky; this is what is stated in the Government's own year end report from Forfás – from the National Competitiveness Council. They are the ones who have concluded that not only are we the second highest priced economy in the eurozone, but that the Government is the main contributor.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	75	It is 30% at most.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	78	How can he say that with a straight face when inflation is at 4.3%? He made a speech in Killarney about services inflation and costs rising in the services industry as if he were an observer. What practical measures does the Government propose to take to deal with the inflationary crisis that will be seriously exacerbated by the hardening of the euro, that will have implications for jobs and that will make more people redundant before the end of the year, and all the time inflation is out of control?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Deputy Rabbitte will have noticed that the most recent consumer price index figure for last month indicated that the increase in inflation is 4.3%, which is a decrease of 0.6%, the largest in two and a half years. We will continue to pursue the policies of doing everything we can within what is prudent budget control to apply pressure wherever we can to reduce prices.I have already highlighted a number of the areas where Forfás believes Government action and control by the various State agencies can lead to a reduction in prices. Yesterday I answered questions on the legislation we will bring forward in the insurance area. We know that what has happened in recent years has placed enormous pressure on industry and prices and the Tánaiste has announced a range of proposals, among them the legislation I referred to yesterday.Deputy Rabbitte knows that we could have taken the approach in the recent pay talks of not giving satisfactory increases. We could have tried to renege on benchmarking, but we did not do that. In our view, public sector workers are entitled to their increases so we have honoured our commitments in benchmarking. We are paying higher pay rates than the eurozone in a number of areas and probably in excess of what we should be paying.We still believe we can reduce inflation, honour our pay commitments, cater for welfare increases, continue to create employment and honour commitments across the board. Some people said last year that we would return an enormous deficit, but we did not. Any fair analysis of the economy, and this is done by EUROSTAT, the European Central Bank, the IMF and OECD, shows that this country is managing itself much better in terms of growth, inflation, debt and all other aspects. Those are the facts.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I wish to put the Taoiseach's mind at rest in case he is concerned about running the risk of repeating himself.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	81	That is mostly as a result of listening to the Deputy.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Even he could not possibly remember the rigmarole he goes through every morning to avoid answering questions. Let us hope I have better luck.The United States Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, admitted yesterday that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They were destroyed before the invasion. This is the same person who revelled like a psychopath in his strategy of shock and awe as the entire infrastructure of a nation was blown to rubble by US and British bombs. This is the same person who, with President Bush, dictated that thousands of Iraqis would be slaughtered, children blown from their beds and civilians ripped to shreds by cluster bombs, allegedly because Iraq had weapons of mass destruction which posed a threat to the world.What does the Taoiseach say to this devastating admission and to a devastated Iraq and Ali Ismail Abbas, the 12 year old boy who moved the world as his limbs were battered by US bombs, allegedly to remove weapons of mass destruction? I ask this of the Taoiseach because the Government should give an explanation.On 20 March last the Taoiseach moved a motion in the House condemning the refusal of the Government of Iraq to comply with its obligations to disarm under numerous resolutions. Now we see that the motion and the speeches of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were moved on foot of a falsehood perpetrated by the United States Administration which the Taoiseach accepted. On foot of that falsehood, the Taoiseach facilitated the invasion of Iraq through the use of Shannon Airport.The Parliament and the people were misled. What will the Taoiseach do about it? Will he as a minimum ask the United States ambassador for an explanation? Will the Taoiseach demand an emergency United Nations discussion on the matter?

Whatever about what they will find ultimately or whatever history will say about the location of the weapons of mass destruction during last March, I make no apology for anything I said, especially given that 14,000 victims were killed in one village on one day by Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction.

Far from making the world safer, it makes it less stable. The Taoiseach did not answer my question. We will have to keep coming back to it and the Tánaiste may have to answer it.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The trouble is the same issue of dictatorship. The Deputy wants to dictate and wants me to accept it. He is selective about what dictator he follows. The reality is that the Government has supported the UN decisions and has supported its work throughout – and we played a significant role in it. We are glad to see the UN is back into position. UNMOVIC and IEA will, I hope, be back in Iraq in a short period of time. Let us be frank, any role we might have played was small, and we are not going to apologise for any small role we might have played in helping to remove a dictator who had made his people suffer for 20 years, carried out horrific acts and did not care about democracy or anything he did against his people. He is gone now and thank God for that.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.The bodies under the aegis of my Department are the National Statistics Board, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum, the Information Society Commission, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, the Law Reform Commission and the IFSC groups.The following are the changes that are in addition to those stated by me in the House on 11 March 2003. As chairman of the IFSC Banking and Treasury Group, Mr. Walter Brazil was appointed to the IFSC Clearing House Group. Mr. Michael Jackson was appointed to the IFSC Funds Working Group. Mr. John Goggin has been appointed to the IFSC Banking and Treasury Group. The terms of office of both the current NESF and NESC expired at the end of March 2003. They are now being reconstituted.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Is the Taoiseach aware of the concern and comment expressed by the public about prison visiting committees?

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Prison visiting committees are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I know that. However, they are State appointments. Half of them are either serving or former members of Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats. Does this not add to the general level of cynicism about these kind of appointments?In respect of the Aer Lingus board for instance, when the floatation of Telecom Éireann was mooted—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Again, this the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and I suggest the Deputy submit a question to the appropriate Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Does the Taoiseach accept that a number of persons on the Aer Lingus board have close links with the Fianna Fáil party and a review of this procedure is necessary to allow Aer Lingus to compete in the global aviation sector?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The Deputy is out of order. The questions are appropriate to the Minister responsible, not the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	131	What criteria does the Taoiseach use for these appointments in order to ensure that persons appointed to State boards are properly equipped to do the job expected of them?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The criteria are as follows. As chairman of the IFSC Banking and Treasury Group, Mr. Walter Brazil is one of the key individuals in the AIB capital markets division. All of the individuals on the boards under my domain are considerable experts. The National Statistics board is equally so. The National Economic and Social Council comprises five persons nominated by the agriculture and farming organisations, five nominated by the business and employer organisations, five persons nominated by the ICTU and five nominated by the community and voluntary sectors. The same applies to the National Economic and Social Forum. The members of the Information Society Commission are all experts in their roles and I can go through this if the Deputy wishes. It is an independent advisory body to Government. The members of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance are drawn from employers' organisations, unions, Government and some independent members. Members of the IFSC groups are drawn from people that are expert in the area, either in the IFSC insurance, banking and treasury, or clearing groups.Members of boards are of the highest order. I have hardly any say in picking them.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I am sure the Taoiseach would like to avoid the impression that appointments to State boards are any form of political payback. With regard to the appointments he has mentioned, does he see any merit in future appointment recommendations coming before the appropriate Oireachtas committee? This would allow the person to express interest and perhaps answer questions regarding the role they would have. Does the Taoiseach see this as beneficial to the overall confidence in which people hold State boards and appointments to them, which may be political in origin?Has the Taoiseach taken note of the failure to uphold the objectives of gender balance in appointments being made to State boards? The boards highlighted in the Women in Technology and Science study show the percentage of women on those boards dropped from 27% in 1997 to 25% in 2003.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	134	The question refers specifically to State boards and other agencies under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I am trying to stay in order. The area of gender balance is one in which the Taoiseach has expressed interest. For that reason, I hope he will take note of my question and recognise that there is a need for a more pro-active approach to this issue. Many State boards have no female members while many others have only one female member. There is clearly a need to make progress in this regard. What is the Taoiseach doing to lead this progress?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	136	With regard to the bodies under my aegis, I do all that I can to ensure the representation is kept to the fixed level, or higher if possible. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I do this at every opportunity. The most difficult thing is to try to get the nominating bodies to do this. In our legislation over the past 20 years we have given away the political power to nominating bodies as this is seen as the thing to do. Regardless of the group, the amount of effort used in trying to have nominating bodies nominate women is considerable. I would appreciate if nominating bodies put the same effort into this as do all governments.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I also asked a question about board members coming before committees.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I do not agree with bringing board members before committees. As I said yesterday, we find it difficult enough to bring legislation before committees, never mind establishing a Star Chamber such as that which operates in the United States where somebody is brought before a board and a crowd of backwoods people spend about a year trying to dig up something on the nominee to try to ridicule the nominee. I do not agree with this.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Is the Taoiseach saying Members are backwoodsmen?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Taoiseach should withdraw that comment.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I am glad to explain. What happens in the US, and it is well known, is that when someone is before a board people working for the political system spend an endless amount of effort in trying to get something to throw at the person so that they can have a Star Chamber that goes on for weeks. Most of the time they end up appointing the person anyway.

Is there any truth in the story in last week's Sunday Independent about sinecures being given to two former Cabinet colleagues on the Refugee Advisory Board? Was that story grounded in fact?

The Taoiseach has dealt with this matter in the House within the past 12 months. What further steps has he taken to ensure that a greater balance is achieved? Has he taken any new measures in order to address the difficulties he outlined before, and again this morning, in ensuring that these targets are met? Would it not be preferable that appointments to State boards be advertised? It would make sense to seek the people who are best qualified and have the necessary professional skills and particular interests, along with a proven record of involvement in the area of focus of said boards or agencies. That would enable the Government to avoid all the accusations of cronyism and political appointments and it might even eliminate the issue of backwoods people getting into State boards and agencies.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I have spoken to representatives of all the bodies with which I deal directly and asked them to ensure that when making nominations the 40% rule is, at a minimum, adhered to. I am not asking them to stick to the rule but to use it as a minimum guideline. In cases into which I have direct input I make sure that the number of women appointees is as high as possible.Whatever about the old system, in the vast majority of State boards it is becoming increasingly difficult to find eminent experts and people of high qualifications to serve on these boards, regardless of whether they are affiliated with a political party, although it is increasingly the case that they do not have any political affiliation. The boards are time-consuming and it costs most people a lot of money to serve on them. There are also all the other regulatory regimes. For the key boards – commercial and non-commercial semi-States – or any of the other expert boards, it is quite difficult to find people to serve, especially eminent people, from abroad or elsewhere. To ask them to advertise for people to come and give up their expert time to serve on a board, chair sub-committees and give an input would be entirely unrealistic. People would not do that and if I were them I would not either. More often than not, it is the case that either I or a Minister must ask people whether they will offer their services. I am talking about the main boards, not some of the ones that were mentioned. I am just telling the truth.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Deputy Stanton.

Is it not perhaps the case that the pool of people the Taoiseach is considering may be very limited in terms of the names that are known to the Taoiseach and his Department and those who are actually seeking candidates for these appointments? Is it not the case that by advertising, they could widen the pool? There is a great reserve of ability and knowledge and talent out there that has not been accessed. Could the Taoiseach not take that into account?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I will give the Deputy a list of some of these boards. I have already given the names of the social partnership boards, but even in those it is not easy to persuade trade union leaders and employer leaders to take on another board or another position. When it comes to the IFSC, we are talking about people from AIB Capital Markets, Bank of Ireland Securities, the Central Bank, the IDA, the Docklands, Merrill Lynch, Irish Permanent, the Revenue Commissioners, Aon Insurance, PricewaterhouseCoopers and the State Street insurance group. A great deal of searching must be done. Other than the people involved in the State, I do not know most of the people. It is the same with most of the State boards.There might be a limited number of people known to me, but even with the people one knows the job is not as it is made it out to be. I say this from my position, although other people have had this job in the past and will do so in the future. This issue keeps coming up, but nowadays it is hard work to persuade eminent people to serve on State boards. One might have to go down five or six people on the list because of the time commitments required – the appointee must serve on sub-committees and give up a lot of time. It is no plum job. Whatever small benefits an appointee might receive, he or she will be too busy ever to bother making use of them. Admittedly, I am not talking about prison visiting committees but about boards, but that is the reality. I respectfully suggest that Members should stop thinking it is an easy job because it is not.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Who draws up the lists of names for his perusal and final decision? He said himself that he had no say in this and very often does not know these people. What is the mechanism employed in selecting people for State boards? With regard to what the Taoiseach just said, we probably owe many of these people a debt of gratitude for giving of their time and expertise on many of these boards. Would the Taoiseach agree, however, that a certain amount of transparency is required? Much of this happens behind closed doors. It is often unknown to the public and to many Members that people are appointed to what are in many instances positions of great influence to make important decisions on behalf of the State. Will the Taoiseach consider ways of making the whole operation more transparent and more public?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I accept the Deputy's point; it is not a totally transparent system. I can speak best about the bodies I deal with. In the National Statistics Board, these positions only go to a handful of people, mainly university people. As the Deputy said, they give enormously of their time and expertise. The chairperson of that board has now been there for ten years under successive Governments. They give up an enormous part of their lives, never mind their working lives. When it comes to the NESC and the NESF, I go to IBEC, the Irish Council of Trade Unions and the farming bodies and ask them to nominate people. I accept their names without question. That is what happens.On the Information Society Commission, we request the groups in the software society to provide us with names. I am not saying every person is picked in that way, they are not. Because of the burdens now placed on boards, chairpersons, even in ministerial political appointments, make it abundantly clear they do not wish to have unsuitable people on their boards, and if such a person is appointed they make sure it does not happen again. Ministers should not appoint people who wish only to sit around the table and not become involved. That is the way things are moving and appointments will, increasingly, be made in that way.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Having once been nominated by the Taoiseach to the National Economic and Social Council, I accept much of what he says in relation to his room for manoeuvre in nominations to boards within his own Department. Will he accept that the current system brings about a small gene pool from which to select? Very often, particularly among the social partners, one finds individuals who are members of more than one body in the social partnership process. There is a need to broaden the process through advertising or the establishment of a public appointments commission that would mirror the local appointments commission. We need to open up this process so that as many people as possible know what is available in terms of public service positions and how to go about filling them.On Deputy Sargent's question, will the Taoiseach consider, at the very least, a suitable adaptation of Standing Orders of Dáil committees to allow for some form of questioning by the chairpersons of nominated public bodies to ensure we know at least the background of the individuals concerned and the strategic vision they have in the roles they are asked to perform? That would be an excellent role for the committees of this House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I am not unreasonable in such matters. Deputy Boyle is correct in saying that sometimes individuals end up as members of a number of committees. It is hard to ensure that does not happen. I am against being overly bureaucratic, I would rather matters are settled in a more meaningful way. I am in favour of a number of people becoming involved. I have tried to do so in regard to financial services boards where I have asked that they not put forward people from the same companies but should try to involve new people. I am not against exploring how we can broaden this area.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	178	The asset management task force was established in late 2001 to examine the recommendations of a report produced by the IFSC funds working group on opportunities for a broader-based institutional asset management business in Ireland. The task force and working group operate under the aegis of my Department.The report of the asset management task force was published in May 2002. In it, the task force makes a number of recommendations in the areas of education, regulation and marketing. The recommendations are designed to increase the opportunities for the asset management business in Ireland. Since publication of the report, the task force has continued to exist to progress the recommendations.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	179	What impact is being given to the implementation of the recommendations that might be accepted? What is being done to strengthen undergraduate, postgraduate training in asset management, particularly in relation to the chartered financial analyst, CFA, programme which was specifically highlighted in the task force report?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Deputy Kenny is correct. Asset management is big business and it provides enormous opportunities throughout the world. Business, globally, is now in excess of $35 trillion with more than 5,000 people directly involved in financial services involved in the asset management business. We are now faced with the huge task of holding and continuing to grow this business. Some €240 billion of current Financial Services Centre business is under asset management.The Society of Investment Analysts in Ireland wanted to engage with the educational institutions to assist in ensuring their programmes take account of up-to-date practice in the asset management industry and to ensure they have, every year, graduates coming on board who can work in this area. The certified financial management degree, the postgraduate degree referred to by Deputy Kenny, has been developed between the industry and the Society of Investment Analysts in Ireland and they have agreed a curriculum. They have also agreed a research programme with a number of universities and third level institutions to investigate, after two years, the impact of the increased number of students who studied for the certified financial analysis qualification. The report was undertaken to ensure that not alone did they obtain graduates but that they obtained ones qualified in international bodies. The courses have been established and are operational. We hope this will enable us to maintain the enormous business we have.This is a competitive area and if we do not stay ahead, other financial centres will take over. Competition between the financial centres for this business is ongoing. We have €240 billion under asset management. That is a great deal of money but the market in this area was $33 trillion five years ago. It is an enormously lucrative area but one cannot get the business unless one has people qualified in this area.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Do I understand from what the Taoiseach said that the purpose of the task force was to ensure the provision of young people with the skills to work in this industry? Was the regulatory aspect of the role of the task force to ensure best practice operates in the industry? Has the graph continued to rise since the slowing down of the economy?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Indications in recent years are that competition in this area and our overall management of assets is increasing. I do not think it has risen much in this area but it has managed to maintain its position. The task force dealt with the regulatory issue which feeds into IFSRA There must be tight regulation in this area. The Central Bank is on top of the issue. One needs staff and the task force has, in its report, developed numerous marketing initiatives which were discussed this week by the Central Clearing House. The Central Clearing House is chaired by the Secretary to Government. Other clearing houses deal with issues such as insurance and so on.Asset management is big business – I said earlier it was approximately $33 trillion at 1999 levels – and is good for employment. Other financial centres are far more aggressive than us in their marketing of it. I have stated that the Government should participate and work with the industry to try to cut a slice of the market. I do not think the Government should pay for the marketing – it is a lucrative business – but it should get involved. My Luxembourg colleague takes a very aggressive approach to marketing it and to the way they use the state in it. We should help, but I do not think we should pay for it.It is a very good employer. Of the 11,000 people in the IFSC, 5,000 are directly involved in this.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Are specific courses being designed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Yes, special degree courses have been developed for graduate and postgraduate studies and a number of universities have taken up the courses.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	185	As somebody who has worked in a business school in the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Taoiseach's alma mater, I know this is an important outlet for graduate employment. Is the Taoiseach aware that the qualification level which is being expected in this area is a masters degree? I do not want to reopen the debate that his colleague had over the fees; he knows my views on it. For many people of modest means, accessing and funding a masters programme in one of the top business schools in Dublin is fairly expensive. One is talking about substantial fees which are in the order of those given in The Irish Times.We are losing quite a number of good graduates. At present, quite a number of them are going abroad because they are getting offers of taught masters in places like the London School of Economics at very competitive rates compared to the rates here, and they are then often lost to our industry.Therefore, it is an adjunct to the whole debate. If the Taoiseach wants highly qualified people in this country, does he agree that there should be more consideration given to how he might assist people who need to do masters and post-qualification programmes, either in accounting or finance, to qualify for these jobs and to be employed at senior levels ultimately?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	186	On the fee levels which have been put out for this, it costs €2,500 to sit the CFA exams – between tuition, books and fees. That is what the industry tells me. Some 165 people sat the various levels of the examination this year. Therefore, we are picking up the numbers.I have no argument with what Deputy Burton stated about the levels but if one has been a good asset manager, one is qualified to a great extent as regards the basic degrees. They then go on to see the figures.I was reading these questions last night. The Deputy is right in saying that we are losing people, but they are taking €250,000 plus fringe benefits at 26 or 27 years of age. It is a competitive business. The overall package is €350,000. It is enormous money for our sectors of the industry. It is a question of the more we can qualify and the more the banks can put in. They are obviously not paying those kinds of salaries unless there is a good profit margin in it. What I have been doing is trying to press the colleges here to get our bright young people into these areas. The banks should be paying their fees.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I agree.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	188	They should be paying their fees and then getting some deal that they stay so many years. I look in awe at people of 27 and 28 if they can walk out and get packages of €250,000 or €350,000. The only way we can deal with it is by getting more of them through the system. We should do anything we can to get more of them through the system because obviously they are highly thought of. Apparently Irish graduates are more sought after than many other nationalities, which is good. Nobody in this game is on less than €150,000, from what I can see.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Taoiseach's last comment is particularly apt, given the question I want to put to him, because he used the words "this game". There is a sense that there is a game being played in this area. Is part of the remit of the task force to address what I would call required checks and balances regarding the activities of asset management, given that invariably and often – not only in the Irish experience but also internationally – in some cases much of the reported successes are based on notional values rather than on real asset improvement? We have seen all of the difficulties associated with dealers in international situations which have had effects on asset management here at home. Could the Taoiseach give us some assurances that checks and balances are being prescribed as a result of the work of the task force?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Yes. Obviously not everybody in the business is doing tremendously well. It is only those at the top who can get the high salaries. Many others come in at normal salaries, which are fairly high in financial institutions anyway. Depending on how the international economy is faring, many of the people would not be getting those salaries. It is the people at the top end, who are obviously crucial to a business, who can command high salaries.To assure the Deputy on the regulatory side of it, the task force has continued to meet to consider the recommendations contained in the report. The task force has representatives from my own Department, other Departments and agencies to facilitate a potential increase in the number of students for the CFA programme. That is how we can make sure that we have enough people in the business here and can grow the business here, and also keep the salaries at realistic levels and not lose them to financial services outside Ireland. They are also co-ordinating their discussions between the influential international body, the Association for Investment Management and Research and Irish universities. The report also deals with marketing which is a key objective for them.I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that the regulatory aspect of this is very tight. The Central Bank, in all of this, will provide an effective focus on matters of concern to consumers and retailers. It will have a dedicated consumer director. A new structure will facilitate continued effective co-operation between the regulators and those charged with monetary management. There is also international co-operation. The IFSRA is the new board which is the overall regulatory body. It was launched on 1 May and is dealing with the issues to which Deputy Ó Caoláin referred – the regulatory and control issues.The report was trying to regulate its own industry to have sufficient people, who then would have normal salaries, in order that we would not be losing people to such an extent because it is only people at the very high levels who will be coaxed away by high salaries. However, it is a well-regulated area. There is enormous money involved – they now deal with trillions, not millions or billions.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.Responsibility for internal national security is a matter for the Garda Síochána, with support as appropriate from the Defence Forces.The National Security Committee comprises representatives of those agencies at the highest level and of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence and Foreign Affairs and is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government. It is concerned with ensuring that I and the Government are advised of high level security issues and the responses to them, but not involving operational security issues.It would not be appropriate to give detailed information about meetings of the committee, but it meets regularly as required and members liaise on an ongoing basis. It is continuing to monitor developments which might have security implications, in particular, developments in the international arena.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I note that the head of MI5, Ms Eliza Manningham-Buller, and the head of the CIA met recently in London following remarks made by the reputed deputy leader of al-Qaeda urging Muslims to attack British and American missions. In that context, is the Taoiseach concerned that the increased expenditure on security arrangements at Sellafield have been reported to him? BNFL has stated that it has increased defence and security measures there. Is the Taoiseach happy that that is the case and has he raised that with Prime Minister Blair?Some time ago the Minister for Defence admitted in the House that in the event of a terrorist attack or an attack on an international facility here by outside forces, the only recourse the Government would have would be to seek outside help. Have arrangements been put in place if that unfortunate event were to ever take place? For instance, is the Taoiseach happy with a situation where the Minister for Defence needs 2,000 extra nuclear/biological suits for the Army and can only supply 50% of them?Is that situation really up to scratch internationally in today's terms? Is the Taoiseach happy that the 25 proscribed terrorist organisations in Britain and the 14 in Northern Ireland are being monitored in so far as is possible in terms of their implications for the 26 counties?

I will allow a brief question from Deputy Sargent. When I say a brief question, Deputy, there is no use asking five or six questions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	197	When the Ceann Comhairle stops talking, I will ask the brief question.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	201	On foot of Deputy Kenny's question, does the Taoiseach agree that given our proximity, the Irish Government should have the same visiting entitlements to installations such as Sellafield as has the International Atomic Energy Agency. If we are to prevent terrorism, it is important to insist on parity of access to information rather than being drip-fed what the international agency, or the British Government tells us.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Some of the questions asked are for the Minister for Defence because they relate to the office of emergency planning and the co-ordination by that office of the work of the emergency services in the preparation of contingency plans. The task force on emergency planning is chaired by the Minister for Defence and meets frequently to assist on these issues. The high level group in my Department co-ordinates the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Foreign Affairs, the Army and the Garda Síochána in order that intelligence information, which is normally extremely sensitive, can be collectively discussed.Deputies Kenny and Sargent asked about BFNL. I have taken up that issue directly with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on a number of occasions. I have written to him extensively on this issue taking into account the views of agencies here. The next round of the action on this matter will occur shortly. We continue to explore the legal issues so I do not wish to say anything further as it will be part of our case. We are continuing to highlight our case which the Attorney General will present shortly.On the issue of biometrics, it is clear that the United States is continuing to use biometrics which is the new intelligence. It will increasingly be used as a security measure and will become a feature of life. The world congress of biometrics will be held here in the near future. I have been reading some of the newspapers and it is quite clear what has happened.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	368	This morning I received a letter from a young boy who has returned from Calcutta, which was very uplifting and has prompted me to ask a question on the Order of Business. The Taoiseach will be aware that Mr. David Begg chaired an advisory group on EU Presidency priorities for the Committee on European Affairs, concerning Third World indebtedness, AIDS and other issues. In view of the fact that President Bush is proposing to make available $15 billion to tackle AIDS over the next five years, will the Taoiseach consider making time available to debate the advisory group's report here, perhaps on a Friday morning, in order to try to get these issues on the agenda of Ireland's EU Presidency as well as moving them higher up the EU agenda?

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The report—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I am sorry, Deputy, but the Chair has ruled, as have my predecessors, that it is not appropriate to ask for debating time on the Order of Business.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I see the Taoiseach indicating that he agrees with this.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	373	It is a matter that affects millions of lives.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	374	There is a long-standing ruling of the Chair that a Deputy requesting the Government to make a statement or allow a debate on a matter should not raise that matter on the Order of Business. Otherwise, every issue would be raised and Standing Order 26, providing for the Order of Business, would be null and void.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	375	This is a matter of great importance and the Taoiseach is willing to have it discussed.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The Deputy has a way of raising the matter; a request for a debate on promised business can be allowed if, for example, it has been promised in an earlier exchange in the House during Leaders' Questions or ordinary parliamentary Question Time. If Members listened to the Standing Orders, they would be aware of them when the time arises. If a debate has been promised, it is in order to ask when the debate will take place. If a debate has not been promised, then it is not in order to raise it on the Order of Business. That is a long-standing rule of my predecessors and myself.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I apologise, a Cheann Comhairle, for troubling the House with issues such as AIDS, hunger and indebtedness, when there are people here raising issues like bus stops.

Three years ago a Government commission recommended legislation to give them some minimal legal rights. The publication of that legislation was promised before Christmas, then before Easter and, most recently, before the end of this month. On which of the three remaining days in this month will the legislation be published in line with the most recent promise we had about its publication?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	393	We have had a public inquiry about this as well as a vote of the City Council, based on certain undertakings given by the Minister—

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Now those undertakings are being changed. A democratic vote must be taken if the tolling arrangement is to be changed and the ownership of the tunnel is to be changed.

When will that debate take place, given that two of the reports are currently available to the Government and another is pending?Yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced a raft of legislation and I presume when he announces it outside the House, it is thereby promised. When this legislation is being taken, the Opposition has a duty to parse, examine and maybe oppose or support some of it. May I ask that the two week rule be observed whereby Members of the Opposition who have to deal with the legislation will have it two weeks in advance of its being taken in the House? There are four weeks in the next term. Given that the Minister said it will be taken during that term, can we have the legislation at an early date so that the Opposition will have a fair chance of dealing with it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I will raise that issue.

I understand he was ready to move the heads of the Bill to the committee almost immediately, to use that as part of the discussions while the legislation is in preparation and to try to get the legislation through before the summer. It will be tight but the Government would like to get the legislation through before the summer.

These include the National Monuments Bill and the Heritage Powers and Functions Bill which relates to heritage by-laws. Will the Taoiseach indicate which Minister will introduce the Bills? The first Bill is very important. Under the proposed legislation, national monuments will lose the services of a professional archaeologist.

Given that significant contents of two of the reports have become known to the public, and assuming we will have the debate before the House rises for the long summer recess, will he now revise his opinion and decision and forthwith publish the two existing reports currently in the possession of the Government? This would enable members of the Opposition to study them in order that they would be equally informed and could contribute to the debate on an equal footing with the Government which already has the reports. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the debate will take place and that it will be of some merit because we will have time to study the reports in advance?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	448	It is the Government's intention to publish the reports.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The purpose of this Bill is to establish the National and Economic Social Development Office and, through it, give a statutory basis to its constituent bodies, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provided that the NESC, the NESF and the NCPP would be brought together within the National Economic and Social Development Office, and the Bill puts this commitment on a statutory basis.Before dealing with the Bill, it is worth considering the social and economic climate in which it has been introduced. On the domestic front, economic growth has slowed this year, primarily as a consequence of the international downturn in continental Europe as well as the United States. Nevertheless, growth here is the strongest in the European Union, thereby continuing a pattern that has been evident for a sustained period. In relative terms, therefore, Ireland's overall economic performance remains impressive. It demonstrates a well developed resilience to offset the worst potential effects of sudden and persistent external shocks or downturns.That said, one should not ignore the pressure points that currently exist. For example, the Exchequer situation has changed, which has implications both in terms of the choices at our disposal and the options that can be pursued. That was evident in the economic circumstances in which the recent discussions with the social partners took place. What we must do, first and foremost, is keep expectations and demands in line with fiscal conditions and outlooks. If we do that, competitiveness will be protected and employment secured. If we do not, the consequences are self-evident from our economic past, most notably the early and middle 1980s.However, it must also be borne in mind the Government debt-GDP ratio is such that it has fallen from 65% at the end of 1997 to an estimated 34% at the end of last year. This means that, with the exception of Luxembourg, we have the lowest debt-GDP ratio in the European Union. On the inflation front there are indications that pressures are easing, but it is clear that continued diligence is required.I addressed some of these issues in my recent speech to the IMI conference. I stressed that the issue of competitiveness is absolutely basic and that unless we are competitive, the economy will not thrive. The present situation holds some vulnerabilities. There is no doubt that we have lost some competitive ground through increased operating costs and slower productivity growth. It is vital, therefore, to underpin development efforts with a more competitive cost base.The framework for injecting the necessary diligence, stability and certainty into economic and social policies has been social partnership. Born out of the serious fiscal crisis in the middle 1980s, it crystallised in 1987 in the form of the Programme for National Recovery, an agreed consensus between the Government, trade unions, business organisations and farming bodies on the tasks to be faced and the actions to be pursued. That first agreement has been succeeded by further agreements that have encompassed a wider economic and social agenda, focusing on such issues as unemployment, inequality and social exclusion as well as incomes policy.The shared overall goal of the new agreement, Sustaining Progress, covering the period 2002 to 2005, is to continue progress towards the realisations of the NESC vision for Irish society in terms of economic inclusion based on full employment, consistent economic development that is socially and environmentally sustainable, social inclusion and a commitment to social justice and continuing adoption to change. This goal is in the context of the more medium-term goals set out in the recent NESC strategy report. It also reflects the reality of the fiscal environment, whereby current resource constraints have implications for priorities and timeframes across all policy areas and programmes. That is why the recently ratified social partnership agreement is so important. It promises stability in what will undoubtedly be an unpredictable economic environment and it will help to ensure that we maintain the industrial harmony that has characterised the economy over the past years.I acknowledged the considerable effort and commitment by all those involved in the successful negotiations on Sustaining Progress. The series of agreements since 1987 have played a very significant role in the radical transformation of the country's economic and social fortunes. The social partnership process has engineered an unprecedented consistency across a range of policy areas, whether of a fiscal, monetary, social or equality nature. We cannot afford, however, to rest on past achievements although from time to time it can appear that familiarity with the social dialogue process leads us to undervalue it.We know that we must keep striving for competitiveness in a fast changing world. We also know that while the products of economic growth are evident, for many people poverty remains a reality and deprivation a way of life. This reality presents an even greater challenge in an environment where growth has slowed down and the available resources must be managed in a more targeted and effective manner.As a society we jointly face the challenge of securing our future well-being. By working together, the Government and the social partners have overcome major challenges, such as putting the public finances in order and successfully tackling unemployment. The issues confronting us today, whether in terms of competitiveness, social cohesion, environmental sustainability, agricultural change or financial market volatility, are no less complex and challenging and require a similar collective response.As I have repeated on a number of occasions, there is a clear choice. We can choose between planning and working together or pursuing sectional interests, as we did at times before the social partnership agreements. Social partnership has demonstrated a strong capacity for adopting and evolving a response to current needs and concerns. It is the hope of the Government that with the successful outcome of Sustaining Progress, partnership will continue into the future.The new office, the National Economic and Social Development Office, to be established by this legislation, is a framework to provide a statutory basis for the work of three separate bodies within the fabric of social partnership. The National Economic and Social Council was established in 1973 as an advisory body to the Government on the development of a national economy and the achievement of social justice. In this, its 30th anniversary year, the council continues to provide a forum in which views can be exchanged between those who have a common interest in the development of the economy and the pursuit of social justice.The membership of the NESC is representative of the major economic and social interests in our society and that broad spectrum of talent has enabled the council to undertake innovative and pioneering work in a number of areas. In particular, its strategy reports have provided the framework for the negotiations of the national agreements between the Government and the social partners since 1987. The most recent strategy document provided the backdrop to the discussions on the recent talk on social partnership.The National Economic and Social Forum was originally set up by the Government in 1993 for the purposes of widening the social partnership process and of achieving consensus on as wide a base as possible on major economic and social policy issues. Since 1998, the forum's work has been focused on evaluating the implementation of policies dealing with equality and social inclusion. In that period it has produced a number of reports which have drawn on the experience of a wide range of interests, especially the consumers of public services.The third strand feeding into this National Economic and Social Development Office is the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, the NCCP. Launched in 2001 its purpose is to support and drive change in the work place. It will enable organisations in the private and public sectors, through partnership, to respond to change, to build capability and to improve performance. The NCCP has a mission to support and facilitate organisational change based on partnership to bring about improved performance and mutual gains. This contributes to national competitiveness, better public services, higher living standards, a better quality of work life and the development of the work place in the future.The centre is practical in its approach. In addition to disseminating evidence and experience-based information on how partnership and change can contribute to productivity and competitiveness, it will also directly assist and support significant partnership initiatives. I commend the work of these three bodies and the major contribution made over the years by their members, including Members of this House and their excellent staff.These are the distinct bodies that have been brought together to operate within the National Economic and Social Development Office. The roles of each body, however, are distinct yet complementary. This legislation will give statutory recognition to the important role of these partnership institutions, confirm their independence and provide a proper basis for the recruitment and employment of staff. The office will act as a resource base for the Government's advisory bodies on economic and social policy and partnership. Their co-operation with each other within the office will create the positive synergies that the Government believes are necessary in this area.I will now deal with the Bill and its provisions. The Bill deals with the practical arrangements for the establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office and for the benefit of the House I will touch on some of its main features. Section 6 sets out the establishment of the office and refers to its constituent parts as including the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. It also states that the office in each body established under this section and section 7 shall have all such powers as are necessary for, or incidental to, the performance and functions under this Act.In the interest of providing flexibility to address issues that may arise in the future, section 7 gives the Taoiseach the power, following consultation with the Minister for Finance and any other Minister, to establish by order any additional body within the office as considered appropriate to prepare advice and reports on any aspect of any matter regarding the functions of the office.Section 8 states that the function of the office shall be to advise the Taoiseach on all strategic matters relevant to economic and social development in the State. It will do so by supporting the individual mandates of NESC, NESF and NCPP as set out in their own terms of reference, in particular by making the relevant staff available.The functions of the council, the forum and the centre are set out in sections 9 to 11, respectively. The functions of the council shall be to analyse and report to the Taoiseach on strategic issues relating to the efficient development of the economy, the achievement of social justice and the development of a strategic framework for the conduct of relations and negotiations of agreement between the Government and the social partners. The functions of the forum are to monitor and analyse the implementation of specific measures and programmes identified in the context of social partnership, especially those concerned with the achievement of equality and social inclusion, a new function which will be reflected by a Government amendment in due course and to facilitate public consultation on policy matters referred to it by the Government from time to time. The functions of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance shall be to support and facilitate organisational change and innovation based on partnership in order to bring about improved performance and mutual gains and to contribute to national competitiveness, better public services, higher living standards, a better quality of life and the future development of the work place.Section 13 sets out the composition of the office as being the chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of the council, the forum and the centre. Sections 14 to 16 explain the nominating procedures for the ordinary membership of each of the bodies. In all cases the members shall be appointed by the Taoiseach. Section 17 sets out the term of office of the chairperson and the ordinary member of any new body within the office and the conditions under which both will hold office. The section also calls for an equitable balance to be achieved between men and women in the composition of a body.Section 19 outlines the conditions which apply to a member of the council, the forum, the centre, or a member of the staff of the bodies when they are nominated or elected to membership of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament and thereupon cease to be a member or a member of staff of the particular body.Sections 20 to 22 cover the establishment of committees and how they will function, the disclosure by members of the office, body and staff, of interests, and the prohibition on the disclosure of confidential information. Section 23 deals with the role of the chief officer of the office and indicates the duties assigned to him or her, the method of his or her appointment and removal by the Taoiseach and other conditions which apply to the post. Section 25 is about the staff of the office and how such staff are to be recruited. This will require consultation between the office and the director of the body concerned and must have the consent of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. It also deals with the removal of any officer or employee who fails to perform his or her functions satisfactorily.Sections 28, 30 and 31 cover the financial arrangements for the office and in particular the advancing to the office of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, and keeping of accounts and the conditions which apply to their submission to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The provision for the giving of evidence by the chief officer to the Dáil committee established to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriate accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General is also covered. Section 33 requires the office to report to the Taoiseach at the end of the financial year and the Taoiseach shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The office shall be required under section 32 to prepare a strategic plan for approval by the Taoiseach not later than six months after the establishment day of the office and every three years from the submission of the first statement. Once approved, a copy of the plan will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In the interest of providing flexibility to cope with future developments while providing the benefit of a statutory body, section 34 allows the Taoiseach the right to dissolve the council, the forum, the centre and any other body established under section 7, following consultation with the office and any Minister who is represented on the body. The office will be included in the First Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and thereby will be covered by its provisions. Section 35 sets this out.The remaining sections of the Bill are to do with the dissolution of the existing non-statutory council, forum and centre on the establishment day of the new office, the transfer of rights and liabilities of the dissolved bodies, the drawing up of the accounts of the dissolved bodies, and of particular importance to the staff of the bodies, the conditions which apply to the transfer of the new statutory bodies. The Bill will put in place the structures referred to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness by combining the NCCP alongside the NESC and the NESF to ensure that their complementary roles are acknowledged and developed to support the economic and social fabric of our society. I am confident that the new office will achieve this and I wish it well in its important work. I commend this Bill to the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	489	This Bill will put a statutory foundation on the National Economic and Social Development Office which comprises three bodies, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, which are inextricably linked and underpin the social partnership process. The Bill is welcome in so far as it will provide some element of accountability to the Dáil. It is also to be welcomed that the practical arrangements for the establishment of the office, its functions, composition and membership, the nomination procedures and the terms of office of office holders will now be on a basis which is consistent with other statutory bodies. In that context, like the Taoiseach, I wish to thank all of those who contributed in any way to the valuable work of the committees, the reports they have produced over the years and the valuable information that was brought to light as a consequence.It is, however, timely that when we are debating this Bill we should look at the process which the National Economic and Social Development Office has been established to underpin. It is not before time that social partnership was the subject of some searching analysis. The present structure of social partnership was precipitated by the economic disasters of the 1980s, when unemployment had reached 17.5 %. In five years emigration totalled 160,000 people, most of them young. Ireland was seen as a basket case with a debt ratio of 125% of GNP.  Destructive conflicts between vested interests was feeding a wage price spiral in which everybody lost. Social partnership was founded on the realisation by key vested interests that a co-operative approach could yield better results. There was also a unifying vision of job creation in whose interests other demands would also be set aside.The ingredients of the initial social partnership centres were quite simple: low "one size fits all" wage settlements; clear commitments to reduce tax; absolute priority for employment growth in all areas of policy; and avoiding sharply defined policies that might upset consensus. It is arguable that the model has paid dividends in supporting a policy of rapid employment growth, accompanied by real improvements in take home pay. It also gave a substantial influence over public policy to the social partners.Surely now, nearly a decade and a half on from the first agreement of this type, it is time for us to look hard at this model. Many of the limitations of this model of partnership are being exposed. Before the current agreement, Sustaining Progress, was negotiated, there was very little questioning of its continued relevance. The failure to question the current model is one which we all share. Opposition parties like my own which should have been challenging conventional wisdom instead genuflected to the holy grail of consensus.The world we live in today is very different from the world in which social partnership was conceived and reared. While we are seeing an increase in unemployment with more regular announcements of job losses, there is no enormous pool of Irish workers seeking employment. The traditional source of workers, unemployed people, returning immigrants and rising female participation, is drying up. The capacity for tax cutting has been exhausted if we wish to maintain a decent standard of public service. What we have seen from the Government is a range of stealth taxes which it is using to replenish the coffers which it has so wastefully emptied in recent years. The problems facing society now are more complex and challenging and they highlight the limitations of consensus policies. Consensus in a way is like being wrapped in cotton wool. Initially, it provides a warm glow, but ultimately it can suffocate politics and stifle the capacity of our society to confront new problems in a new way.Many individual business people and working people have commented to me that at times they feel the social partnership agreements are more about the officials who represent IBEC and ICTU than they are about the members of those bodies and their real needs. Even on the wage front, the limitations of partnership have been exposed. Technology has transformed jobs that people do, but frozen wage relativity policies are hampering adjustment.The benchmarking process, which should have been an open and transparent process for dealing with some of these problems with the public sector, was shrouded in secrecy. The report provided no detail about the job comparisons between the public and private sectors used to calculate the recommended increases. Given the extent of the bill being imposed on the taxpayer, ranging from between €1.2 billion to €1.3 billion, this lack of transparency was extraordinary and it left unanswered many legitimate questions about the rationale for the increases and has left public servants who are to receive lower increases very disgruntled. Better pay for public servants must translate into better service for the public. However, in the recent agreement, the Government put dates on the payments before negotiating the modernisation programme which the payment is meant to bring about. The limitations of the current partnership type agreement in wider spheres of policy are becoming even more obvious. It has given priority to the interest of producers over consumers, slowed down the pace of serious public sector service reform, shelved genuine devolution of power; distorted reform in key markets and blunted social accountability.The partnership process has supported a position where the interests of producers have taken precedence over the interests of consumers. This is clearly the case in private sector bastions like banking and insurance. It is equally true in the public service, in public utilities like transport as well as services like health and education. As I pointed out this morning, the Forfás report pointed the finger of guilt and blame directly at Government and said that as a majority shareholder Government is responsible for significant increases in the inflation rate and inflationary conditions in the country. It set out two specific recommendations that Government should follow. The first of these is that Government should set a credible inflation target and thereafter should avoid increases in customs and excise duties, VAT and State sponsored price increases such as in education, health insurance and transport for the remainder of 2003 and 2004. If, as the Taoiseach said, we need increased value in public services, these are two recommendations made by a competent body to Government with which it should deal.Serious efforts to benchmark our public service against best practice have been blunted by the partnership model. In recent years, we have seen a massive expansion in the number of persons employed in the public service, particularly in health, but we are not seeing a commensurate improvement in the delivery to patients. Last week's waiting list figures are an example of this, as are other figures indicating employment of unauthorised personnel and an obscene waste of money in other areas. While much lip service is paid to it, accountability remains a taboo subject to many in the public service. This not only undermines consumer interests, but it militates against the opportunities of genuine professional development in the longer term.There are many within the public service who want to see the poor performance exposed and tackled and who want to see those who perform well properly rewarded, but the social partnership model we have used has hindered rather than helped to achieve that. Genuine devolution of power has been side-stepped continuously. Instead of reforming the big bureaucracies by devolving power and responsibility, the partnership process has developed new layers of partnership institutions. Some of these operate to good effect, but with limited budgets.Partnership has also failed to give us reform of key markets. The model of privatisation which has developed has been flawed. In the current model, the general taxpayer hands over, free of charge, valuable shares to workers currently serving in the company. It ignores the contributions of pensioners who built up the asset over many years. Public interest gets scant attention. Ireland's loss of ground in the competitiveness of our telecommunications infrastructure is in no small part due to an ill-considered model of privatisation. It has now resulted in this key and national infrastructure being in the hands of companies which have expensive capital to repay and very little capacity to develop the infrastructure.Competition in areas like public transport has been shunted into a siding, all in the name of partnership. The canvass of traditional partnership is built around the triangle of wages, employment and profits. This neglects many areas of policy that impact on the lives of our citizens.Employers' responsibility to parents has been neglected. The crazy pattern of developer-led construction policies has put many lives on impossible treadmills. I am reminded of a woman in Lucan who spoke at a public meeting recently. She said that she and her husband have two young children, they get up at 6.15 a.m. every morning, drag the children out of bed, get them ready to go down to the crèche, spend 40 minutes on the motorway trying to get to work. She said that if the weather is bad or there is an accident life is not just difficult, it is an obstacle course. She said she was not speaking for herself, but for 600,000 more. The quality of life of many of our people has been hampered by bad planning, mismanagement and lack of attention within the partnership model.Partnership with community is a vital concept in the building of new policies, but it is clear that in the current social partnership forum, there are some who are in the premiership and some who are very much in the lower divisions. The employers and unions are in the top league, whereas the wider community interests, representing the concerns of the environment, the consumer, the life-cycle pressure on the families caught in the backwash of economic progress, are relegated to lower leagues.As politicians, we should be prepared to accept our share of culpability for allowing this model to develop in the way it has and not challenging it when we knew we should have. Perhaps the fragmentation of opposition in the Dáil over the years has stunted the quality of the political debate and added to the scepticism about the effectiveness of elected institutions.The partnership process allows Government to shelter from strong political accountability. Typically when an attack comes, the Government wraps the flag of social partnership around itself. The Dáil has been emasculated as a forum where conflicts between competing interests in public policy can be worked out openly and transparently. In its place, a new pecking order of access to key decision makers has developed.One of the lessons of the recent spate of tribunals must be the need to build strong and effective accountability. The fragmentation in politics undoubtedly shows that the public also senses the manner in which the consensus has failed to live up to the day-to-day pressures of people's lives. The current model of social partnership is top-down. It increasingly shows us that it is not capable of tackling our problems effectively. It has a great deal to offer, but it will fail if it develops within a cosy consensus of insiders. Many small businesses, rank and file union members, the employees of the 70% of companies which are not unionised and many voters feel left on the outside. There needs to be a much more robust public debate about the purpose and framework of partnership.In the case of the most recent agreement, many business people say privately that a significant sector of industry agreed to it because it feared industrial relations anarchy with which it no longer has the structures to deal. This also applies to many unions. Overall, industry was split between those who needed a long pay pause and those for whom pay is a small part of their cost structure but maintaining production is vital. The majority was in between with the industrial relations factor predominant. For its part the Government needs the agreement to provide the platform for dealing with the public service unions and I understand that. Most participants are aware that the process is outmoded but do not have an alternative to offer.The real challenge must be to make this a genuine people's partnership, not a partnership of vested interests, however widely defined. We must and should have a real debate about this model. The limitations of our current top-down social partnership model must be debated, scrutinised and questioned. Industrial peace is important and vital, but it should not be our only concern. Consensus has an important place but the challenges Ireland faces today need a much more robust airing inside and outside the House.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	490	We broadly welcome the Bill as a common sense measure. It is a sad reflection on the Government that it has taken so long to bring such simple legislation before the House. While it could be argued that the establishment of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance would have delayed the Bill, the centre has been up and running for more than 18 months. Although there may be points of detail to discuss on Committee Stage, on its first reading the Bill is simple legislation which has been promised for several years. That such straightforward legislation could be so long delayed is reflective of the malaise of indecision in even the simplest matters that characterises the Government's discussions.That said, I welcome the basic idea behind the Bill. Social partnership has been an important part of economic governance in Ireland since 1987. We could argue that it has served the country well for the most part. As in other European countries, effective social partnership requires effective social partnership institutions. In particular, the success of partnership since 1987 has depended on the shared analysis of problems which the National Economic and Social Council and, later, the National Economic and Social Forum have facilitated. Similarly, the task of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance is a vital one. The successful development of partnership in the workplace is a necessary condition of continuing successful partnership at national level.I want to go back to the original ideas of the National Economic and Social Forum which was established in 1993 when I was Minister of State in the then Department of Social Welfare dealing with issues of poverty and disadvantage and the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance. I recall that the two specific aims were to widen social partnership beyond a cosy world of the included and include representatives of the excluded, disadvantaged, unemployed, young people, women and so on, and to involve elected Members of the Oireachtas to bring a policy focus on the issue of disadvantage.That wider concept of social partnership is effectively in tatters. The failure of the Minister for Finance to put real money on the table in the partnership deal, Sustaining Progress, to address disadvantage has meant that the third pillar of social partnership, namely, the community and voluntary sector and so on, is no longer really in place. Organisations such as the National Women's Council and the Simon Community were not prepared to put their imprimatur on a deal that, as far as real commitments to disadvantage were concerned, was a charade.One of the valuable aspects of the NESF's work since its inception was a hotline into policymakers. The forum's path-breaking work on long-term unemployment in its influential report No. 4 played an important role in ensuring that practical solutions which had worked in places such as Coolock and Ballymun were adopted as Government policy. This is because the Government of the day established a task force on long-term unemployment to advance the proposals put forward by the NESF. I pushed for lone parents to be allowed to earn a certain amount of money. The Taoiseach will recall the discussions which allowed them do so on a pilot basis. This was critical in identifying a set of people who had been excluded. Unfortunately, the type of ground-breaking approach established then has not continued in recent times. One of the reasons is the change in the ideological complexion of the Government.The evidence suggests the Government no longer listens to what the forum has to say, and I regret that. I am delighted the Taoiseach and a number of Ministers have spoken in recent days about a return to the debate on disadvantage. There are people in my constituency and that of the Taoiseach for whom this debate is critically important. Despite the Celtic tiger, many in our communities are still disadvantaged.I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the number of reports that show how little progress has been made. In a report in 2000 on social and affordable housing, the NESF called for a target for eliminating housing waiting lists, a national housing authority to accelerate the provision of houses for the poorest and action on land prices where huge profits and windfall gains on land were being made at the expense of first-time buyers and hard-pressed local authorities. As a member of the old Dublin County Council in the worst days, I can say that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael disgraced themselves on many occasions in their decisions on certain types of land rezoning.What has been the Government's response to this report? There is no target for people on housing waiting lists who have been largely left to rot. Such lists have increased by one quarter in the three years from 1999 to 2002. More families are on housing waiting lists now than there are full-time farmers. As the low rate of new local authority housing, built and bought, that came on stream last year was just under 3,000, it would take 16 years to clear current housing lists, even if not a single family were to apply for housing in the interim. Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was abandoned and this made a mockery of targets for social and affordable housing and the notion of up to 20% of housing being reserved for those on low and modest incomes.Since I returned to Fingal County Council in 1999, as the Labour Party leader on it and together with the other parties, I have made a point of facilitating the building of local authority social and affordable housing. The Taoiseach will know that Fingal is a model in terms of the numbers it has produced. All members of the council worked together and few other councils in the country can show this. It is regrettable that the Government abandoned this method that was producing results. Some 18,000 sites for social and affordable housing have been lost with the stroke of a pen. The big builders who control so much of the land, many of whom are contributors to the Taoiseach's party and, in many cases, provide good housing, have not been able to grasp the concept of allowing people on lower incomes or seeking social or affordable housing into their estates. This Government has been bad for this. The social partnership model should have facilitated, encouraged and strengthened this change. This is why the current social partnership model is failing so terribly.There has been no action on building land. Instead, land speculators, many of whom are familiar figures from the tribunals, have been handed a bonus by the Minister's decision to permanently halve capital gains on development land. This is another serious mistake. There is still no sign of a national housing authority.A NESF report published last April looked at the two-tier system of hospital care. It argued for a single system where medical need, not the depth of one's purse, should determine access to essential medical treatment. What was the Government's response? More beds have been closed in the public hospital system and this is driving more people towards private medicine. The two-tier structure of the system has not been addressed, rather it has been enhanced by last minute tax breaks for private hospitals. Last minute changes in the Finance Act 2001 were rushed in to benefit a handful of private hospital promoters at an estimated cost to taxpayers of at least €20 million. The State is paying 42% of the capital cost to these promoters through tax breaks on their incomes. What is the measly return? Public patients may be treated in 20% of the beds at 90% of the standard charge. This is a 2% return to a public that has provided 42% of the money. While I know this is a little PD idea, it does not represent value for money in our health system or to those on the waiting lists.In last year's Finance Act, tax relief was extended to private promoters of sports injuries clinics. What market failure was that trying to address? This year's Finance Act saw another last minute change for promoters of private day hospitals at a cost of €9 million. One of these hospitals is located in the constituency of the Minister for Finance. This benefited one or two individuals while simultaneously copper-fastening the public-private divide in our hospital system.The Government may talk the talk of social inclusion but it does not walk the walk. The record is one of cuts in services to the poor, whether it is community employment schemes, RAPID, programmes to address educational disadvantage and school dropouts, housing or the public hospital system. At the same time the tax system offers a parallel and thriving hidden welfare state for the well-off. Top earners can reduce their tax bills to almost zero by investing in specially favoured activities, including stud farms, holiday homes, multi-storey car parks, private hospitals, sports injury clinics or generous pensions. The Minister for Finance made great play in this year's Finance Act that he was ending some of these tax loopholes. Although in some cases the end-date was brought forward, the termination date was actually extended in the case of tax reliefs on town renewal projects and park and ride schemes.In its statistical report, the Revenue Commissioners admit there are 33 tax breaks where it has no idea of the cost in tax forgone. We do not know how much tax relief on stallion fees costs the rest of us, we do not know the cost of giving tax relief for new holiday homes in seaside resorts and we do not know how much income is sheltered behind tax relief on income from foreign trusts. However, we know these tax breaks systematically benefit those who are best off in society. It is not done in the open like walking through the front door of UCD, Trinity or NUI, Galway. It is done behind closed doors where the parallel welfare state offered through tax breaks to the favoured few is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, nor is it subject to proper scrutiny by either the Committee of Public Accounts or the finance committee.The SSIA is another measure where the more one has the more one gets. The total cost this year of €500 million will accrue most to those who can afford to save at the expense of those who can barely survive from week to week. A recent survey conducted by the Vincentian partnership has shown that families on social welfare cannot afford the healthy diet recommended by the Department of Health and Children without running into debt if they buy fresh fruit and vegetables. The Minister's tenure in the Department of Finance saw him systematically redistributing the benefits of the boom upwards. It must be a comment on the nature of social partnership as it exists that the social partnership structure has not been able to address the redistribution of tax benefits and tax expenditures upwards to the most well off in society.An analysis of what has been happening shows that more has been given back to those at the top of the pile than to those at the bottom. This is the same Minister for Finance I heard say that the abolition of third level fees was the most socially regressive step ever taken by an Irish Government. I know the Taoiseach has often visited and given great personal and political support to St. Vincent's on the Navan Road and Holy Angels in Knockmaroon. There is a failure at the heart of social partnership if we cannot work out a situation where a severely disabled girl approaching her 18th birthday, who has been in day care for all of her life, will not have day care service when she turns 18. What are her family and siblings to do? The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, also attended the meeting and saw the distraught state the parents were in.I see a particular benefit in bringing the three organisations together. It should enable the type of high-level strategic work in which the NESC is engaged to be informed by the information coming back from the workplace through the centre or working groups established by the NESF. Equally, the flow of information and analysis between all these groups that can come from being part of the new body can be positive for all concerned.I welcome that the Bill provides for flexibility with respect to the configuration of social partnership institutions as time moves on and different bodies may need to be represented. Should it be deemed necessary in the future, further partnership institutions can be established under the auspices of the NESDO. Social partnership is constantly evolving and it is important that the institutions that support it can evolve with it. In saying that, institutions are not enough. The existence of the NESDO or of any social partnership agreements alone are not sufficient to guarantee the success of partnership. A genuine spirit of partnership is also required. This does not mean each of the social partners must drop their own views and identities and allow them to be subsumed into some general consensus, but there needs to be some genuine element of give and take on all sides if partnership is to succeed. That is why I believe partnership in Ireland is now in deep crisis. Whatever spirit of genuine partnership existed in the past has been replaced by the Government's insistence on a narrow right-wing agenda.Much was written in the 1970s and 1980s by academics about what was called "social corporatism". For many of these writers, successful partnership in a range of European countries resulted from the presence in Government of social democratic parties. The Irish experience after 1987 was in this respect a surprising one, in that a right-wing party such as Fianna Fáil was apparently able to establish successful social partnership. This puzzling fact for academics could be explained by the fact that although it was on the right, Fianna Fáil's commitment to pragmatism enabled it to do business with the trade union movement. I acknowledge that the Taoiseach's contribution in that was significant. Since 1997, however, that has changed. Fianna Fáil has become an increasingly right-wing party. Its coalition with the Progressive Democrats is only part of what has driven this Government to the right. There are now more PD-thinking Fianna Fáil Ministers in Cabinet than there are Progressive Democrats proper. This shift to the right is increasingly incompatible with effective social partnership. This Government may have an agreement, but it does not have a partnership.The Government's right-wing credentials have been hidden somewhat by the boom. With the country awash with money, and their determination to win the election at any cost, Ministers were able to trumpet their so-called achievements in increasing public spending in various areas. That they were able to do so was the result of an historic boom in the economy which was the creation of successive Governments – a boom which was badly managed in recent times and which this Government brought to a premature end. However, while they had money to splurge on getting re-elected, Ministers made sure to reduce the share of public spending on GNP and give tax breaks to the better off. Had they had any genuine interest in public services, they would have delivered resources in a sustained and sustainable way, matched by structural reform to ensure value for money to the taxpayer. Instead, we got stop-go economics, with an all-out assault on public services when times got a bit tougher.I do not know how the Taoiseach will solve the problem of the administrative model of top-level management reform that his Government has created, which has resulted in the expansion of the numbers of top-level jobs in all the institutions. The old Eastern Health Board became the ERHA plus three subsidiary boards. They all have a management structure and middle management. It is like the man who got fat. These organisations would definitely be on Unislim if they were people. This has happened in local authorities and in a number of third level institutions. It is massively costly, with no visible value-for-money return in terms of services for the user, whether he or she is an individual taxpayer or a business person. The Government will need partnership to sort this out.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I do not know how the Taoiseach will sort it out. It would be quite a job for anyone. Social partnership might be one of the ways out of this; unfortunately, it has been systematically undermined. The Government's failure to tackle problems in infrastructure and public services placed increasing pressure on social partnership agreements under this Government. We also had the problem of under-investment, which undermined the quality of life in a booming economy. Further tax cuts were not a route to addressing these issues, but the Government has had no interest in being diverted from its ideological agenda, whatever the social partners might say. I do not blame IBEC or the trade unions for this, as some people choose to do. As employers and unions, it is their job to represent the interests of their members as they see fit. However, they must also live with the ideological complexities of the Government of the day. IBEC has made it clear where its political preferences lie, although I doubt that is something about which all of its members are happy.A partnership agreement which is one-sided, and completely driven by a right-wing ideology, has little to offer. It may be important to preserve the institution of social partnership, but we cannot, as a country, expect to yield the same benefits from Sustaining Progress as we did from other partnership agreements. Those benefits – industrial peace, low-inflationary growth, relative certainty for investors and credibility for macro-economic policy – will not necessarily be preserved by this Government in the current agreement.Despite all the talk we have heard in recent days about disadvantage, there is nothing of substance in this agreement to tackle disadvantage. I applaud the honesty of those community and voluntary groups who were prepared to say out loud that the emperor has no clothes. We know the Taoiseach does not like criticism. He does not like the illusion of a cosy world in which he is doing his best for everyone to be punctured by reality. The reality is that he does his bit for the rich and very little for the disadvantaged. He has made it clear that those groups who did not sign up to Sustaining Progress will feel the chill wind of his pique at their effrontery.There is at present no National Economic and Social Council; the mandate of the previous council has expired. When the next council is appointed, it would be shameful for the Government to exclude those groups who did not sign up to Sustaining Progress. If there is to be any prospect of a return to genuine social partnership in the future, the solution is not to cut off dissenting voices, particularly those of the groups that left the partnership process unwillingly, driven out by the failure of Government to address their concerns after years of talking. If we ever want the partnership process to recapture its momentum – which I genuinely think the Taoiseach does – excluding these groups from the strategic considerations of the NESC would be counter-productive.

I welcome this development. However, can progress be made in the areas of poverty and unemployment? It was lovely to think, in the now dim and distant Celtic tiger era, that the poverty and unemployment traps would be eliminated. In fact, such aspirations could not have been said, in those heady days, to be beyond the bounds of possibility.CORI has frequently pressed for some redistribution of the national fortune towards those who are in greatest need. The Government would put its money where its mouth is by thus constructing a fairer future, ensuring inclusiveness and ensuring that all benefit from future economic growth. Essential requirements would be a fundamental redesign of the tax and welfare system, effective targeting of all social exclusion, a focus on the social as well as the physical infrastructure and the recognition of the need to ensure that all development is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.The Celtic tiger has become virtually extinct. Marginalised people would not recognise the animal unless they had the wherewithal to visit Dublin Zoo or Fota Wildlife Park, where they could conceivably get a glimpse of it. The marginalised, poor and unemployed unfortunately do not have the same lobbying clout as organised groups such as farmers, teachers, nurses or consultants. Lip service has been constantly paid to those on the margins by successive Governments even though such Governments were generally in the happy position of being able to pay somewhat more than this. At budget time, various interest groups seek a slice of the action, quite justifiably in many cases.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	497	There has been much comment in the past few days about inflation in this country. Last week, Forfás published its consumer pricing report and the National Competitiveness Council published a statement on inflation. I welcome to the debate these contributions to reducing inflation.The fact that in Ireland our rate of inflation is higher than that of our main trading competitors is a cause of concern to the Government. As I have said on many occasions, our inflation rate must be reduced to that of our EU partners if competitiveness, which has been so instrumental to our economic success, is to be maintained. The Government is working with the social partners to focus on the sources of inflationary pressure under the auspices of the anti-inflation initiative which forms part of Sustaining Progress. For example, I have noted that among the individual expenditure categories, Forfás estimates that inflation in the pubs and restaurants category accounted for nearly 30% of inflation.In addition, ensuring that wage increases are limited to those set out in Sustaining Progress will also contribute to further reducing inflation. I am also of the view that keeping public expenditure to target has an important role in moderating our inflation rate and I have put in place management and control mechanisms to ensure this. It is true that indirect taxation and administered price increases have had an impact on the rate of inflation. It was estimated that the indirect tax changes announced in the budget added approximately 0.85% to the CPI. However, these increases were necessary to generate revenue to fund the cost of providing public services while keeping the direct taxation burden low.Since the budget, there have been some price increases in services provided by public agencies. However, not all of these increases require Government approval. For example, electricity increases are sanctioned by an independent regulator and are not subject to Government control. It is important to stress at this point that inflation is falling. According to the most recent CSO data, inflation fell to 4.3% by end-April, representing the greatest fall in the annual rate since early 2001. Services sector inflation is also moderating. The challenge now is to ensure that we reduce inflation as quickly as we can and the Government is committed to this objective.

Does he further accept that if one took the Government contribution out of the equation this year, inflation here would be in line with the EU average and we would not have competitiveness problems?Does the Minister accept that there is something fundamentally wrong when the services for which he is responsible are seeking price increases of 15% and upwards at a time when private manufacturing industry is having to take 7% cuts in their prices? Does he agree that this poses huge challenges to him and his Ministers in managing their services to deliver value for money?

They have met on a number of occasions and are reviewing all areas.It is true to say that indirect tax increases would contribute somewhat to the rate of inflation. This was estimated at budget time to be in the region of 0.85% in respect of the CPI. It is also true that at budget time other areas are competing for increased expenditure and that the Government has to decide on a variety of expenditure measures and some taxation changes. There have been some increases in the areas to which the Deputy refers, but the VAT and excise increases announced on budget day put them at 0.85%.What is unusual about the 0.85% figure is that 0.65% of it relates to indirect tax increases on cigarettes and alcohol. I was lobbied by Deputies on all sides of the House to considerably increase the price of alcohol and cigarettes, but I did not hear anyone take it into account during the wage talks. People advocate increases in indirect taxes but do not take them into account when they affect inflation rates. Had I done what Deputies asked, budget day increases would have contributed to considerably in excess of 0.85%.We must address certain areas of competition. Deputy Bruton referred to our position vis-à-vis that of our partners. We have a higher growth than our partners and have lower unemployment rates than those of our competitor partners.

This is filtering through to every business trying to survive. The reality is that the Minister is adding to inflation five times more than other EU Ministers for Finance. He is then demanding that we move to the EU average. It is the Minister for Finance who has it within his power to do so, yet he has not come forward with a single proposal to address the specific question I raised.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax treatment to apply in public private partnerships, where the developer designs, builds, finances and operates – DBFO – the facility, was established by the Revenue Commissioners in June 2001. That treatment was applied in the bundle of schools projects and the National Maritime College before confirmation was sought in relation to the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway. A guidance note prepared by Revenue setting out the treatment is due to be published as part of a series of guidance notes on public private partnerships to be published by the special unit in my Department dealing with these type of projects.Section 65 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is the legislative basis for taxing trading profits and provides that tax shall be charged on the full amount of the profits arising in a year of assessment. The section does not give any guidance on how the profits are to be computed. The profits of a trade for taxation purposes are ascertained in accordance with the ordinary principles of commercial accountancy unless there is a specific tax rule to the contrary. The Accounting Standards Board publishes Financial Reporting Standards. Standard No. 5, entitled "Reporting the substance of transactions", provides the specific guidance for the recognition of profits in the case of public private partnerships.Under the DBFO arrangements the developer designs, builds, finances and operates the facilities. They are licensed to operate the facility for a certain period after which the property reverts to the State for nil consideration to the developer. The expenses incurred on developing the property are incurred for the purposes of earning a profit from the operation and are, therefore, of a revenue nature. The accountancy standard FRS5 allows, effectively, for the amortisation of these expenses in the profit and loss account of the developer, in other words the expenses can be written off over the life of the contract at a fixed amount per year. This is a method of matching the costs of the development with the receipts from the public private partnership contract. Revenue accepts the profits as disclosed in accounts prepared in accordance with FRS5 as the profit for tax purposes from the public private partnership contract of the developer-operator.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Minister would therefore agree with me that the consortium who got the franchise for the PPP on the Kilcock-Kinnegad route got, first, a franchise to charge motorway tolls and then as the Minister has just disclosed, access to tax allowances in addition to a 65% subsidy from the State for constructing the road. That is a triple "whammy" for the road-user, who pays the subsidy which is the State's contribution, who pays the tolls and who now is funding, through tax expenditures, the tax breaks for the company.I received correspondence from some of the companies involved. The Minister read out the relevant accounting documentation which argues substance over form, and I accept that, but the reality therefore is that the rolled-up capital value of the road, including the very high transaction costs, legal fees, etc., which are included in the cost of any PPP, including the capital cost of the road, is now available to that company to be written off for tax purposes.Why is the statement from the Revenue Commissioner on the tax breaks available for PPPs not yet published? The companies may know, but the House of the Oireachtas does not know, economists who are trying to value PPPs do not know and general public certainly do not know that they are getting this triple "whammy" of the tolls, subsidising the cost of the road and now paying the cost of the tax breaks. The Minister must come clean and explain this to the House.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	510	As far as I was aware, the Deputy's party is in favour of the principle of PPPs, unless there is a change, not alone in the leadership of the Labour Party but also in its long-standing policy in this regard. Public private partnerships have been welcomed on most sides of the House and also by the trade union movement, subject to their usual provisos.What the Deputy dealt with, the question of the matters to which the Deputy referred, would have been taken into account before a franchise was decided for that motorway. What I am asked to deal with here, the tax treatment of PPPs in this context, is dealt with, as I pointed out in my reply, in the normal context under the normal accounting standards which apply to this area, and there is nothing unusual about this. In simple terms, it is very similar to the treatment of a developer of land when it is being used as part of his housing development. It is treated as stock in trade rather than as a capital asset, and the cost of the development can be written off against the developer's income.The Deputy asked here about the tax treatment of this transaction. I outlined what it is and there is nothing unusual about it. Leading up to any of the PPPs, including the maritime college and the bundle of schools project, the Revenue Commissioners have treated this in the same way and therefore there is nothing unusual in the tax treatment regarding the concession the winner has got in the case of the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway.The matter of the tax advantage would be taken into account in the assessment of the overall financial model for a PPP. The tax treatment is taken into it as part of the calculation before a decision is made to grant a PPP. It is part of the calculation mechanism.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	511	What the Minister has given us today is new information. The information he has just given is not available. How can we then calculate the value for money of a traditional road project funded directly by the State, as opposed to a PPP, if the full value of the tax breaks for the PPP consortium are not clearly laid out? They are not clearly laid out. The Revenue, as the Minister stated, has not yet published the full guidelines. How are Members of this House supposed to make a judgment?Can the Minister give me the cost of the tax benefit, over the life of the contract, to the consortium who have taken on the PPP for the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway so that we can calculate and include it in the calculation of the cost of that PPP? How else do we get an estimate of whether the taxpayer is getting value for money, whether for a road or the bundle of schools?

Bidders for PPP projects prepare complex financial models which model their projected income and expenditure over the concession period. Tax payable is an integral part of these models. In submitting their tender, bidders will have targeted the required return on the investment and tendered accordingly. The tax treatment referred to forms part of that calculation.Moreover each project is subject to a value for money assessment. These assessments take account of all relevant Exchequer cash flows including public expenditure and tax revenues, and any tax benefit accruing to the private sector is evaluated as part of the assessment of the PPP project.

As I have said previously, a wide range of important issues, including the National Spatial Strategy, must be considered before a final decision is taken on this matter. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their future or departmental management concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility.The Deputy will appreciate that the Government cannot announce its plans for the relocation of civil servants until a final decision is reached. Given the wide ranging considerations involved, it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will make that decision.

At that time the Minister stated that we would have a programme of decentralisation that would be more radical than all that had happened before. There is nothing radical about absolute inertia. Can the Minister say why in October 2000, within ten months of that commitment and in response to my oral and written parliamentary questions, he stated that the Government would be in a position to take decisions on the programme by the end of 2000? It is written in the Official Report of the House.Will the Minister tell the House what happened between that time, that commitment given in October 2000 and November 2002, when he said for the first time what he has now repeated in response to my question? He stated that he could not say when the Government would take a decision. What happened in that period of time, from the time of the Minister's enthusiasm, his stated intent and his statement that it would be a radical move on his part which would facilitate the transfer of significant numbers to the order of 10,000 civil servants to new locations in different parts of the State?When the Minister talks about spatial strategy will he recognise and confirm the strong case for Monaghan, a hub town? Is he in a position to confirm that it will be included in the list of those towns that will be welcome hosts for many of the civil servants and their families who will be deployed to the provinces?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	524	It was perhaps an unfortunate phrase to use which included the word "radical". That inspired every town and city in Ireland to make very detailed presentations to me and my Department. They each made a very good case for their centre to be included in the planned programme of decentralisation. As I stated previously, more than 120 urban centres have made detailed submissions as to why their centres should be favoured above all other areas. I would have liked to progress the matter sooner but a great deal of consultation and work has been put into this area. I am sure Deputy Ó Caoláin has made a good case for the town he has mentioned and I am sure there are many reasons Departments should locate there just as there are good reasons for them to go to Counties, Laois, Offaly, Leitrim, Kildare, Galway and all the other places for which others have made a case.I hope to be in a position to bring this matter to a conclusion. As I stated previously, there will be more places disappointed than pleased and that has led to some of the difficulties and has given rise to the delay over that period.

What happened shortly after that stated commitment of October 2000 when the Minister stated that by the end of that year, the programme for decentralisation would be ready for publication? Where did that go and why? What were the influences and pressures and why have they been maintained? We see no light at the end of the tunnel and the Minister is offering none today.In the recent Private Members' Business debate on this issue, the Minister said he would not be drawn on a timescale for the implementation of the new programme. Will the Minister clarify that a timescale actually exists? Is it the case, as many of us suspect, that there is no timescale at all and that proposal, despite all the Minister's earlier signposted enthusiasm, does not appear on the agenda of this Government and if it appears at all, it is at the very bottom of the list?

The Deputy asked about the delay and I have given the reasons. I point out to him that perhaps it is better to travel in hope than to arrive. I will pass on his compliments to the Taoiseach as to his influence on all members of the Government.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I would not agree with the Deputy's premise that high earners in Ireland make a very low tax contribution. Top earners in many cases make a very substantial tax contribution to the Exchequer, for example, the most recent figures available from the Revenue Commissioners indicate that for the tax year 1999-2000 just over 1% of the highest income earners contributed more than 20% of the annual income tax take.The Deputy may be referring to the effective tax rate of individual earners. The Revenue Commissioners carried out a study in 2002 on the effective tax rates for high earning individuals based on the tax year 1999-2000 which is the latest year for which the relevant data was available. As is the case with an earlier 1997 study, I have placed a copy of the study in the Oireachtas Library.The study referred to was carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in 2002. Of the top 400 earners' cases examined in the 2002 study, 117 had an effective tax rate of less than 30%; 231 had an effective rate between 30% and 44%; 52 had an effective rate of 45% and higher. Of the 117 earners with an effective rate of less than 30%, 51 had an effective rate of less than 5% and 29 of those 51 top earners had an effective rate of 0%.However, this study indicates an increase in the effective tax rate of high earners in 1999-2000 compared with the findings of a similar study carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in 1997 on the effective tax rates of high earners in the tax years 1993-1994 and 1994-1995. One of the conclusions drawn from the 1997 study was that the use of capital allowances on buildings was one of the main methods of reducing the tax bills of high earners to very low levels. I subsequently capped the amount of capital allowances on buildings that could be set off against non-rental income.Arising from this latest study, I announced in budget 2003 the abolition of capital allowances for investment in registered holiday cottages and the reduction in capital allowances for hotels to the rate applying generally to industrial buildings. I also indicated that a range of reliefs would not be extended beyond their end 2004 termination date.While I support properly designed tax reliefs, the unintended use of the tax system by exploiting loopholes to reduce the tax paid by high earners is not my aim. Since taking up office as Minister for Finance, I have acted swiftly to address tax avoidance schemes that serve to narrow the tax base. The 2003 Finance Act contains a series of such anti-avoidance measures.Tax reliefs have been introduced by all Ministers for Finance including by my immediate predecessor. All tax incentive schemes are kept under regular review, especially in the context of the annual budget and Finance Bill process, to ensure they continue to meet the purpose or purposes for which they were introduced.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I thank the Minister for his reply and for his presentation of that report to the Oireachtas. Will he agree that a situation where some of the top earners pay no tax and one in five of them pay less than 20%, is not an acceptable situation? Will he agree with me that the study shows that those top 117 earners which he mentioned each received tax relief worth €600,000? Will he further agree that the bevy of tax breaks available to these top earners is really adding to public anger about a situation where we see, despite a collapse in the value of shareholdings, that top executives and executive directors are paying themselves 25% increases, that their bonuses and top-up payments come to 150% on top of their basic pay and the Minister is facilitating them with all these tax breaks?Is it not the case that most of these tax breaks will go to the sheltered sector where there is no competitive edge to be achieved for the country? They were mainly in the building industry which has been overheating all throughout those years and thereby adding to the difficulty for small investors wishing to buy a home for themselves. Does it not create a very wasteful tax gain for accountants – and the Minister was an accountant in a previous life – by chasing these breaks and wasting their energy? Is there not also a problem as to who is the gatekeeper? In the case of Beaumont Hospital, tax breaks worth €13 million were given in a project whose total cost was only €8 million? Will he agree with me that this issue must be addressed by him far more vigorously than it has been to date in his six budgets and as he enters what he calls the next volume of his series?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	531	It is interesting to compare the most recent report with the 1997 report. The latter report influenced my decision to introduce a cap of £25,000 on capital allowances outside the ring fence. Although it did not receive great publicity, it was one of the most effective measures I introduced to limit the allowances in these areas. Deputy Richard Bruton, who has raised some interesting questions, will know from his Government experience how difficult it is to abolish a scheme. I have abolished some of the schemes and I have said that I will abolish more next year.Properly focused tax reliefs have considerable benefits. The Deputy will agree that the urban renewal scheme, which was introduced almost 20 years ago, has led to the transformation of many of our major cities. After I signalled that I intended to abolish certain tax breaks, I received representations from all sides of the House in relation to what I will do in 2004. Film tax relief, which is much loved by a colleague of Deputy Burton, is recognised as having helped to bring film-making to Ireland. It is the single most attractive tax concession in the tax code as one cannot lose on it. People in this House who have availed of it are aware that it is a singular effective tax break, that it provides a guaranteed income, more or less, and that there is no risk at all. People should be very clear about this. As tax breaks will always be availed of by high earners, one has to balance the level of economic activity with the loss to the Exchequer.Tax breaks should be abolished when they outlive their useful life, and I have tried to do this. Tax breaks which were introduced to the tax code for particular purposes – I introduced some of them – should be abolished when their period of usefulness has elapsed. As Deputy Richard Bruton knows and Deputy Burton will know, the abolition of tax breaks causes difficulties. There are always good projects out there. A balance has to be struck between economic activity and the loss to the Exchequer. While focused tax incentives have a part to play, their usefulness has to be measured so that they can be abolished when a certain period of time has passed. An example of a particularly focused tax relief was the scrappage tax relief and, as Deputy Burton knows, certain people thought at the time that it should not have been abolished.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I have a copy of the comparison. Six people were found in the second study to have paid less tax than they did in the previous study. There was no great improvement in the tax contribution, according to the study. Does the Minister not agree that if he wants to promote good things, such as film-making, it would be far better to do it by way of subsidy? Such a system would mean, at least, that somebody would be controlling it and acting as gatekeeper, unlike in the Beaumont Hospital example. A subsidy system would not have the huge inequitable distribution effects, whereby top earners use tax breaks to wash out their money. They pay less tax than those who clean their offices.

I am further advised that the overseas assets group in the commissioners' office is in the early stages of an inquiry into the matter. The inquiry will involve establishing whether there are tax liabilities and taking action to recover the tax, together with interest and penalties. The Revenue Commissioners' inquiry will also involve establishing whether breaches of tax legislation took place. As the investigations are at a preliminary stage, it is not possible to estimate the extent to which offshore trusts have been or are being used to evade tax.I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that preliminary inquiries made following the media suggestions that funds have been moved from one institution to another indicate that the extent to which this has happened may have been overstated. The Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that they can use information relating to past transactions to identify those who have evaded tax. A move to a different bank or a different country will not alter the history of previous transactions and will not prevent or frustrate detection.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	546	Does the Minister agree that tax avoidance is the dark side of the Irish economy? Under the Minister's stewardship, tax avoidance has become social welfare for the rich. He speaks about the poverty industry, but the tax avoidance industry is the equivalent of social welfare for the rich. Is he aware that reliable estimates suggest that assets of as much as €5 billion are offshore in various islands near this jurisdiction? These arrangements are coming to an end, but representatives of a prominent Swiss bank were in town recently to hold interviews with wealthy possible clients who may be distressed because they are facing inquiries by the Revenue Commissioners. Does the Minister agree that this type of tax avoidance – it may also be tax evasion – is eroding the confidence of the ordinary taxpayer and the working family who pay taxes but have to watch this parade of the very wealthy avoiding their taxation responsibilities?I asked the Minister of State a question last week about a tax device being used by an Irish consortium on the Christina O boat. They were to receive about €25 million in tax breaks. What are the Minister's officials and the Revenue Commissioners doing to tackle some of the people who have offshore funds of up to €5 billion? Will these individuals be cruising to another tax haven on the Christina O, aided and abetted by the Minister's failure to take serious upfront action to tackle this scandal? We already know what was disclosed by the DIRT inquiry and the various tribunals. It was said about ten years ago that there was no pot of gold in relation to non-compliance by the rich, but that has been shown to be absolutely untrue. I want to know what steps the Minister is taking to ensure that these people pay their fair share of tax. Can the €5 billion be brought back into this country? We could do with the money to help to provide the infrastructure we are lacking.

She will be aware that tax avoidance is legal, but tax evasion is not. I thought she had tax evasion in mind in this question. It is tax evasion if the moneys in the offshore trusts came from taxable revenues which have not been properly disclosed in this State. I thought that the supposition in the Deputy's question was that this was tax evasion. She can be quite certain that some offshore trusts are quite legal and quite tax compliant. The Deputy should also be aware that not all funds in a foreign subsidiary of an Irish bank belong to Irish citizens. The money in other tax jurisdictions held by Irish banks does not necessarily belong to Irish citizens. No Minister for Finance in the history of the State has given the Revenue Commissioners more powers in Finance Acts to preclude tax evasion than I have. The Finance Act 1999, in particular, gave the Revenue Commissioners a host of powers that were not previously available to them. I have added to these powers in other respects.Tax avoidance is the legal use of sections of Finance Acts or other legislation for purposes for which they were not intended. No Minister has acted as quickly as me to close off the unintended uses of legislation. I acted in this manner in the recent Finance Bill and in announcements I have made since that Bill. The Revenue Commissioners are charged with operating the tax code and are engaged in this investigation at present. The Deputy referred to Ansbacher in part of her contribution and I should point out to her that there is a later question about that issue. The total amount of money raised so far from the Ansbacher investigations is only €23 million. This process will take a long time. The tax yield from the banks and Irish citizens who paid on foot of the investigations into bogus non-resident accounts is 20 times that figure.

Is he not concerned that hundreds of this bank's clients were reported by the media to be lining up to get information from this Swiss bank about moving their assets further offshore to Switzerland where they would be even more protected? Does the Minister not agree that he needs to act swiftly and with imagination for the sake of the ordinary compliant taxpayer—

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Very briefly, Minister.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I wish to point out to the Deputy – and to any taxpayer in this regard – that there would be no benefit in transferring money to a hidden destination in any country, if the information is known to the Revenue Commissioners. It will not be of any benefit to a person even if money is taken out of the bank and buried in a hole in the garden. In the light of investigations by the Revenue Commissioners under the powers available to them, they know where the money was up to that stage. Even if you ran off with it then—
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Is the Minister saying that the Revenue Commissioners know their names?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	554	Yes, they do. In using the powers available to them, the Revenue Commissioners have come across a lot of information and know the names of many of these individuals. What will happen to them subsequently will be another day's work. People will have to account for money which is not tax cleared because the fact remains that they had the money in the first place.An agreement was recently reached with the Swiss authorities regarding the exchange of information in regard to the savings directive which we are concluding at ECOFIN. One of the reasons we had not been able to conclude the directive up to now is that some countries within the EU, such as Luxembourg, were anxious that there would be reciprocal arrangements from non-EU countries, otherwise their cash base would be at risk. The ECOFIN ministers and Commissioner Bolkestein have more or less concluded the framework of an agreement which will allow for an exchange of information between the Swiss authorities.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	555	We must proceed to the next question.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	557	That concludes priority questions. We move on now to other questions. I find it necessary once again to remind the House that under Standing Orders these questions are governed by a maximum limit of six minutes. Supplementary questions and answers also have a maximum of one minute each.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	558	Policy in relation to debt and deficit levels for Ireland must be addressed in the context of the EU treaty and Stability and Growth Pact. Under the EU treaty, member states must aim to keep their general government debt levels at or below 60% of GDP. In the most recent return to the EU Commission in March, my Department reported that Ireland was expected to have a general Government debt level of 34% of GDP at end 2003.The treaty also requires that member states stay within a general government deficit limit of 3% of GDP. The Stability and Growth Pact reiterates this deficit requirement and requires further that member states should keep the finances of general government close to balance over the course of the economic cycle. Under the pact therefore, Ireland has given a commitment to keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this objective. The programme for Government clearly states that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overriding framework for Irish budgetary policy. The essential message of the Stability and Growth Pact is that through fiscal prudence we can ensure economic growth and fiscal stability.The budget projections last December included Exchequer borrowing requirements of €1.8 billion in 2003, €3.4 billion in 2004 and €3.7 billion in 2005. This borrowing would increase the level of our general Government debt.We need to be careful in increasing our borrowing not to allow it to grow so significantly that we repeat the mistakes of the past, when a large proportion of current spending was used up in paying interest on our debt. We cannot ignore the fact that tax revenue has slowed because economic activity has slowed. As a result, we will have less resources for new public spending. As I stated in my budget speech last December, we therefore have no choice but to move our expenditure, pay and cost levels on to a lower growth trajectory.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	559	Will the Minister clarify his view of the status of those figures he quoted, namely the €3.4 billion deficit on the Exchequer? Is he saying that this is an acceptable level which he will set as his target at the end of the 2004 budget or does he believe it is excessive or insufficient? Will the Minister comment on the views of the Tánaiste who was a party to the programme for Government but has a different viewpoint to his? She said that we are very under-borrowed as a country and points to the opportunity to expand borrowing to 4% of GDP, way ahead of the stability pact for infrastructural projects. Is the Government speaking out of two sides of its mouth on this? Is there any agreement between the parties in Government as to what is the correct strategy for borrowing? Perhaps the Minister would outline that because it is important to know whether the two parties in Government are at one on the issue of the extent to which we would borrow. The Minister seems to be saying that the right approach is a cautious one while the Tánaiste is saying something very different.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	560	We had better be clear on the figures for 2004 and 2005 which formed the earlier part of the Deputy's questions. The figure for 2004 of €3.4 billion is based on expenditure on the existing level of services and our projections for tax revenue based on expected growth rates as decided last December. As the Deputy knows, borrowing is the residual left between one's income and expenditure. Therefore, if the income side were to go down – and we will make a projection on that come the next budget – and if our expenditure were to stay at the same level as we thought last December, the difference would have to be greater than €3.4 billion this year and €3.7 billion in 2005. That is the basis of the calculation for 2004 and 2005. This has to be revisited in the light of our expected outcome for this year or expected growth in revenues for next year which depends—
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I know. I am asking what is the appropriate level.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	562	Just a second, I need to make sure we are talking about those particular figures. To go back to what we think is appropriate – the overriding matter in regard to budgetary policy is the Stability and Growth Pact. It is in the programme for Government.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	563	The Minister has now exceeded the time limit.

Even if that were not the case, it would still be my view, based on the lessons we learned in the past, to have prudent borrowing in the future.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	565	The Minister is well in excess of the one minute rule.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	566	This is the final point. Even if those figures were to be met; €1.8 billion this year, €3.4 billion next year and €3.5 the following year, that means over those three years we will have borrowed an extra €9 billion. We are borrowing a substantial amount of money for the next number of years.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I call Deputy Burton for the next supplementary.

All the evidence suggests that growth is not going to be as good as anyone anticipated.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	569	So it is a question of "Tánaiste, please take note."
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	570	Does the Minister agree with the Tánaiste who said that we are under-borrowed? The Minister said that the stability pact is a bit too tight in terms of the needs of the economy. In particular, does he share the views of the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland – that we are facing a massive infrastructural deficit and that prudent borrowing for key infrastructural projects would, in fact, be good for the economy? It would make fiscal sense but it would also allow us to become competitive again. Does the Minister agree with his colleague, the Tánaiste?What about the view expressed by his colleague at the weekend, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who published another Fianna Fáil rebuttal in which he seems to be on a different tack to the Minister and the Tánaiste? He seemed to indicate lower spending and lower borrowing. When the Cabinet sits down at the table in Farmleigh is there so much confusion that it is like a happy Italian family with everybody shouting in different directions or are conclusions reached there about a view on the economy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	571	The Deputy must conclude now.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	572	We will borrow a substantial amount of money over this year and the following two years, unless growth returns to a level that nobody expects. All that money we will be borrowing will go on capital infrastructure. I have brought capital spending up to 5% of gross national product, which is approximately double the EU rate and considerably in excess of what we were doing a few years ago. If we can continue to have capital spending at that level as a percentage of GNP, people will see a major difference to the country's infrastructure in the years to come. People should not be too simplistic in this regard, however, and say that all borrowing for capital purposes is good. All borrowing for capital purposes is not good if the capital project one is investing in does not give value for money and a proper return.In the context of the EU Stability and Growth Pact, we tried to have it recognised that countries with low debt and poor infrastructure would enjoy some flexibility. The Commission supported us as did the United Kingdom, but at the recent European Council that matter was debated, as it had been at previous ECOFIN meetings, and no progress was made. One of the reasons for that is that some countries with considerably higher debt wanted to be part of that flexibility also and I can readily see the Commission's problems in that regard.

Is there still a reluctance to use them and are they seen as a mechanism to avoid the GDP ratio under the Maastricht guidelines?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	582	It is not that I want to avoid Deputy Richard Bruton's question but at this stage it would be impossible for me to decide what the budgetary parameters are going to be. Coming into 2003 there was no momentum from 2002, which is evidenced from the tax revenue figures. Therefore, the best assessment both locally and internationally is that if there is going to be any recovery it will be in the second half of this year or possibly in 2004. All the evidence shows that the risks are on the down side and that will have to be taken into account when we set our budgetary policies.We are committed to public private partnerships but as regards the earlier question from Deputy Burton, one can see the difficulty she has because private operators receive, what she would call, more than the benefit she thinks they should get.

The initial work involves the establishment of the facts and if this indicates that there are tax liabilities, action will be taken by the Revenue Commissioners to recover the tax together with any interest and penalties.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	587	In response to an earlier question of mine, the Minister disclosed that the Revenue Commissioners know the names of the individuals involved in these offshore schemes in Jersey, which are giving rise to such concern. Will he tell us about the agreement he says is now being reached with the Swiss authorities? According to a recent edition of the Sunday Independent, which carried out an investigation into this particular scheme, wealthy Irish clients with money offshore were queuing up to meet a Swiss bank official who had hired offices in Dublin to relieve their distress. As regards getting information out of Switzerland, the official said: “Ah, that is very, very difficult to get. For us to disclose information is very, very difficult. For us here, it is very unlikely.”

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The Deputy made a suggestion earlier regarding the tax avoidance industry. I have read recent reports by tax experts who say that I am the greatest bane of their lives who has ever become Minister for Finance. It is due to the powers I gave the Revenue Commissioners in 1999 that information relating to these particular trusts has been obtained from the banks. I would wager that most of the money deposited in those trust operations goes back many years, long before my time as Minister for Finance. The Revenue Commissioners have made progress in this regard as a result of the powers I gave them.Regarding the Swiss matter, the taxation on savings directive has been going on in one form or another since the late 1980s, and in its most recent form for the past six years. One of the factors holding up the finalisation of that directive, until the recent trouble over the Italian milk quotas, was the attempt to reach an agreement with non-EU countries about it. It was said at the ECOFIN meetings that many EU countries have major banking industries and if a non-EU neighbour had no reciprocal arrangements with the EU, money would automatically transfer out into that jurisdiction. Negotiations have been going on for a considerable time in the EU and Commissioner Bolkestein has been leading this on our behalf.Steps have been taken by the Swiss authorities to have reciprocal arrangements in certain circumstances and Deputies will have followed the ECOFIN debate in this regard. The Swiss have now agreed to have reciprocal arrangements in fairly tightly controlled circumstances but it is a major breakthrough. The Swiss sought other things in other areas which they have succeeded in obtaining, although not in the area of taxation. If we sign off – hopefully at the ECOFIN meeting next week, if we get the Italian matter resolved – these agreements will operate with the Swiss authorities when the directive comes into play. Under the terms of the agreements, it is intended that if any EU member state has evidence concerning a particular taxpayer, it will be able to obtain information from the Swiss authorities. That will be the situation, which I am pointing out for the benefit of Deputies as well as for people outside the House who may be reading carefully about this.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	593	Is it true that the Revenue Commissioners have written to some of the banks involved with these particular offshore trusts to say that if they indicate by the end of this month that they are willing to come in from the cold and sort out their affairs, penalties, including tax payable, may be mitigated? If this is so, why has the Minister not advertised this more publicly so that the compliant taxpayer can know that his officials are pursuing those involved? These are the people who are robbing our health and education services. They need to be brought back home to pay their fair share of tax, as compliant taxpayers are doing. Will the Minister confirm if the Revenue Commissioners have given people until the end of this month to act?

He referred to the additional powers he gave to the Revenue Commissioners, and undoubtedly he has given them extra powers. Could he update the House on the progress of the review taking place within the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the effectiveness of the use of these powers? The fact that the review is taking place puts a question mark over whether they are being used effectively.

What has happened is that the banks have written to their customers telling them that there is a code of conduct in place. There is a code of practice for auditors for voluntary disclosure. The banks have pointed out to their customers that, under the code of conduct, if they dealt with the Revenue Commissioners at an early stage, depending on the circumstances, they could possibly comply with the mitigation involved in the code of conduct. I understand that the banks have written to their customers. The Revenue's code of conduct for voluntary disclosure has been published for some years. I understand the banks have informed their clients about this way of doing things.

The chairman is a former judge, Mr. Frank Murphy. I have mandated a report by the end of October, if possible. I promised such a review in 1999 during Report Stage of the Finance Bill as a result of the additional powers given to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue powers group will determine whether the powers are adequate or whether they perhaps go too far in particular areas. Many people said the powers I gave Revenue in 1999 were draconian, which is the case compared to the powers in many other jurisdictions.

The national spatial strategy (NSS) provided for a strategic framework for this objective. Because the strategy was not available when the national development plan was prepared, it was explicitly provided that the mid-term review of the plan would take account of the national spatial strategy.Each of the operational programmes is currently subject to independent evaluation and results will become known at the end of August. The results will feed into a high level strategic evaluation of the national development plan which is being conducted by a team led by the ESRI. The NDP mid-term evaluation will focus on common, cross-cutting issues arising from the evaluations of the operational programmes and will assess whether investments across, between and within the different programmes are appropriately aligned towards the achievement of overall national development plan objectives.When the evaluation is completed, the Government will take decisions on any required changes to the strategic focus of the plan and its financial provisions. These decisions will take account of the evaluations, the budgetary outlook and other relevant considerations, including the national spatial strategy.

Is it not the case that there is a big difference between the activities under the national development plan and the objectives under the plan as far as targeting and focusing on delivering a spatial strategy is concerned? Will he not agree that Dublin city, more than anywhere else in the country, needs decentralisation and the development of the regions to try to take pressure off it? I put it to the Minister that currently the designation of a hub town under the spatial strategy is about as useful as being designated a hubcap. For example, under the NDP as it now stands, the NRA is not prepared to invest in regional centres in the midlands, including Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore. There are no plans to put in place investment for the national secondary roads connecting these three towns. There is no rail service connecting Castlebar and Ballina which have a state-of-the-art rail line. Will the Minister give an assurance that the focus will return to the basis of the spatial strategy when the NDP is reviewed?

It will certainly take account of the national spatial strategy. Regarding the level of activity under the national development plan, never in the history of the State has there been such a level of activity. In the operational programme relating to economic infrastructure, the cumulative amount of money to be spent by the end of the year will be approximately €900 million more than the expenditure profile would have allowed when I launched the plan. There are legitimate questions to be asked in some areas as to value for money but it is also true to say that construction inflation was very high during the period of the plan. I am pleased it has evened off as a result of more competition in that whole area. The level of activity going forward is on a scale never before undertaken in the history of the State. If we can keep spending on capital infrastructure at 5% of our gross national product, one will see a massive change in the whole face of Ireland in a period of five years or so.

Is it not the case that the activities taking place at the moment are into and out of Dublin and that under the proposals as they now stand, the only major infrastructural projects going ahead are ones that will be financially viable under public private partnerships? They require masses of population to facilitate that. Basically, the policy is now regional apartheid. In reply to a question yesterday to the Minister for Transport on capital projects under the NDP, there was just one sentence out of a two page reply relating to regional services and the development of regional facilities. Everything is into and out of Dublin, which continues to put the focus on Dublin and contradicts the spatial strategy.

Longford town reminded me of the Klondyke, there was so much activity at the time.The Deputy will be aware that it is not possible to do everything at once. Even if we had unlimited resources it would not be possible. The national development plan, coupled with the national spatial strategy, is a focused approach to how things will be done from now on. I take on board what the Deputy said about decentralisation. I am sure I will please some parts of the country, and displease many more, when the final decisions are made.

Is that part of the review of the national development plan and, if so, will it require fresh legislation to take these steps which were announced extensively by the Minister at the week-end? I am anxious to know if he can sell the Dublin Port tunnel to the National Pension Reserve Fund – Deputy Bruton and I raised the issue on previous occasions – particularly in the context of the height problem for most of the lorries using the port. I know size is an issue at times for the Minister, Deputy Brennan. Has this issue been addressed or is it just another kite? The announcements relating to the sale of the Dublin Port tunnel and the M1 were very interesting. Was the Minister party to these deliberations?

Some time ago he discussed with me an innovative approach he was thinking of adopting regarding the port tunnel, the M1 and other motorways. I signalled to him and his predecessors that one possible approach would be to utilise the assets that have been constructed to fund other projects. The Minister is considering this. It does not necessarily mean that he will involve the National Pensions Reserve Fund.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	612	That is what he said.

I am sure many non-State financial institutions would be willing to offer a good deal in terms of their involvement in this area. The Minister is attempting to utilise some of the assets at his disposal to trigger other moneys which can then be used to add to his infrastructure programme. This would not form part of the national development plan review. The Minister is concerned with getting additional funding outside of his normal budgetary process and using it to fund other works throughout the country.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	615	Deputy Richard Bruton has a particular interest in evaluation and capital appraisal techniques. My Department also has an appraisal unit and there are criteria and guidelines which other Departments should use when assessing projects. That includes the NRA, which comes under the remit of the Department of Transport. My Department is also involved at various stages on the question of evaluation.Many of the problems on over-expenditure on infrastructure projects are rooted in the bad initial cost assessments. I read recently that in proposing projects, many bodies and companies deliberately understate the projected cost because of concern that they would not be attempted if the true estimated cost was disclosed.I have noted the extraordinary projected construction costs for the metro by comparison with the position in other countries. The person from Madrid at the centre of this issue has become famous and people from all parts of the country wish to visit him. If he were to charge fees he would make a fortune. I know the person within the Government framework who discovered him.The person in Madrid is an old style public servant who expects to get value for money by following procedures that were in place in this and other countries, namely keeping a tight control on costs, cutting out the rubbish about consultants, evaluations and so on and getting a bang for his buck. Perhaps we should return to some of these old ways.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18336	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The Minister puts me in mind of a former constituency colleague and a colleague of his who said he was suspicious of anyone who had "major" or "superior" in his or her title.

Does the Minister regret that the national spatial strategy was not introduced before the national development plan, in other words, that the national development plan would be used to deliver the spatial objectives? Will he outline who is guarding the guardians? If he is so suspicious that evaluators put a good gloss on projects, would he not consider asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the issue involved?

Would the Minister consider asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to become involved at an earlier stage to look at the tendering process? His office takes an old style, solid, value for money approach.On the question of selling the port tunnel, is it not the case that there is an EU directive which stipulates that non-tolling routes must be provided in cases where tolling is imposed?

When the national development plan was being compiled, work on the national spatial strategy was ongoing. It was clear that if we waited for the completion of the strategy, the national development plan would not be launched on time. The national spatial strategy was launched some months ago while the NDP was launched in 1999.The Comptroller and Auditor General plays a very important role but we cannot ask him to scrutinise every financial project.

Social partnership should not merely embrace the interests of those at the negotiating table. There is little doubt that the poor need clout and influence to address the untenable social conditions which are constantly being endured by those unfortunate enough to be on the fringes of society. Accordingly, in recent years the main voices raised in their support have been CORI and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed.Partnership should be about the whole community and, in particular, those who are in need of special consideration. In the context of social partnership, an opportunity existed to address the problem of unemployment, which the previous Government refrained from taking. Nevertheless, the gap between the rich and poor continues to widen and, even though evidence of unprecedented gains in wealth are visible throughout the country, the poor continue to be with us.Unfortunately, the Celtic tiger has a soft under-belly in that social exclusion was, and continues to be, experienced, by large numbers of people and long-term unemployment is rife in urban black spots Waiting lists for housing are growing at an alarming rate, soaring property prices are putting homes out of people's reach and major issues of equality, health care, disability and environment have yet to be addressed. The case for the redistribution of wealth and a more even balance in Ireland's social equilibrium is irresistible.Before last year's general election, the Taoiseach said that one of the Government's main objectives in the national anti-poverty strategy was to reduce consistent poverty to 2% and ideally to eliminate it, together with the elimination of long-term unemployment, by 2007. With that policy in ruins, the establishment of a new National Economic and Social Development Office is timely if it serves to improve the lot of the marginalised in our society.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	625	This Bill is about developing and enhancing the capacity of three bodies, the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Economic and Social Council and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, which are coming together in the National Economic and Social Development Office to advise the Government on measures which can fulfil Ireland's need for innovation, competitiveness and inclusion.The National Economic and Social Forum was established to contribute to the formation of a wider national consensus on social and economic policy initiatives, particularly regarding employment. I ask the Minister what it has done for the west. The answer is very little. In Mayo a sad situation is happening today. We have had some terribly sad scenes in Mayo in the past, including the Famine and everything else. Today, juggernauts packed with machinery are leaving the unemployment blackspot of Ballinrobe in that county. With the departure of those trucks go the hopes, dreams and aspirations of thousands of people in the Ballinrobe area. Some 75 jobs were promised over the next four years, with 25 jobs to start next month, but that is not to be. It was supposed to be a manufacturing facility to produce silicone housing for sports cars. The factory has been vacant for 20 years, and that represents 20 years of neglect and failure on the part of successive Governments to find employment for the people of Ballinrobe.The Welsh company that decided to pack up could not hold on any more. It had done so to date because it thought that something would happen. It says that it is not getting enough money from the IDA to allow it to go ahead. It had hoped that something was going to happen by today. I hear that the IDA is paying €100,000 per annum for an empty factory. It says that it can offer no more because it is not possible under EU law. However, where has all that money that came from the EU in the form of Structural Funds gone? It has certainly not gone west, for we do not have the roads, the infrastructure or the telecommunications.Those people going on the dole would otherwise have been employed and off the dole. Half of our graduates will have to go to Dublin to get their first jobs, and that is ridiculous. Is it not time to shout stop? What will this Bill do for Ballinrobe? So much for balanced regional development and the national spatial strategy – what do they mean? Half the population of Ireland is in the Dublin commuter area. The CSO is setting off alarm bells about this. Dublin is so congested, and the traffic is so slow that it seems about to stop, having only the pace of an ass and cart. It takes three hours for people in Dublin to get to and from work. Where will it stop? Is it not time that something was done for Ballinrobe? Is it not time that those partners who are supposed to be so powerful – the Government, the unions and the others – did something for County Mayo?The partnership is doing little for Ballinrobe. Is it not time that something was done? Where is the Government's commitment to our county? Gas is going out from Mayo with no commitment to any town in it. Is that balanced regional development? Where is the hope for our future? Instead we have despair in the worst socio-economic area in Ireland, something well recognised by Dr. Seamus Caulfield. In that area we need a tax incentive scheme. The Minister for Finance was there a moment ago. I will ask him whether it is not time that we get a tax incentive scheme in Mayo. The gas will leave our county. By the grace of Almighty God, we have all that wealth off our shore, but it will not help us in Mayo, for we will not even get a smell of it. It is truly an Irish joke. Is it not time that we called a halt to what is happening?Objective One status means nothing unless one is getting grants. What good are higher grants if one is not receiving them in the first place? We are not getting them. Is it not time for the Government to recognise that one part of Ireland is so developed, with so many people, that it is falling into the sea and say that enough is enough, not giving any more grants to industries in Dublin but concentrating them on the west and the people who need grants, infrastructure and roads? However, we know from the national development plan that it is not happening, for our centralised Government does not give a damn about the west. It is time that it did.The juggernauts are leaving Mayo today. Is it not time to put a halt to that? I appeal to the Government to do something about a tax incentive scheme for Mayo. We have gas and wind power. Let us go the whole hog and do something for our area, being logical. The NESDO could do all that. If there is a will, there is a way, so let us shout stop and hope that the Government is listening.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaí neamhspleách as a chuid ama a roinnt. Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom a rá, ó thaobh an Bhille um an Oifig Náisiúnta d'Fhorbairt Eacnamaíoch agus Shóisialach 2002 de, gur droch-chéim é, mar tá sé ag gearradh siar ar na heagraíochtaí atá bunaithe chun smaointe nua agus tábhachtacha a iniúchadh, a fhorbairt agus a chur ar aghaidh mar pholasaithe Rialtais.This Bill is regressive in that it cuts back on bodies that are there to be innovative in how they respond to major issues in society. Social inclusion is set out as one of the objectives in the establishment of this new office, but to bring that about requires far more radical policy changes than are currently under way from this Government. There has been much talk about social inclusion. It has become a verbal stick for parties to beat each other about the head with, regarding who is more involved or more interested in social inclusion. However, it is unfortunately a long way from becoming a reality. Although the policy talks of the need to achieve greater equality and social inclusion, the reality is that we are living in a society where the gap between rich and poor is growing. Of the 17 industrialised countries, the United Nations human development report ranks Ireland sixteenth on the poverty index. Only the USA was worse, with the UK not much better, in fifteenth position. Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands have the lowest levels of poverty.The report used variables that do not get a look-in in the terminology of our economic measurements. The UN was not merely looking at GDP or GNP but at the percentages of people likely to die before they were 60, who were functionally illiterate, who had disposable incomes less that 50% of the median, or who had been unemployed for more than a year. In reality, those criteria should be part of our daily economic measurements in the same way as GDP, being announced in parallel so that we can have a more realistic measurement and avoid getting ourselves into the problems of gross inequality which is currently the case.The Celtic tiger has been mentioned by previous speakers, and there were rising numbers of jobs, although that has turned around now. However, the number of people living in relative income poverty is still rising steadily, now standing at over 20%, compared with 17.4% in 1994. That is a shameful reality for a country that boasts of its economic performance, maintaining that its economy is the envy of other countries. That is not the case if one is affected by the levels of poverty indicated by those figures.There is no doubt that poor people do not have enough income to provide for basic necessities. Almost six out of every ten people living in relative poverty are in a household headed by a person not in the labour force, either retired, ill, with a disability or on home duties. Failure to raise social welfare payments in line with improving living standards is a major factor in those groups being in poverty. The gap in disposable incomes between a person earning over €50,000 and a long-term unemployed person was widened by €243 a week by the present Government during its first term in office. Other impacts on poverty – two-tier health care, housing waiting lists, low pay and persistent educational disadvantage – all mean that the Government needs the organisations that it is considering amalgamating into one through this Bill. In the face of those problems, it is a backward step to try to hide them away under the remit of one office. The problems need considerably more resources than are currently being made available and that needs to be changed through our tax system. I realise that the Government would have to get the money from somewhere but at the moment those on very high incomes are benefiting most from the policies that are in place.We have debated but not acted on the issue of establishing a radical review of our tax and social welfare system. I acknowledge that there has been more integration of the tax and social welfare systems but it has stopped short of its logical conclusion which is to put in some form of guaranteed basic income so that people might be recognised and valued as members of society in their own right, not unlike shareholders in a company. We might call it Ireland Inc. but in this case it means that somebody is being valued and it recognises the nature of the labour market which involves changes in employment from job to job, more than in previous times. It also recognises the need for somebody to have some stable income when that person does voluntary work, home care, parenting, caring for the elderly and so forth. That issue needs to be revisited. The Government has looked at it and produced a report on it and I call on those involved in, and appointed to, this office to act on it. The choice between the basic income system and the conventional tax welfare options is a trade-off between greater equity and a possible risk of slightly lower economic growth. However, that can be contrasted with the current situation where economic growth is the absolute goal and less equity is therefore unfortunately a result. At a time when so much concern is expressed about the country's failure to use its recent economic growth to build a fairer society, the argument in favour of introducing a basic income is further strengthened. I ask the Government to look at that seriously.The social partnership model has achieved a certain amount – although we do not know what might have been had it not been there. We suspect that there would have been greater social unrest – although it has failed to deliver on its promise of social inclusion and prosperity for all as evidenced by the figures.There is an additional looming problem that I will talk about again because I do not think the Government hears it. Apart from its preoccupation with the current growth model, which hides a reality in that it measures only spending, the Government needs to put in place quality of life indicators. Ironically, because it does not have these, the devastation and tragedy of people losing their lives in car accidents as documented on a recent television programme, "Crash", is measured as a benefit in the economic system. This is because it involves increased spending, replacing a car, increased health costs, even the cost of funerals which is regarded as a benefit to GDP. That is perverse. Likewise, the more people who are sick the more money needs to be spent and that is a boost to GDP as well. We import €100 million worth of oil which is money leaving the country but it counts as expenditure and therefore is measured as GDP benefit.That brings me to a final point because social partnership is blind in not realising that by 2010 there is going to be an international peak in oil production. This country is over 90% dependent on oil imports but we have no control over the price of oil. This is the view of the petrologists, Dr. Colin Campbell and Hamish McRae, who have warned of 2010 as a time when there will be a peak in production. Currently, for every five barrels consumed only three are found to replace them and we are in for considerable oil shocks which will affect us more perhaps than any country to which we compare ourselves.On top of that we have the budgetary land mine of the Kyoto Protocol kicking in. According to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, that will cost us €1.3 billion per annum. Let us put people with an environmental qualification into the partnership process so that we can really plan for the future rather than trying to avoid this elephant in the middle of the sitting room, which is the attitude at the moment. This is not just a case of climate change, of the Taoiseach in his wellingtons in the floods in Drumcondra or of its effects on the many people in poorer countries already affected by it. This is about minding our budgetary situation responsibly otherwise we will end up paying the UK for emissions trading, paying Germany, Denmark and those countries that are more responsible and organised in dealing with their environmental responsibilities. I ask that social partnership realises that it is missing a vital link in its operation if it does not have environmental representatives around the table. That is a mistake and it is going to cost us dearly in many ways, particularly financially. My wish for this Bill is that the Government, if it does pass it and it probably will, would recognise that social partnership needs to include environmental expertise in the next round.

Now, on top of the NESF, the NESC and the NCPP we have the NESDO. For ordinary citizens and for many legislators this mushrooming of acronyms is bewildering. However, these bodies do useful work, especially in researching and evaluating Government policies and strategies.Sections 8, 9 and 10 set out worthy objectives. The new office will advise the Taoiseach on strategic matters relevant to economic and social development. The NESC will report to the Taoiseach on the efficient development of the economy and the achievement of social justice. The NESF will advise the Taoiseach on policies to achieve greater equality and social inclusion, all in the context of social partnership.While these are worthy objectives they cannot be taken at face value without looking at the recent record of this Government regarding NESF and NESC reports presented to it. Take, for example, the NESF report on equality of access to hospital care. This was a revealing report which clearly demonstrates the failure of this Government's health policy. The NESF report states that structural change is necessary to address the two-tier public/private system in hospital care and most significantly it states that this system is left unchanged in the Government's health strategy. The harsh reality behind the statistics is that elderly people, children and people with disabilities who depend on the public system wait for months or years in pain and distress while those who can afford expensive private care can receive it almost at once.The NESF report shows that private use of public hospitals is much greater in this State than in other EU States. It highlights the inequity between public and private patients in the waiting times for initial specialist appointments. The Government's health strategy makes no reference to the time spent waiting for the first consultant appointment after referral by a GP. One of the most serious aspects of the NESF report is the fact that it calls into question the Government's waiting list initiatives. It points out that there has been no formal evaluation of the value of these initiatives and questions the criteria for evaluating patients in order of their clinical priority. These are important points. It is imperative that the Government heeds the recommendations and findings of the work of these bodies. We are dealing with legislation that rightly lauds and applauds that work, but the Government is ignoring much of the work presented by these important bodies.What has happened to that NESF report? Since it was published we have seen the crisis in our health services deepen and have also seen the public-private division in those services widen. The deterioration in the public system is forcing people into the private system, people who cannot afford to access the private system but who are being forced, out of health care considerations, to end up in quite serious financial circumstances, unquestionably borrowing in order to meet the quite high demands of private health care companies in this country. The main concern they have is for their own health and for the health of their families. We must recognise that as a fact of life.The Government should have taken the NESF report more seriously, most especially reflecting, as it does, the call from the vast majority of people – this must have been noted by all elected opinion – in this country that they want to see an end to the class division in the provision of health care. The NESF report focused very particularly on all of that. It made it absolutely clear that the Government's health strategy must be radically changed. I join in that recommendation.What has happened to the report? Is it lying on a shelf and will it be joined by other major reports on health, including perhaps the Brennan report, which was mentioned earlier and of which the Government is also in possession, as are members of the media, but not this Deputy? It is important, therefore, in addressing this Bill to address the Government's failure to listen to the NESC and the NESF in the past. There is no commitment in any of the commentary from Government or in the Bill before us to change the stance that Government has taken heretofore.The second report to which I want to refer is the National Economic and Social Council report entitled An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise which was published around the same time as the Government's spatial strategy. While the spatial strategy report is looking towards a bright future and praising past achievements, the NESC report, on the other hand, paints a very different picture and a past littered with failures. It states that Ireland is currently facing an infrastructural deficit, identifiable through the absence of a road network of sufficient quality to link major settlements, the possibility of future electricity generation shortages and a low level of communications connectivity within the country. The report refers back to the NESC 1999 strategy report which identified five areas of crucial importance in Ireland's infrastructural deficit. These were housing, public transport, roads, culture and recreational infrastructure and telecommunications infrastructure. The NESC has since added two further priority areas to that list – energy and waste management – bringing the number from five to seven.This report is in sharp and distinct contrast to the Government's spatial strategy report which, in its conclusions, includes much self-praise. It states that the remarkable transformation of the Irish economy in the last decade came about because crucial, strategic, long-term and far-sighted policies were put in place. The NESC report is clearly in direct contravention of that claim. It is not good enough to move towards the establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office and its three important component parts – I focused particularly on the NESF and the NESC – and to ignore the industry, work and report findings presented by these earnest bodies, which I hold in high regard and respect as does the overwhelming body of our citizenry. I strongly urge new thinking and respect for the productivity of these bodies on the part of Government.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The National Economic and Social Development Office Bill emphasises the Government's continued strong commitment to pursuing our nation's well-being and prosperity through the process of social dialogue by putting in place, on a statutory basis, the key institutional framework that underpins the social partnership process.The series of agreements we have had since 1987 have played a very significant role in the radical transformation of our country's economic and social fortunes in the recent past. The latest agreement, Sustaining Progress, provides the environment that will allow us to take advantage of the upturn in the world economy when it comes and to continue to progress economically and socially. In the agreement that has been ratified by the social partners, we see a focus not only on wages and the labour market, but a continued framework for consistent policies to regain our competitiveness and our productive capacity, while also progressing our social agenda.Sustaining Progress also seeks to engage Government and the social partners in a new and dynamic way on a range of special initiatives, which have a high priority in terms of social inclusion and quality of life. Together, we can make real progress in areas such as housing, homelessness, child poverty, literacy, early school leaving and improved infrastructure. Within Sustaining Progress it is clear that we now have a coherent and well developed policy framework to progress the issues of national importance. The priority now must be to secure progress on implementation.The new office, the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, and the three constituent bodies, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic andSocial Forum and the more recently established National Centre for Partnership and Performance provide an institutional framework to support the implementation of Sustaining Progress while also examining the more medium-term strategic issues that Ireland will need to address as a society moving forward.That the social partners are continuously engaged in this framework provides a basis not only for achieving consensus but for ensuring implementation. Perhaps the most enduring feature of social partnership agreements has been their ability to evolve and adapt to address emerging economic and social needs. In Sustaining Progress the Government and the social partners have attached a central importance to the ten special initiatives on the basis that all are major cross-cutting issues that require the mobilisation of a range of resources across sectors, organisations and individuals at different levels of Government.The new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, also recognises the importance of deepening partnership and improving performance in the workplace and the key role the National Centre for Partnership and Performance has to play in supporting this. Good progress has been made in carrying forward the work of the centre which published its strategy and operational plan for 2002 to 2005 in March last year.Preparations for the establishment later this year of the forum on the workplace of the future are well advanced. A consultation paper is being prepared setting out the main themes for discussion at the forum and a survey is about to be conducted of employee attitudes to changes in the workplace, their experiences in the workplace and their expectations in respect of a future workplace. A similar survey of employer attitudes is also planned. The consultation paper and survey will help focus the work of the forum. The Government attaches particular importance to the establishment of the forum and will facilitate in-depth discussions on how workplaces can best adapt to competitive pressures, improve the delivery of services and respond to the changing needs and preferences of employees. This, in turn, will enable us to take a holistic approach to improving partnership and performance in the workplace in both public and private sectors.In addition to creating a vision of the high performing workplaces of the future, the NCPP is tasked with developing models of good practice and promoting the benefits of the partnership approach. Examples of the centre's activities in this area include the preparation of best practice guidelines for the Civil Service following on from a seminar in Dublin Castle in February and a consultative workshop held on 2 May. This will complement the guidelines for companies involved in change through partnership which were published last July. The centre is also finalising prior to publication, a major review of international as well as Irish studies establishing the benefits of the partnership approach.As well as this type of promotional activity, the NCPP has been engaged in developing tools to assist organisations in managing change through partnership. Last March the centre launched a competency framework designed to help organisations attract and develop highly skilled and motivated employees. In April the centre launched the learning by monitoring project which is designed to support organisations in developing partnerships into something integral to the way they do business rather than something they simply do. The centre is also continuing with the development of an interactive website to help organisations, agencies and individuals in the private and public sectors in undertaking change through partnership.The NCPP's work has the potential to make a significant contribution to organisational change and modernisation in the years ahead. I commend the centre on the progress it has made to date in carrying out its remit and call on employers and employees in the private and public sectors to listen to what the centre says, apply it to their workplaces and embrace change as the key to the continuing development of our society and economy.

Don chéad uair, cuirfear struchtúr ceart ar dul chun cinn agus ar na grúpanna éagsúla a bhfuil baint acu leis agus le feabhas sóisialta agus fás eacnamaíochta. Tá sé sin riachtanach.I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Ministers involved in bringing the Bill to the Dáil. The National Economic and Social Development Office will comprise three bodies: the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. It may include other bodies from time to time as the Government of the day decides.Good government in a democracy depends inherently on different groups within society having expression given to their hopes and aspirations by way of politicians. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on his comprehensive speech in which he included reports of negotiations at different levels. That is the subject matter of the legislation. It will become an umbrella group of statutory importance which recognises and places in law the role different constituent bodies have played in aiding economic growth and the achievement of social justice. I know politicians from every party would have that aspiration and none of us will ever be happy that we have achieved Utopia. The Bill at least allows a recognition of how we go about that.The new umbrella group, because of the constituent bodies involved, will allow for a review of economic performance. It will help analyse and report strategic issues and, it is hoped, achieve economic progress and social justice. For me as a new TD, all these things are very important, especially social justice.Having spent many years in teaching, I compliment the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for making €42 million more available to assist people from poorer and socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds to access third level education. For too long, that area has been denied to too many and the increases that those of every colour in politics would have liked to have seen were not achieved. I hope the €42 million will go some way towards achieving a level of social justice for these people.I also congratulate the Taoiseach because he has been exemplary in recognising the need for team work. I do not aspire to a specific ideology. For me, the different players in economic growth, be they entrepreneurs, workers, the unemployed or civil servants, must be brought together if we, as a small economy, are to continue to achieve the levels of economic success we achieved in recent years. Maintaining that is the challenge of the future. Under the terms of the Bill, the council will continue to have functions of analysing and reporting on our progress.I direct attention to the Taoiseach's recent comment that the new umbrella group will add value to the work of its constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which synergy can be released, joint projects pursued and the potential for duplication minimised. That potential has existed before and different groups may have attempted to reach the same aims. I think we would agree that duplication has occurred.The NESDO will promote the development of a shared vision for meeting goals and targets. It will encourage the three constituent organisations to optimise their influence and effectiveness and adopt a collaborative policy. For this reason, this is one of the more important Bills that will come before the Dáil. Who are the main players? Employers, civil servants, entrepreneurs and workers are all important as are groups that have sometimes been unrepresented, such as the unemployed.I can summarise my ideology by saying that if we are to help the poor it can only be done by allowing entrepreneurs to make money, otherwise money will not be there. This is where partnership comes into play. Without partnership Ireland would not have achieved the levels it has reached in recent years.I return to pre-partnership days. In the bad old days of 1987 the International Monetary Fund was circling our economy. The series of national partnership agreements, beginning with the Programme for National Recovery in 1987, have made a major contribution to our success. The agreements brought together the Government, employers, trade unions, farmers and representatives of civil society. To appreciate the effect social partnership has had we can look back to 1987. In 1987, the debt to gross domestic productivity ratio had risen to almost 117%. Our overall gross domestic productivity  per capita at that time was around 70% of the EU average. Ireland and our European partners saw the economy as being peripheral and suffering due to its distance from the centre of European market activity.The NESDO is about facilitating partnership. It is about Government not acting in a dictatorial way, but representing the interests and needs of those that elect us to this House. Growth averaged 7% per annum in the period 1999-2001, peaking at 11% in 2000. There has been a rapid rise in the rate of female participation in our economy and women have become an important driving force in it. This is one of the advantages of this umbrella as it allows for areas to be represented in different ways and for various groups to be represented.Partnership and the NESDO must promote local and community enterprise. I will be delighted to launch an enterprise centre project in Taghmon, County Wexford, tomorrow night. We must recognise the need for communities to come together. Partnership reminds me of the Gaelic word "meitheal". Meitheal was best exemplified by the threshing days of old. The threshing machine would arrive and the local farmers exercised their different skills in reaping the harvest for the farmer whose threshing day it was. This is what partnership is about. It is about responding to the needs of many different people.The Taoiseach has proven to be an able leader in bringing together the different groups and in organising team play. The challenges we now face probably result from the economic growth we have had that has resulted in infrastructural bottlenecks on our railways and particularly our roads. The challenge for the NESDO will be in addressing this. It must also seek to improve access to hospitals and the take up of third level education by socio-economically disadvantaged groups.I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, and the Minister, Deputy Harney, on the redundancy payments Bill. I see this as a real exercise in partnership. It is an exercise in representing what is sometimes termed "human capital". In the old economic textbooks, the factors of production were seen as land, labour, capital and enterprise. Human capital was not often recognised. While entrepreneurs were recognised, workers were not. I am glad the redundancy Bill gives some recognition to workers that are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs.I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on his efforts at insurance reform. We all need to work together to make sure the difficulties people face in acquiring insurance and paying increasing premiums are tackled in a sincere way. I am glad to see that the premiums for road insurance may come down because of the penalty points system.Ní neart go cur le chéile. Ligeann an Bille dúinn agus tugann sé seans dúinn teacht le chéile chun feabhas eacnamaíochta agus fás sóisialta a chur chun tús agus chun na cuspóirí atá ag gach uile polaiteoir a gcur i gcrích. Caithfimid an plean a chur i gcrích chun an todhchaí a láimhseáil.The challenge for the NESDO will be more a challenge for the future than looking to the past. The long-term unemployed, women and others who have previously had little expectation of finding meaningful well-paid work have been able to play their role because of partnership. Partnership has produced tangible rewards for ordinary people. The tax burden has been reduced, particularly for the PAYE worker. While it may not have been reduced by as much as I and other Members would like, nonetheless, it has been reduced. Social housing has also been put in place.The developments have come about because of partnership. The onus is now on elected representatives to ensure we improve social justice and economic activity. I believe the NESDO is the way forward. Gabhaim buíochas leat, a Cheann Comhairle, agus tá áthas orm cabhrú leis an mBille a chur os cómhair na Dála.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. When looking at the development of partnership one must look at cultural, economic, political and social issues. Regrettably, we are going back to the future and returning to 1992. One could judge the success of partnership as having the world's best health care, education system, housing and welfare. We have failed dismally in each of those categories. In many ways, the boom has been wasted. The health system is in disarray, our housing policy is one of the worst in Europe and it is hard to see the effectiveness of partnership if one were to adjudicate on the current economic and social well-being of the country.The Government has to seek to achieve value for money. There is a huge tax take in the State and we must ask how effectively is that money being spent on our public services. Is the consumer getting value for money? We often hear talk of competitiveness. It is important that we have a competitive public sector. When one sees the Estimate voted in the Dáil for each Department and the huge waste in the economy, one can see that this problem needs to be addressed. There are very few people who can effectively police this to ensure that taxpayers are getting effective value for money. There is huge waste. Although the health budget alone is €9 billion, waiting lists have become longer and the level of satisfaction with the service is evident from last week's opinion polls. It is unbelievable that this has been allowed to happen through mismanagement.We need a clear political vision for the future. It is important that we have very strong leadership to make the hard decisions required to save the economy. We hear about inflation and how Ireland is now the second most expensive country in Europe in which to live. There is no point in resting on our laurels; we must be very careful in the future to pay heed to the lessons we learned in 1992 when it comes to direct taxation. VAT has come down, as have the numbers of people employed in private enterprise. It is important that recognition is given to private enterprise, which was quite excluded in this deal. The small firms have a seat at the partnership table, but the people who take risks are under-represented. We cannot redistribute wealth unless we take it in. We should take into account the current tax intake. Some people who took risks were not given any credit but were penalised in many ways. It is very important that the clear message from partnership is that risk-takers will be rewarded. This should be promoted.The whole economic well-being of the country can be affected by cultural diversity in the economy. As a nation, we must be much more tolerant. At the moment we are not tolerant enough. The enlargement of Europe will have a huge impact on this country in the future. It should be considered in terms of redistribution of wealth and the level of cultural diversity. We need a clear vision and we need more tolerance. We are developing a culture of welfare dependency and we should be careful about this. It is a question of how it is promoted. Obviously, there is a huge welfare obligation for people who are in need, but private enterprise and the concept of partnership has been effective.Fine Gael welcomes this Bill. It will provide a statutory foundation for three bodies who have played a vital role in ensuring that the process of partnership worked well and helped the economy grow and prosper. It was very easy to do this during the good times of the Celtic tiger, when there was a massive amount of spending. Now, however, the economy is different. The special savings incentive scheme is taking money out of the economy. That scheme was definitely geared towards a different time. The system is taking money from the economy because people are not spending it. They are locked into the scheme because they will be penalised if they leave it.Fine Gael has always believed in the principle of partnership. From the time of the Tallaght strategy that the party adopted in the late 1980s, through the rainbow Government led by Deputy John Bruton and to the present day, we saw that co-operation and consensus was the only way to go to ensure that we would be spared the industrial strife and tension that could so easily relegate us to the status of economic basket case. Looking back over our history, for example in 1987 and 1992, we have sometimes not been far from such a situation.Looking at the voted Estimates for each Department, the level of taxation and the huge commitments agreed to by the State, it can be seen that we need careful management over the next few years. There is benchmarking and additional costs as well as the high expectations created by the Government in its lead-in to the partnership deal. It said we would never see a poor day again, that we should get out the bottles of champagne, that we should let the good times roll, so it is hard to come back and tell people that things have changed. The success of partnership is decided by how it is sold to people. People judge its success when they are on hospital waiting lists and when they see schools that are clearly disadvantaged and cutbacks in every Department. It is hard in times such as these to sell the message advocated by the Taoiseach that we have one of the best economies in Europe. The level of unrest is due to pressure on people who are obliged to live on two incomes to pay for housing, for example, the price of which is affected by inflation.The first partnership agreement was in 1987. Even the name, the Programme for National Recovery, signalled the mess we were in at the time and indicates the level of spending in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Now we have Sustaining Progress, but this programme does not maintain what we have. It is difficult to do so. In the past five years, during the last Government, spending was at such a high level that people find the new arrangements very hard to take. When there has been a massive spend of 35% to 40% above the usual level, it is hard to bring people back to a modest 10% or 12%. A better name for the programme would be "Telling it as it is."  In the lead-up to the last election the figures were so mind-boggling that people clearly did not know what was really happening in the economy, including the need for serious cutbacks. In 2001, €2.5 billion in revenue was left over. A total of €50 million per week was coming into the cash tills of the economy in 2001 and people knew this. Even taking into account current economic trends, the cash intake is considerably less than was initially projected.We must also consider the level of borrowing within the State and the infrastructural deficit. The national development plan and the new health strategy document were launched recently. We must tell people the truth. They will respect us more for it. The Government has a huge obligation to let people in partnership know that the cash intake is not so good. How is the national development plan to be funded? There is no point in building up people's hopes for a huge amount of spending.Partnership should be tempered with an understanding that the institutions in which we place our trust for economic growth must continually evolve so they can meet the needs of the economy. There are huge changes in the economy at the moment. Ireland is changing; unemployment has fallen, but the pressure is still huge. The Minister will be aware that a year or two ago, thousands of people were receiving work permits. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has changed the system only in recent weeks, but there is still a skills shortage. The downturn in the private sector and the tourism sector means that by all indications it will be a confined market. Consumer spending has certainly reduced – I know this from talking to people in the trade. This is true even in the vintners' trade. Many places are extremely quiet mid-week. We heard an announcement about closing time on a Thursday night – but very few people are out on a Thursday night anyway. Real change will hit at the weekend when most people visit licensed premises.There are many more women in the workforce; emigration has been replaced with inward migration. These are all welcome developments, but the partnership model does not seem to have noticed these sweeping changes, which are important. We must remember that the success of this economy has been dependent on small companies who employ 10 people or fewer. They took a huge risk and have not received any recognition from the State. They built their success on taking this risk.As we debate this Bill, it is worth considering whether this partnership is in need of a refit. It was effective in the 1980s and 1990s but we are in a different era now. It was originally intended to be inclusive in practical and difficult economic times. Such times are again emerging and it is important we examine the role of enterprise, small companies and the marginalised in our economy. It is hard to sell partnership to people on low incomes. While we have introduced a minimum wage, it is wrong that such wages are taxed. We must look again at our taxation levels. We have a new poor in this country such as those who are trying to educate their families. I welcome the Minister's attempts to increase benefits for those in receipt of the minimum wage. The system of basing educational entitlements on a person's gross salary is an unfair one. There can be a considerable difference between what people get in their gross and net salaries. This area must be looked at again.This deal is now somewhat exclusive and outdated. Televising people going into Government Buildings for talks means nothing to those who find it difficult to educate their children and are on hospital waiting lists for treatment. The partnership will be judged on the economic well-being of this country, its cultural diversity, political leadership, which is lacking, and the social challenges facing us. We are going back to the future, back to 1992 when a new form of management existed. Inflation was low in 1995-97. We are now dealing with high inflation and looking at ways of dealing with it. Our insurance costs are also high. People are focusing on the soft touches in relation to reducing inflation. We are faced with the Government's inability to deal with the high cost of doing business in this State. Examples were given earlier of the situation in other European countries. We are faced with an unequal playing field in terms of doing business in this economy.Industrialists coming to Ireland are facing the stacked up costs of employing people here. PAYE and PRSI contributions provide a massive contribution to the State. The Government's take per salary is considerable. We must provide incentives for employers who are prepared to take risks in business. This partnership has not given credit to the risk takers. One cannot redistribute wealth unless it is generated. I am concerned at the level of indirect taxation and value added tax. The take from value added tax has reduced considerably.Everyone is aware that costs are rising. I have spoken to my colleague, Deputy Hogan, on numerous occasions about enterprise and trade. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy. The most successful companies in the State are those which employ fewer than ten people. Yet no arm of the State provides incentives for them. In regard to enterprise boards, a total budget of €24 million is allocated for 26 boards, effectively allowing them to deal only with administration, and they have little resources for grants and so on. Small firms receive no incentives but have to deal with a great deal of red tape. Far from encouraging local enterprise, this process will erode it. The number of community-based economic partnerships has fallen. Small businesses benefit from not having the industrial relations problems faced by larger firms.We are dealing with a competitive market and the valuation of currency in Europe is placing enormous pressure on exports. Despite our progress in more recent times, Ireland still has poor infrastructure. We are becoming a high cost country. We have all heard of the difficulties experienced on the east coast. Border counties on the west coast are also experiencing difficulties doing business. IDA Ireland has, in the past, encouraged multinationals to set up business in Ireland. Such companies used to ask, "Why should we set up in Ireland? That question soon changed to "Why are we not in Ireland?"  The question now is, "Can we afford to stay in Ireland?"  We have reached a crossroads in our economic and industrial history.Fine Gael welcomes this Bill but we cannot continue believing that the current model of partnership is conducive to a vibrant economy. I do not think we have a buoyant jobs market or a sustainable future. It is time for change. The partnership talks should not be focused in Government Buildings, they should take place in the regions among the people discussing with them how effective the partnership has been and what it means to those on low salaries and those on hospital waiting lists. People view this partnership as for somebody else. We have all heard of the benchmarking review and the cost to the Exchequer, for which the State has not yet made provision. Partnership in local authorities and communities has been excluded, as it has in small enterprise – I have experience of this and those who take risks get little or nothing in return. Such people often work a 40-hour weekend rather than a 40-hour week.We must examine the role of private enterprise. Another area which provides value for money – I am involved in it – is the area of public accounts. It is critically important that we provide a competitive public service. We have all heard of competitive partnership. It is important that the State, our biggest employer, provides effective services and value for money. There is enormous waste in every Department with unnecessary duplication and over-staffing. These issues drastically affect the effectiveness of the service. It is outrageous that there is no accountability among the thousands of people employed by the State. I doubt if anyone has ever been sacked from the public service for not doing his or her job. People in private enterprise who do not do their job get their P45 very quickly. That is how private enterprise works. We must seek more accountability in the public sector.I am delighted to have contributed to this debate. We need to re-examine partnership in the context of where we are now. We are, regrettably, back to where we were ten years ago. Fine Gael left the State in good shape in 1997 but, regrettably, it is now in deficit. Those at the lower end of the economic scale deserve better in terms of partnership. The outlook for them is exceedingly bleak. I appeal to the Minister to look after the less well-off who have not benefited to date.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	635	Deputy Perry made a very interesting contribution. This debate is about social partnership. I am particularly pleased to have served as a Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the previous Government as labour, trade and consumer affairs Minister. Deputy Perry and I had many discussions during that time, at committee level and in this Chamber. There is no doubt in my mind. I agree with the approach in some of the ideas to which he alluded, regarding a partnership at grass root level ensuring that those have been excluded are brought into the process. One of the great successes of partnership, by its nature, is that it is flexible.I hope the powers that be, and this new National Economic and Social Development Office, are listening carefully to this debate and will take account of the many important points made, including Deputy Perry's. No doubt the Taoiseach will agree this is an important debate and it is certainly one in which I am glad to be involved.The Taoiseach outlined the purpose of this Bill, which is to establish the National Economic and Social Development Office. That is an important development but the debate is about social partnership. The Taoiseach outlined the political, social and economic context for the establishment of this office. Deputy Perry also mentioned that we are living in changing times. We are living in changing times, with the global economy changing dramatically on almost a weekly basis. We were never more in need of a robust partnership process and those involved in the process, including the Government, should be willing to look at the need to be flexible on that very issue. Therefore I welcome some of the points which have been made.Successive partnership agreements negotiated by governments since 1987 have sown the seeds for exponential growth in the Irish economy over more than a decade, and this same partnership between government, employers, trades unions and representatives of the agricultural sector have ensured that as the economic climate became more overcast, our economy has been well placed to withstand the worst effects of a global slowdown. In short, social partnership has served Ireland well over 15 years.Engagement with the social partners has made a significant contribution to the formulation of economic and social policy in that time and, in doing so, has allowed Ireland to follow the European social model that has always promoted such a partnership engagement. It is an engagement, to which I have a strong attachment especially during my term as Minister of State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and which I have had no hesitation in advocating as the primary means to developing not only a strong and vibrant economy, but a fair, just and caring society.Since 1987 the partnership agreements have become more sophisticated, more inclusive, and have embraced a wider economic and social agenda. Our system of partnership is the envy of many of our EU partners. We have, effectively, a unique system of running our affairs on issues such as unemployment, inequality, social inclusion as well as incomes policy and this approach has expanded over the year.We have also been determined to broaden our approach to see how we can do things better. A very exciting development has been the third strand feeding into the National Economic and Social Development Office, that is, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. This centre was launched last year with a remit of driving change in the workplace. Its job is to look at the workplace of the future to support and facilitate organisational change based on partnership.I am convinced that much work needs to be done on issues like management systems, human resources, how people are treated in the workplace, the very serious problem of bullying which I endeavoured to address during my time as Minister for Labour. Health and safety in the workplace is too often seen in merely physical terms. It is obviously essential that workers are provided with proper safety equipment, that the physical environment in which they work is safe and secure, but I hold that it is of equal importance that they are treated with respect and dignity when they go to work. When it comes to dealing with workplace issues the psycho-social environment is just as important as the physical environment. Ensuring a healthy working environment is not just a crucial health and safety prerogative for management, but it is a very important business issue. A well-treated and respected workforce is a loyal and productive one, which will no doubt go on to achieve greater output, results and profits for the enterprise in which they work.The establishment of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP, which is examining in detail issues of this nature, constitutes a most innovative development and I look forward to its contribution in supporting and facilitating organisational change and innovation.The theme of partnership is one that has been used liberally by all of us who have been involved in this debate over the past decade. It is vital that we mean what we say when we talk about partnership. Real partnership can achieve so much. I might mention here an initiative which I undertook as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs. In the light of serious health and safety concerns in the construction sector, in consultation with the Health and Safety Authority, the trades unions and the construction industry, I established the Construction Safety Partnership Plan. I am convinced this plan, agreed by both sides, has lead to a considerable reduction in injuries and fatalities on building sites. I am also aware the operation of the plan continues to be under review and that more work needs to be done in this area, but that plan is a very good example of how partnership can be very beneficial to working people.On the general success of the economy since the initiation of the partnership process, the latest report of the NESC, one of the bodies directly affected by this Bill, outlines three principal factors that have been responsible for the dramatic transformation of our economic and employment fortunes over the past decade: a national policy and institutional framework which was consistent, highly focused on competitiveness and employment-creation, innovation and problem solving; an export sector that was greatly expanded and increasingly concentrated in high-value, high-growth market segments; and the European Union, because it increased market access, created a level playing field through regulation, provided a relatively stable monetary environment and supported Ireland's infrastructural and social development.Change, however, has come not just in purely economic terms. Dramatic growth in employment has had the consequent positive effect of drawing not only the unemployed, in particular, the long-term unemployed, but women and others into the workplace, many of whom had little expectation of finding meaningful, well remunerated employment with quality working conditions.Perhaps one of the most illustrative indicators of success lies in the fact that many of those who found work were those countless emigrants of the 1980s who returned to participate and build the new Ireland.Therefore the various partnership agreements since the inaugural Programme for National Recovery have changed with the times to encompass a wider social and economic agenda. The latest programme, appropriately named Sustaining Progress, sets out new goals capable of being realised and represents and reflects the reality of the current economic environment.Social Partnership provided the common dynamism and shared interest that was necessary in dragging Ireland out of the doldrums of the 1980s. Critically, partnership enabled and empowered the whole nation, from the wealthy to the poorest in society, to participate in the transformation of society in the knowledge that each individual had a positive contribution to make and that sectoral and group concerns and anxieties would be articulated at the highest levels. Partnership was and is about shared interests, and that shared interest is the continuing economic and social development of the country in a manner that enables all of our citizens to avail of the benefits of a growing economy.We should never be complacent about the process and should continually be willing and able to accept that we have not got it right and review it. I suppose, in reality we never will get it totally right because there will always be people who will miss the efforts being made, whether that be in education or elsewhere. We should certainly, through this process, make a huge effort.That is why now, more than ever, partnership under Sustaining Progress is critical. If we can be partners in building success and if we can be partners through booming economic times, then it is critical that we exercise that same partnership in a period of economic unpredictability.In this context, the three constituent organisations of the new National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, have continuously pushed out the boundaries of social dialogue. The primary objective and role of this office is to add value to the work of these constituent bodies by creating the environment and conditions where co-operative endeavours can be pursued and maximised and the potential for duplication minimised.I hold the strong view that as a result of many years of successful partnership programmes, we have developed a partnership philosophy in Ireland that has grown in sophistication, both within the partnership agreements and outside of those structures. I sometimes question some right-wing economic journalists or observers who deride the partnership process. They have a complete lack of understanding of how sophisticated is the process. What has developed here, this whole partnership philosophy, is really central to our success and to our future, our way forward. This system has grown, both within the partnership agreements and outside of those structures.Within Sustaining Progress, the latest partnership programme, new and even more sophisticated mechanisms have been included that serve to reinforce and support the partnership process and that were probably never envisaged by the originating partners in 1987. These include the Public Transport Partnership Forum, the Housing Forum, the National Anti-Poverty Strategy Consultative Committee, the Public Private Partnership Advisory Group, the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee, the National Rural Development Forum, the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, the Forum for the Construction Industry and Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Partnership. That bears out how sophisticated the process is. The spirit of partnership is beginning to be engendered in many of the initiatives we take outside of the present boundaries of the partnership process.As Minister of State with special responsibility for overseas development and human rights I have found myself in close consultation and partnership with many NGOs and regarding the preparation for the WTO meeting in Mexico next September. The House will be aware that this will have a development agenda. I have regular consultations with NGOs. In my time as Minister of State with responsibility for trade I had consultations with IBEC, ICTU and the farming organisations, sometimes in robust circumstances. The farming organisations should become more directly involved regarding the forthcoming meeting. That process of partnership happens in a very natural way throughout Departments and the work of various Ministers. It is part and parcel of what I term a partnership philosophy that has developed. In recent times I set up a task force on information technology to examine how Ireland can share its expertise in this area with the developing world. Representatives of NGOs, Departmental officials, academics and the private sector are all involved in the task force. This kind of initiative has great potential. We can share our expertise and our success story on the ICT agenda with the developing world.We can make great use of the talents available if we apply the partnership principle in detail. I will do everything possible to ensure that. Ordinary citizens could use their talents to contribute to policy formation. The informal system outside the formal structured social partnership could be used. I accept what has been said by other Deputies that we should be willing to be flexible regarding partnership. The more sophisticated, inclusive and embracing our process and partnership becomes, the stronger it becomes and the more difficult it will be for any partner to walk away.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002, and I wish to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, for sharing his time with me.In bringing forward this legislation, the Taoiseach is honouring a commitment given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, that the NESC, the NESF and the NCPP would be located within the framework of the National Economic and Social Development Office, with each of the constituent bodies now having a statutory basis.There is good sense in this initiative, which involves bringing together three bodies whose work is mutually complementary and whose future effectiveness can be enhanced through the development of a shared vision for meeting goals and targets. The fact that the bodies are not just statutorily linked but are in addition, housed in the same building with shared resources, will inevitably lead to a more co-ordinated, collaborative approach.This legislation has its origins in social partnership and the component bodies whose future role it addresses have themselves played a major role in informing and developing the social partnership process. It is generally accepted that social partnership formed the basis for economic recovery which began in 1987, that it contributed enormously to the unprecedented levels of economic growth and activity that we have enjoyed over the last number of years and that it will sustain our progress into the future.The concept of partnership and public participation has permeated every aspect of Irish life in the years since 1987 to the extent that no major local or national initiative may be progressed without consultation and agreement with all potential players, whether it be a safety initiative in the construction industry as alluded to by the Minister of State, or something such as a local village plan.The process of partnership building and the effort to achieve consensus may often be slow, tedious and painstaking but the benefits of a successful outcome are manifest. In a small open economy such as ours, the benefits of partnership are particularly significant. The successive agreements which began with the Programme for National Recovery in 1987 and which brought together Government, employers, trade unions, farmers and representatives of civil society, have delivered real benefits in terms of increased employment, record low levels of unemployment and a significantly higher standard of living for all.History will show that those groups who have opted out of the process to pursue their own sectoral or individual agendas have found themselves isolated from the decision-making process. The experience of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland would be a case in point. In this regard, I welcome the fact that at a time of critical importance to Irish agriculture, farming organisations have now returned to the social partnership stage. Facing as we do into vital negotiations on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the world trade agreement, it is more important than ever that we have a clear national consensus on the progress that needs to be achieved in the national interest.It is appropriate to pay tribute in this debate to the three component bodies which on foot of this legislation, will be dissolved and reconstituted on a statutory basis. The longest established of those bodies, the National and Economic Social Council, can be proud of the manner in which it has fulfilled its remit in advising Government on the development of the national economy and the achievement of social justice. NESC has produced over one hundred reports, some of which have provided the framework for the negotiations of national agreements, most notably, A Strategy for Development 86-90, published in 1986; A Strategy for the 90s: Economic Stability and Structural Change; A Strategy for Competitiveness: Growth and Employment, produced in 1993; A Strategy into the 21st Century, published in 1996; and Opportunity, Challenges and Capacities for Choice which was produced in 1999. I pay tribute to all those involved in those highly significant publications.In its 30 years of existence NESC has undertaken important studies on a range of issues affecting economic and social policy. Its published research series has studied issues as diverse as the Irish dairy processing industry and the Irish modern music industry.Established 20 years after its sister organisation, the National Economic and Social Forum has done valuable work in evaluating the implementation of policies dealing with equality and social inclusion. As social inclusion and the drive to combat poverty and marginalisation are at the heart of the social partnership process, it is entirely appropriate that policies aimed at achieving those objectives be monitored and critically analysed on an on-going basis. I wish success to the NESF as it takes up this challenge under the new arrangements.The National Centre for Partnership and Performance evolved in 2001 from the previous National Centre for Partnership, established in 1997 and has as its objective the provision of institutional support for diffusing work place partnership across the public and private sectors. The establishment of the centre was prompted by concerns that although social partnership was successfully evolving at national level, work place partnership and advanced forms of work organisation were not widely evident at local level. Research findings were available in 1997 to bear this out. Since the establishment of the NCP however, a survey published by Industrial Relations News in early 2000 examined nearly 70 examples of local partnership arrangements and found that progress had been achieved in terms of finding out why and under what conditions work place innovations succeed. Now established on a statutory basis, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance will continue to focus on improving institutional support for enterprise partnerships.For Ireland to remain competitive in all types of international economic environments, every sector of our economy, the public and private sectors, employers and employees, business interests and trade unions must continuously develop new approaches to change and adaptation.We must continue to develop new models of partnership so that through flexibility, increased productivity can be achieved thereby raising living standards, bettering the delivery and quality of services and improving the overall quality of life in Ireland. Under the terms of this new Bill the National Economic and Social Development Office will develop as a centre of excellence in the area of social dialogue, analysis and reporting and will contribute in a significant way to ensuring that we maintain our competitiveness in an ever-changing world. We have successfully met the challenge of reducing unemployment in Ireland in the last decade. In the years ahead the challenge is to sustain and consolidate our economic achievements so that we can continue to dispense the proceeds of our increased wealth among the ranks of the less well-off.Since his days as Minister for Labour in 1987, no one has done more or been more successful in the task of building consensus and progressing social partnership than the Taoiseach. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that it is he who brings this Bill before the House. I commend the Bill to the House.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I support the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002, which will bring together the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. These bodies have been doing excellent work since the commencement of the partnership process in 1987. Times were much different, economically speaking, when the process was commenced by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. The excellent work that was being done by the social partners at that time was brought together in the National Economic and Social Council. The levels of unemployment and emigration were high at that time and the debt-GDP ratio was at an unsustainable level. We were pricing ourselves out of the market in the late 1980s and our opportunities for expansion and market share were limited.The partnership that was brought about at that time was a structure within which stakeholders in society, such as farmers, business interests and unions, could join the Government in mapping out the path ahead. The Programme for National Recovery, which was the first partnership agreement in modern times, set out exactly what needed to be done. It was supported by the Fine Gael Party, which was led by Alan Dukes at the time, by means of the Tallaght strategy. Everybody knew that the country could not continue to sustain the levels of debt and taxation in the system that were stifling economic activity and growth. We have seen improvements in the public finances, improved economic growth, increases in living standards, higher employment and less emigration over the years. The various partnership agreements have tried to sustain the development that started in 1987. The national condition is much different now. Many positive economic aspects of the economy have arisen as a result of partnership over the years.The changing economic circumstances we face in 2003 require the same partnership of business, unions, farmers, the Government and the Oireachtas if our levels of economic growth and activity are to be sustained. There are many warning signs in the economy, for example, our competitiveness is slipping rather quickly. The objectives set out in the late 1980s and early 1990s and achieved since then could be frittered away if we do not achieve partnership and if we do not work together as a people to sustain employment. We need to keep costs down so that we can compete effectively and face the challenges of other markets in eastern Europe and the Far East.It cannot be doubted that there were improvements in the education system in the late 1960s, following the introduction of free second level education and improvements in access to third level education. Investment in education at all levels is crucial if we are to have a well-maintained and skilled workforce available for employment at all times. It is important that we do not place a financial burden on families, ensure that the best possible potential and talent is managed throughout the economy and provide a skilled workforce.Circumstances have changed, as I have mentioned, and the partnership agenda which is discussed in the most recent programme, Sustaining Progress, should change as well. I am disappointed by the manner in which the partnership process has developed in recent years. A veil of secrecy is placed over what takes place in partnership discussions and the Oireachtas has no input. A very centralised system, which does not take account of the views of ordinary people who are part of the partnership process, has developed over the past 15 years. It does not take into account the need for democratic accountability in the Oireachtas, the Members of which are elected by the people. We are charged with ensuring that the services that are deployed throughout the economy for the benefit of consumers and the people as a whole provide value for taxpayers' money. Sustaining Progress has failed to address these issues. It is largely a pay document, nothing more and nothing less. The 18-month period it covers is a very short timeframe.If we are serious about getting better value for money and having good, reliable and quality public services, it is extremely important that the democratic deficit that has built up in the Oireachtas is addressed. Partnership should be made meaningful in terms of the flexible approach that is required to deal with the deteriorating level of service we are getting for the vast amount of money that is going into our public services.I do not have to remind any Member of the House of the mantra we hear on a regular basis in relation to the amount of money going into the health service, for example. The Minister for Finance appointed a group of consultants to develop the Brennan report so that the Minister for Health and Children can be told what to do and what not to do in relation to achieving better value for money in the health service. I would have thought that the Minister, Deputy Martin, would have achieved value for money anyway. It is rather peculiar that the Minister for Finance felt obliged to draw up a report to help the Minister for Health and Children to achieve better value for money. Taxpayers expect accountability and value for money. They expect us to make the necessary changes in flexible structures to give them value for money and to deliver a better quality of service. The Government unilaterally decided to allocate an enormous amount of resources to certain health service personnel in recent years at the expense of nurses, doctors and patient care, which is what the health system should be about.There is no strategic management initiative. We are told that the plans to give us better value for money and accountability in the public services, particularly the health service, will be revealed in due course. There are 11 health boards to deal with a small population, equivalent to that of greater Manchester. This issue has been hanging around for a considerable period of time, waiting to be tackled by the Government. Rather than praising itself for putting such a large amount of money into the system, the Government should outline how better value for money will be achieved as a result. Waiting lists should be reduced, instead of allowing them to increase. It is ironic that the success of the health system, according to the Minister, can be determined by the amount of money he has put into it rather than by the throughput of activity or the patient care that is being provided. The administrative developments in the health care system need to be examined as a matter of urgency and I hope the Minister for Health and Children will not delay any longer in ensuring that it happens. I hope he receives the necessary support from the social partners to make sure it happens.Similarly, there is an enormous number of problems in the education system, such as people dropping out of school and the standards of numeracy and literacy. We have had a number of initiatives over the years that are now being reduced in terms of expenditure. Those initiatives have worked, such as the one to combat early school leavers, the home tuition scheme, the school completion programme and initiatives for people in disadvantaged areas. Such schemes should be sacrosanct if we are serious about bringing people along with us and giving them an opportunity. The most important thing we can give people, in order to alleviate poverty and disadvantage, is the opportunity to better themselves in society. The first prerequisite of that is equality of opportunity. I regret that the Government has targeted fewer resources in educational disadvantage than it has in previous years. These issues should be revisited in the 2004 Estimates to ensure that the good work that is being done in partnership by home-school liaison people, teachers, parents and pupils to secure a good education is continued from the point of view of any future partnership agreements. Such funding should be ring-fenced.There is no punctuality, reliability or quality service in the area of public transport. A great deal of money is being spent through the national development plan on rail and bus services. There have been new initiatives such as quality bus corridors in our capital city and taxis have been deregulated. While a number of actions have been taken people are still alarmed and appalled by the amount of money going into the system. There is no movement of personnel, particularly in the monolithic structure of Córas Iompair Éireann in order to free up some of the routes and the services that could be ripe for privatisation or competition. The problem with partnership at the moment is that a degree of inflexibility is developing which is ensuring that we are not getting the type of competition for services in the transport area, for example, that people ultimately want – a better quality service. One can have all the partnership in the world but the Government must act. It must take responsibility if no action is being taken at a partnership level. At the end of the day, Governments are responsible for making things happen. There is no point to the grandiose statements made by the Minister, Deputy Brennan, in recent times about the possibility of deregulation in regard to transport services, breaking up CIE or Aer Rianta or any of these matters if there is an inflexible attitude in regard to the partnerships that are involved in making that happen. Flexibility is very important nowadays in regard to the issues of deregulation and competition if we are to ensure that we have what the consumers of our public services want and what the working people who are paying taxes want, namely a good quality, reliable, efficient service.There have been many reports over the years on various aspects of our public services – many of which are gathering dust. We never had as much money or opportunity as we have had in the past five or six years in order to bring about genuine reform. Money has been thrown at every problem in order to try to solve it. If there was a gap in any market or a problem to be resolved, it was always solved by throwing money at it. That is no longer acceptable, nor should it ever have been acceptable as a way of solving a problem. We must have reform in the context of putting resources into an area, particularly our public services, to ensure that we get proper accountability and value for money.A work programme is required in the context of where we are today in terms of partnership and in bringing these three bodies together on a statutory basis in order to get better value for money and better access for consumers to many public services. Our competitiveness is slipping and inflation is not being tackled. The anti-inflation package that was promised in the recent partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is paying lip service to the issue while there are no proposals to implement a package of reform that will bring about meaningful changes in work practices, give greater flexibility and help to reduce the level of costs that have increasingly become an issue, particularly in the non-traded services which was highlighted in the recent Forfás report.The Minister should not forget that the Houses of the Oireachtas have an important role to play. We are the guardians of the purse strings. We have a very centralised system of Government with 15 members of Government deciding everything and expecting some 150 others to follow through the lobbies for and against those proposals. I submit that the type of Government we currently have in this jurisdiction is probably akin to the most centralised system of government that existed in eastern Europe. We have just got rid of it beyond the Berlin Wall. Our system is in urgent need of reform. One cannot expect that the people will continue to engage and be deeply interested in the political process unless they are able to see that we have properly accountable Government, a properly accountable system and meaningful debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on a huge range of issues that are costing enormous amounts of taxpayers' money to sustain our public services. Work could be initiated in terms of a work programme in which the Houses of the Oireachtas could become involved. The amalgamation of these three bodies through the National Economic and Social Development Office is an important step forward.Most Oireachtas Members would agree that they would like to become more actively involved through a proper committee system, or in the Houses of the Oireachtas generally, with the National Economic and Social Development Office. In this way we could relay the work that is being done to the people in a meaningful way in order to sustain economic progress and employment and keep us competitive. This will give our services a radical shake-up in terms of reforming them to give better value for money and greater efficiency in order that people will get good quality service for the taxes they contribute, a contribution which can at times be painful. If people continue to want the low tax economy which has been important for the economic growth of the country, we cannot fritter away money on public services without that reform and without greater accountability.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I understand I am sharing time with Deputy Conor Lenihan.The economics editor of The Irish Times writes today as follows:For some months now, many Irish businesses have been looking at the euro's rise and keeping their fingers crossed that it would soon peter out. But the euro just keeps on going – or perhaps more accurately money keeps flowing out of the US dollar – and the implications for exports and growth this year now look likely to be quite serious. The euro's strength makes life harder for exporters as they must either accept lower profit margins or persuade their customers to live with higher prices.As Deputy Hogan said, we are talking about a world economy which is in a state of flux at a time when we need to remain competitive. The ESRI in its quarterly economic commentary states:The terms of the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, should reinforce the disinflationary trend in the economy. We estimate that the terms of the agreement, including public sector benchmarking provisions, provide for wage growth of approximately 4% and 3% in 2003 and 2004 respectively. These terms should move the economy closer to sustainable, productivity-justified pay rates. Given the tighter public finance position, a more focused sense of national investment priorities is needed to ensure that necessary investment is not restricted given its importance for the economy's long-run growth. The low interest rate environment creates opportunity for economically justifiable investment to be undertaken while respecting the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact.This is the context in which this Bill is being introduced to the Dáil. The National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002 provides us with an opportunity to give an overview of our position through social partnership and various initiatives undertaken in the past ten years, certainly since 1987 when social partnership was first mooted by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey – a process pioneered, of course, by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.The strategy has been effective but it is clear that if we do not remain competitive we will lose all the advantages we accumulated in recent years. I am not calling for widespread deregulation but certain areas need to be examined in this regard. For example, deregulation of the taxi industry was not done in the most efficient way. Paradoxically, we have now reached the stage where the industry will have to be regulated if we are to provide a competitive and efficient taxi service.The cost of insurance is driving small businesses out of existence, many of which I am aware of in my own constituency. Premia are so high that two or three members of a small workforce may have to be let go to avoid closure. In some cases workers are let go while in other cases businesses have to close down. We need to tackle the insurance industry's monopoly more seriously and it is not tenable to long finger any such proposals. While I welcome the working group's proposal, I would also welcome greater initiatives to tackle the real costs of insurance.A few weeks ago, I was visiting some people in the United Kingdom and I was astounded to discover that the cost of public liability and employer's liability insurance is a fraction of what it is here. Clearly, that is making us uncompetitive. The cost of services has rocketed in the last few years and, while I may not be popular for saying this, there is a rip-off mentality which needs to be curbed. Unfortunately, we are ripping each other off and unless we realise that we are in this together, we will all sink together. It took much hard work and painstaking development for Ireland to become the most successful economy in the world at one point and we have the capacity to regain that position.There used to be a State telecoms monopoly but now we virtually have a private monopoly in that sector, which is untenable. Sometimes we pick on soft targets and I am not persuaded that either the groceries order or the retail planning guidelines ought to be changed. I am not certain that such alterations would achieve anything at a macro-economic level, although perhaps I could be persuaded otherwise.The nub of the Bill concerns the issue of social partnership. As other speakers have pointed out, this particular model for industrial peace and development, employment creation and support for the less well-off, is quite unique. We started off with the Programme for National Recovery, which was modest enough, but it was developed at a time when we were the economic basket case of Europe. That programme demonstrated what co-operation, co-ordination and a little bit of economic pain being suffered by everybody could do for the country as a whole. The new programme, entitled Sustaining Progress, is a refined and sophisticated version of what was originally a rather rudimentary approach to solving our economic problems. The various programmes have delivered economic stability and a large measure of industrial harmony.It is interesting to note that any current industrial disharmony seems to be happening in the public sector rather than in the private sector. Perhaps we need to explore why there is such emerging disharmony in the public sector. I heard that question being debated on the radio today. Wage increases have been delivered that were beyond what anyone could have expected in years past but we will now have to cut our cloth according to our measure. The partnership programmes have protected the most vulnerable, including young people. This Government and its predecessor have delivered significant increases in child benefits and child care supports generally. The amount of money that is being put into child care, admittedly from a very low base, is quite significant, so we are making progress in that area. The partnership programmes have also supported the elderly who will acknowledge that the improvements have gone beyond pensions to include day care and other services. In addition, despite the many criticisms of our health service, if one talks to anybody who has received treatment, they will say that once one gains access to it, the care is second to none.Our partnership model is unique, although hitherto my colleagues on the Convention on the Future of Europe and I thought that this sophisticated model of social cohesion and development was widespread in Europe. People talk about the economic models of Boston versus Berlin, but I thought that Berlin had a very sophisticated social partnership model. It was only when I sat on the working group on economic governance that I found to my horror that the traditional partners representing the trade union and management interests on the convention were quite determined – and, in fact, they seem to have succeeded in their determination – to ensure that any extension to the model of social partnership that we recommended as Irish delegates, should be resisted. They certainly had no great interest in ensuring that farmers and voluntary or community sectors were on board; it was going to be trade unions and management, full stop. That is something the rest of Europe can learn from us, however.The draft constitutional treaty on the future of Europe, which has emerged into the public domain in recent days, will underpin much of what we are doing here. Various elements of EU legislation have been available to us in supporting workers and combating social exclusion. I was pleased to be able to support the report of the working party on a social Europe, as were the other Irish delegates, which recommended: the promotion of full employment; social justice leading to social peace; sustainable development; economic, social and territorial cohesion; a social market economy; quality of work; life-long learning; social inclusion; a high degree of social protection; equality between men and women; non-discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, religious or sexual orientation, disability and age; children's rights; a high level of public health; efficient, high-quality social services; and services of general interest.Although I did not have an opportunity of analysing it in great detail, I was pleased to note that Part Two of the draft constitutional treaty has come through today. The preamble to section 2, Article III-98 states:The Union and the Member States, having in mind fundamental social rights such as those set out in the European Social Charter signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and the 1989 Community Charter on the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, shall have as their objectives the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation while the improvement is being maintained, proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment, and the combating of exclusion.To this end the Union and the Member States shall act taking account of the diverse forms of national practices, in particular in the field of contractual relations, and the need to maintain the competitiveness of the Union economy.Once some people hear of a new treaty emanating from the EU they will jump up and say they are not supporting it. Anyone who analyses what is being said in that preamble, however, will recognise that no attempt is being made to introduce a uniform arrangement across all EU member states. In fact, the contrary is the case because models that are appropriate to a particular member state can be continued. That is as it should be. We are discussing the principle of subsidiarity, which has worked well. As part of the partnership model, we need to plan and work together. I listened earlier to the leader of the Fine Gael party, Deputy Kenny, saying that the social partnership model adopts the top down approach. I would have thought the case was the reverse where a diverse range of participants work together, painstakingly and carefully, to ensure that in a given set of economic and social circumstances, the best possible outcomes can be achieved for everyone, ranging from the quite well-off to the not so well-off.The social partnership model here is rather unique in that elements of civil society, who are emerging as an important sector, have a role in developing social partnership and economic and social strategies. For example, the work area-based partnerships have done since they were established is remarkable. I concur with Deputy Hogan that initiatives in the area of education ought to be ring-fenced from any serious cutbacks in funding. The RAPID programmes – there are not many of them in the country – and CLÁR programmes, which target social exclusion in marginalised areas, are unique. They do not have extra money to spend but they are in a position to advance strategies more quickly than statutory bodies normally can. These bodies ought not to be unduly interfered with. Some of us will be involved in city development boards which have evolved partly as a result of the reform of local government and the partnership process. Reform of local government is an initiative of the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey. There is a new range of participants involved in community development who had not been involved hitherto, which is welcome.The National Economic and Social Forum is one of the elements proposed as a participant in the National Economic and Social Development Office. It has done significant work since its foundation. It has examined a number of important issues, ranging from the labour market for older workers, access to hospital care and the whole issue of early school leavers. It had a seminal report published on the issue of early school leavers. I agree that the amount of money being spent on early school leaving initiatives for the educationally disadvantaged has increased dramatically in recent years, particularly with the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, heading up the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. Breaking the Cycle and school completion programmes are important initiatives which have arisen as a result of the support partnership has given to them.The affordable housing initiative has been examined carefully by the National Economic and Social Forum. This area could be usefully revisited because the cost of housing is getting out of the reach of many average income earners. Reports have been published on the level of welfare payments available to people who are unemployed, those working in the home and those who want to return to education. If it were not for the partnership process, I am not certain the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands who have availed of vocational training schemes and back-to-education schemes would have benefited and changed their lives through a return to education.Community employment schemes are being debated at the moment. I am concerned that there is not a widespread understanding of the value of participation in community employment schemes for participants. It has a significant pay-back in terms of support for communities. It is penny wise and pound foolish to cut down on the numbers who can participate in community employment schemes. There are a number of people who are so old at this stage that they cannot return to the workforce. Having enjoyed working for approximately 20 hours per week, and socialising with fellow workers, it is unreasonable to expect them to return, in many cases, to the loneliness and isolation of their homes. Equally communities will suffer, whether in the delivery of community and social services or support for sports clubs and so on. Unfortunately, it is a retrograde step – I will not be popular for saying this – and it is time we considered what we are doing in terms of implementing social policy.The functions of the forum as outlined in the Bill are to monitor and analyse the implementation of specific measures and programmes identified in the context of social partnerships, especially those concerned with the achievement of equality and social inclusion and a new function, which will be reflected in a Government amendment in due course, and to facilitate public consultation on policy matters referred to it by the Government from time to time.Perhaps it is time to look at the key participants in the whole social partnership model. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for the work he has done on their behalf. I welcome the inclusion of the elderly as participants in social partnership discussions because I believe they bring a unique perspective to bear on discussions. In Dublin we are well aware of the work the Council on Ageing and Older People and the Senior Citizens Parliament are doing. These groups are doing valuable work.

I commend the Bill to the House.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	641	While my party supports the Bill, it does not curtail us from raising questions on how the whole partnership issue works. I must say at the outset that I am pleased Deputy Carey put a few issues on the record from a Fianna Fáil backbencher's point of view. He referred to the rip-off culture which currently exists. Having travelled with him in recent weeks, I concur with him that we are pricing ourselves out of the market. Some of the prices charged in this country are questionable. It is difficult to see how those involved can expect to have a future in the economy, be it in the tourism sector or elsewhere. The euro enables us to easily compare prices in this country with those in the eurozone. It is an issue that must be addressed, as much by the private sector as the Government. In saying this, I do not detract from the importance of the Government's involvement in the area of insurance or elsewhere.I also welcome Deputy Carey's comments on the Groceries Order. I hope it and the retail planning guidelines will be maintained. It will be interesting to see what the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment proposes in this area. My background is in farming and the co-operative movement. I declare my interest as a dairy farmer. My family farm produces quality milk for the liquid milk market through the Town of Monaghan Co-Operative. Through my involvement in the IFA and the European Union committee for beef and veal, of which I was chairman for five years in the early 1980s, I learned at first hand the benefits to be gained from discussion and partnerships at every level, including at home, within the European Union and at the WTO talks.Fine Gael led the debate on the country's entry to the European Economic Community and the party's former leaders returned to the public domain to campaign in favour of the Nice treaty referendum. One former leader, Mr. Alan Dukes, led the partnership approach with the Tallaght strategy, which was the start of a new beginning that has greatly benefited the country.Fine Gael also led the first partnership type talks on Northern Ireland. The former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, with Brian Faulkner, established a partnership agreement of a kind; the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald and the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, formulated the Anglo-Irish Agreement; and, as former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, played a major role during a difficult period of the peace process. His recommendation of the appointment of Senator George Mitchell was typical of his approach. Senator Mitchell played a major role in the Northern Ireland peace talks.All other parties followed what Fine Gael started in the 1960s and 1970s. Fianna Fáil questioned the Anglo-Irish Agreement but later worked it, while Sinn Féin at last realised that talks and partnership were a better means of solving our national problems. This illustrates how far we have come and indicates how, with commitment, partnership talks can help, especially in the context of my small farming background.This important Bill brings together three different bodies under one workable structure. It will ensure that regardless of party or politics, the right personnel are in place to lead the country in its long-term interests. Partnership was established in an attempt to curtail social unrest, at which it has succeeded, and contain wage increases. I am not sure of its achievements on this aspect because with all awards made on a percentage basis, those on higher incomes have gained dramatically. By contrast, those of us in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and the Border region have, unlike others, not been fortunate enough to attract high paying industries, such as IT. More usually, workers in this area earn wages of between €200 and €300 per week in factories in the food and timber industries. These industries are under pressure, with the prevalence of two and three day weeks.Partnership must take account of the weaker members of society and in this regard, I am not sure if it has been as successful as it should. While more jobs have been created in the Pale and the Dublin area, a better spread of job creation is required. The 30 years of the Troubles in the Border region have not helped as it was not considered to be a suitable area for investment. Nevertheless, a small number of factories had the courage to invest and have done very well. I hope that in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, the Border region will be seen as an area where partnership can work and bring benefits.Since the launch of the various partnership agreements, a number of initiatives have been taken to address the problems in the health area. In this context, the national health strategy was launched before the last general election. I would do my constituents a disservice if I did not raise the issue of Monaghan General Hospital which is approaching its first anniversary – on 2 July –of being off-call. The Minister promised to do his best to have the problems at the hospital addressed within a short period of time. While some thought he would deliver in a couple of days, I did not believe it was possible. However, I never dreamed that 12 months later, the hospital would still be off-call.Cavan is under pressure, yet a new report will question the necessity for rural hospitals. Does partnership apply only to the people of Dublin or is it for the whole country? I spoke on an earlier occasion of my visit as part of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body to a hospital in the Isle of Man. Since then I visited another hospital on an island off the coast of Canada. It is impossible to understand how people living in isolated areas elsewhere can be given a proper service of a kind that is not provided here.Comhairle na n-Ospidéal and the various representative bodies decide policy on the location of hospitals. If there is to be a true partnership, as envisaged by this legislation, we must return policy making to politicians and remove it from bodies and organisations. If a small place like the Isle of Man can provide a service of which anybody could be proud to its small community, paid for by taxpayers, why can the people of Cavan-Monaghan, County Clare or elsewhere not also have a proper service? If partnership is to last and mean anything in the long-term, we must treat all the people equally.

I will give the Minister of State and the Department all the support I can provided he shows that is what he is doing. I do not question the Minster of State's credibility, but we listened to many promises in January 2002 which, 18 months later, have not been fulfilled. While I did not lose my seat at the last general election, my colleague did as a result of the Monaghan Hospital saga. In view of this, the Minister of State cannot blame me for feeling sore. We are in politics to make things happen and I want to ensure that those I represent get a fair share.Deputy Carey spoke of involving the elderly in partnership. While I would welcome such a development, they have not received any benefits. Their home help has been removed. The Minister of State can shake his head, but I am dealing with the reality, with the telephone calls and letters to my office.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	647	Yes. The number of home-help carers has been halved in the North-Eastern Health Board region. Those in need of a bed in a nursing home are finding it difficult to find one. Although it is a little easier now in the summer months, the problem will return to haunt us shortly. A two-tier health service is something that none of us wants, but that is what we have at present. Someone who can pay can get service, while those who cannot must wait, and the waiting lists issued recently prove that. If one pays, one gets health care quickly.What annoys me most is the fact that, under the special initiative for waiting lists, people can be treated, be it at home here in some private area or in England or elsewhere, with all sorts of grandeur. However, back at Monaghan General Hospital, a theatre, nurses and top-quality surgeons are sitting there without being given an opportunity. It does not make sense that someone with varicose veins or some other reasonably simple complaint must go to a private hospital in Westmeath where services are available and paid for by the State, albeit through the health board or whatever. Others have been sent to Birmingham or elsewhere. That issue must be sorted out in partnership.The issue of insurance has already been mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Hogan, Deputy Carey and others. It must really be tackled. Small industry especially is being hit seriously. Through my travels, I have learned that 11 September, those big words that encompass almost everything in this country, which caused our problems and made our insurance more expensive, did not do so. It did not cause problems in the UK, Canada or other places. We must ask major questions about what the Minister, Deputy Harney, has been doing on insurance for the last six years, for this is not a Government of one year, as some people try to make us believe, but a partnership of the last six. If that partnership is to work out in the long-term, insurance must be tackled realistically and properly. It is disturbing that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not seem able to give us a date at this stage for an important Bill to introduce an independent body to deal with that. That was promised and we understood there was a commitment.It is vital that such things be dealt with realistically. Small companies are going to the wall, while others are taking the gamble of not insuring, which is even more difficult and serious. Small builders are going out of business because they cannot get cover. I am saying clearly to the Minister that, if insurance is not tackled quickly, we will have a serious problem.I hear many people mentioning that the penalty points system will do miracles as far as car insurance is concerned. I hope that it does, for Fine Gael supports the effort to ensure that lives are saved on the roads and elsewhere. However, it seems, unfortunately, that the points system will be used against drivers rather than for them. I have no problem if someone has 12 points and loses his or her licence, or that, when he or she goes to get insurance the next time, it will cost more. Surely, however, those who have no points should be getting some benefit from the savings which accrue to insurance companies because of there being fewer accidents. There is no point in an insurance company saying that prices are high because of the high level of accidents if, when they are curtailed, there is no commitment to bring premia down.I touched on the area of jobs at the start. It must be examined seriously if partnership is to benefit the whole country. When one looks at the experience of the outer counties in recent years, one sees jobs being created in Galway, Athlone, Dublin and sometimes further south, but how many are created in the Border region as a whole? If partnership and the peace initiative – which, in spite of everyone's comments about its difficulties, I believe is here to stay – are to mean anything, the Government, through the IDA, must take concrete steps to ensure that jobs are created. I speak not just of Cavan and Monaghan but about the entire Border region, for we have suffered dramatically. Due to the fact that we have suffered in jobs, education structures have been taken away from us rather than being created for our benefit. In Cavan, there is a very good college, but it was not allowed any building this year. In Monaghan, St. Patrick's Agricultural College was sold off, though it was possibly the best site in the county for a third level college. Those issues must be dealt with under partnership. There must be equality.One of the ways in which the Government may have direct control in creating jobs for the Border region is decentralisation. One day, sitting where the Minister is or perhaps just to one side, his colleague, the Minister for Finance, explained that there were some difficulties and that it was not easy to create decentralisation where the infrastructure was poor, there was a lack of sports facilities such as swimming pools and where there was poor access to broadband. Those are all issues about which something must be done if partnership is to mean anything to people in the more rural areas. I was equally interested to hear Deputy Carey talking about community employment schemes, and it is vital that they be considered again. I hope that he will speak as loudly, if not even more loudly, when he gets an opportunity to speak to his parliamentary party or the Minister.I will return to the issue of farming, if Members will excuse me. At the moment farmers are not being paid the full rate of farm development grant or anything else in County Monaghan or County Cavan. However, there is very little in the partnership for farmers in general, and I am worried about Deputy Harney's idea of doing away with the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 and retail planning law. The problem of inflation has its roots not there but in insurance and all the other issues, many of which can be controlled by the Government, for example, increased VAT.I have letters from a local supermarket in Monaghan town, Fleming's, which is having a major extension built. It is extremely worried, for it has located its business in the centre of town and done a good job at serving the public. It uses Irish products, whereas many of those outside supermarkets at the edge of towns are interested only in pure profit. They have no interest in the economy or anything else. I wish to question the Minister and beg him to ensure that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 is not repealed for the sake of being seen to do something or that the retail planning guidelines are amended to allow the big multiples in. Fleming's in Monaghan and other similar stores throughout the country have employed local people and used local products, without any abuse. It is impossible to understand why some of those outside retailers wish to use milk as a lead product sold at minimum cost when at the same time they are selling water that has just come up out of the ground at no cost whatsoever for nearly nothing.The fact that my dairy herd must be keep in at night due to the weather conditions is costing a fortune. Many dairy farmers are being forced out of business because of economic pressures and it seems the only benefit that this Government can give through the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is to consider removing the Groceries Order. If partnership is to work for the disadvantaged, whether at rural level or in the centre of Dublin, farmers, the elderly and everyone else must be treated equally and taken into account.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	650	I welcome the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill. This office will comprise three bodies to be known as the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. This Bill, when enacted, will for the first time set each of the constituent bodies on a statutory basis. The National Economic and Social Council was established in 1973 with a brief to advise the Government on the development of the national economy and the achievement of social justice. In addition to advising the Government, the council provides a forum in which views can be exchanged between people who have a common interest in the development of the economy and the pursuit of social justice. Since 1986 the National Economic and Social Council has undertaken a three yearly review of economic and social policy. Previous reports published by the National Economic and Social Council have informed the series of national agreements that have been negotiated since 1987 between the social partners. Under the terms of the new Bill, the council will continue to analyse and report on strategic issues connected to the effective development of the economy and the achievement of social justice.The Government established the National Centre for Partnership and Performance to support and drive change in the workplace and enable organisations in the private and public sectors, through partnership, to respond to change, build capability and to improve performance. For Ireland to remain competitive in all types of international economic environments, every sector of our community and economy, public and private, employers and employees, industrial groups and trade unions, must develop new approaches to change and adaptation. Together we must find new models of partnership for increasing productivity and flexibility, raising living standards, bettering the delivery of services and improving the quality of life. In 1993 the Government set up the National Economic and Social Forum to achieve consensus on as wide a basis as possible on major economic and social policy issues. Since 1998 the forum's work has focused on evaluating the implementation of policies dealing with equality and social inclusion.The National Economic and Social Development Office will promote the development of a shared vision for meeting goals and targets. It will encourage the three constituent organisations to optimise their influence and effectiveness by means of a collaborative policy approach. The series of national partnership agreements, beginning with the Programme for National Recovery in 1987 have made a major contribution to our success. These arrangements have brought the Government, the employers, the unions, the farmers and representatives of civil society together in support of a multi-annual programme covering pay, fiscal policy, social welfare provisions and other important areas of economic and social policy.Partnership is especially important in small open economies, those most exposed to the challenges and opportunities of international trade and investment flows, the economic impact of rapidly evolving technologies and the fundamental need to remain competitive. These challenges and opportunities require both long-term economic strategies and the flexibility to make adjustments to take advantage of new opportunities for small economies. A broad national agreement around the central objectives of economic and social partnership helps Ireland to compete in the modern globalised economy. No party is more closely identified with social partnership than Fianna Fáil. The Taoiseach, in particular, made a remarkable contribution to establishing social partnership when he was Minister for Labour in 1987. Without partnership we could not have prepared to adapt to the changing nature of our economy and to international circumstances.Although there has been much essential liberalisation and deregulation in our economy, the continuing important role of Government in driving forward infrastructural investment must be emphasised. The area in which most people have witnessed the dramatic input and impact of partnership is employment. This took time to filter through but when it happened the results were spectacular. Team effort is essential. It is important that we all work together not for, but with, one another. Partnership has produced real and tangible rewards for ordinary people. Social partnership and past performance are no guarantee of future success. As a small global economy we cannot isolate ourselves from adverse economic surroundings. The recent National and Economic Social Council report stated that we need to respond to that vulnerability through rapid and widespread adoption of policy, laws, regulatory regimes and structures in the traded, non-traded and public sectors while retaining a predictable long-term economic strategy and policy framework.There is no alternative to partnership. The effect of a free-for-all would be immediate and severe. As the National Economic and Social Council has put it, and as those who can remember the pre-partnership era know only too well, policy errors will be punished severely. It is an economic and social imperative to continue with the partnership process over the challenging period ahead. No one can be certain about the future as political and economic crises are all too possible. We need a measure of certainty in a very uncertain world. The County Longford Development Board is a model of partnership working for the benefit of all to promote economic development, urban and rural renewal, cultural and recreational policies. In conclusion, this Bill is to be welcomed for putting on a statutory footing those organisations that have served us so well since 1997.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I support this Bill. It will enjoy the support of all sides of the House. It is innocuous legislation in the sense that it is not divisive and that is unusual and welcome. I want to begin by referring to some of the contributions made earlier because this is a debate and we are supposed to refer to things said by other Members. Deputy Burton began her contribution this afternoon by complaining about the delays that have frustrated this Bill. It occurred to me, as it has on several occasions in the past couple of months, that a lot of time is wasted in this House by members of the Opposition abusing procedure. Government backbenchers are effectively emasculated in many ways, most particularly when they have to listen to the morning constituency half hour when Opposition members tell us that they want to adjourn the House on issues of national importance. Those issues are certainly important, but they are of local importance and Members have no business raising them at that time. The idea that the national Parliament would be adjourned because something happens in a constituency, for which a Member wants to get headline coverage is, at the very least, inappropriate.

The Labour Party which criticised the delay in the bringing forward of this Bill did so disingenuously. The Order of Business is another example of where time is wasted by all members of the Opposition by raising issues that are entirely spurious and inappropriate at that time. During the Order of Business, Members are supposed to check on promised legislation, but ironically the Opposition delays its introduction. It was after 12.30 p.m. today when we finally reached the business for which we were elected to deal, rather than the usual shouting that takes place about all sorts of nonsense.

The Order of Business could be dealt with in half an hour, but it took two hours to deal with it today. This is something about which all Members must question themselves. I am sure Fianna Fáil did this before I became a Member of this House and I am sure it will happen in the future, but some focus on what particular business is intended for might be profitable.I want to respond to another criticism made earlier in the debate, namely the allegation that Fianna Fáil is a right wing party. I did not join a right wing party, I do not believe I am a member of a right wing party and I certainly would not continue in a right wing party.

Social partnership is an unusual model of Government. As a backbencher speaking frankly, I do not really have an input in that regard. Sustaining Progress is not a document into which I had a great deal of input, if any, yet I have been elected to represent people and, effectively, to legislate. Social partnership is parallel to Government in many ways, yet lacks the same accountability this Chamber has and also the constant reviewing of the membership of the Dáil. In that sense, it is something into which we stumbled, but which has proved to be extremely effective. I do not believe anyone can argue about that. As Deputy Kelly said, the Taoiseach has been distinguished among all politicians in the history of this State in his ability to arrive at consensus with very differing people and very differing views. I believe that in a moment of honesty others might even concede that.

Sustaining Progress continues the great role that partnership has had in growing the economy.The latest figures we have received in relation to the economy are a mixed bag. There is no question about that. One can approach this from two angles. Many supposedly responsible politicians take it upon themselves to talk down the economy when there are many indicators in the figures which could be talked up. It is irresponsible of people, simply for narrow political ends, to take it upon themselves to dismiss very positive figures that have been released. For example, the OECD report of last month gave us to believe that we would have economic growth of up to 4% or 5% up to 2008. It indicated that we had unemployment under control and that inflation would be brought back from its current high position. In other words, it gave us a very good end of term report in April. This is a Paris-based independent analysis of our economy yet members of the Opposition, who have a job to do to the best of their ability, are talking it down. That causes problems for the economy because one of the most important parts of economic development is confidence in the economy and in its future.CSO figures were released today which show there were much better figures in terms of unemployment previously. We are ahead of the European Union generally. Our income levels and economic growth figures are ahead of the European Union generally and the OECD reported today that we must focus on what the Government stated it would do over and over again prior to and following the election, namely that we are here to ensure sustainability, prudence in the economic outlook and fiscal control on all sides.Having read the Bill, nothing particularly jumps out in terms of worthiness of debate. I apologise if I moved away from the Bill at times during my contribution. Section 17 refers to the requirement that there should be an equality of men and women on each of the fora that are statutorily set up under this Bill and that is welcome. I commend the Bill to the House.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	679	Is that agreed? Agreed.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	680	I have listened to a good deal of this debate. We have been told on numerous occasions that social partnership has given real and tangible rewards to ordinary individuals in pursuit of social justice. This Bill is a formalisation of the social partnership model that has been in existence here for quite some time. We need to examine the effects of that partnership, whether it has resulted in real and tangible rewards and social justice for ordinary men and women.I believe that this model of partnership is a cover for cutbacks, increases in existing charges such as refuse charges and waste water charges and the reintroduction of other charges such as domestic water charges and that over the past six years it has resulted in a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor to a great extent. The accepted figure in that regard is that a gap of approximately €350 per week has emerged since 1997 between a person earning an annual income of €40,000 and a person in receipt of unemployment assistance. The current position leaves a lot to be desired. The Celtic tiger has been used to benefit those who are already wealthy, but it certainly has not benefited to the same extent those people in receipt of social welfare incomes, low wages or the minimum wage.One of the attributes of social partnership we heard about at an early stage was that it was a real partnership and that workers would have the legal right to be represented and be members of a trade union. We have not even got that far. Neither have we managed to ensure that those on the minimum wage are outside the tax net. Instead, workers have no legal right to be members of a union and those on the minimum wage are still not outside the tax net.Partnership has been a cover for significant cutbacks and I will refer to some of them. We all know the situation in the health services. It is discussed in the House regularly. Irrespective of what Deputy Andrews said, it is right that these matters should be dealt with in the House. It is the place to deal with them. The past six years have brought about a situation which reminds me of the late 1980s when I worked in the health service as a hospital manager and the services suffered significant destruction in the form of closures of beds, hospitals and capacity of the services provided. That has lasted to this day and has bedevilled the health services. We have a two-tier health service with long waiting lists for those with medical cards or who cannot afford to pay for private treatment. If one can afford to pay, one will be seen at the drop of a hat.Is it a real and tangible reward of so-called social partnership that elderly or sick people should be on trolleys or beds in corridors, that people should be on waiting lists for anything up to two and three years, or that people with a disability have no place to care for them once they are 18? They could not be described as tangible benefits of social partnership.I find it impossible, as I am sure do other Members, to get health boards to provide home helps for ill, elderly people who want to be cared for at home, something that would save the State significant amounts of money. Not one additional hour of home help can be obtained now. Instead, there is a reduction in hours and a cutback in the service. In the circumstances, if elderly people are admitted to nursing homes, a significant cost is involved. The subvention payable is ridiculously low and families must effectively pay a second mortgage to keep their elderly relatives, be they parents, uncles or aunts, in nursing homes.Is it a real and tangible benefit that children must be educated in schools that are effectively falling apart or leaking and that many children leaving primary school have a difficulty reading and writing? I could refer to many other issues, but I will leave it at that.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	681	I have had the privilege of being a representative of the community and voluntary sector on the National Economic and Social Council for a four-year period, from 1998 to my election to the House. I have seen at first hand the value of the work it does and the restrained circumstances in which it does it. I have heard many remarks in this debate that show that Members could be more informed about the nature of the council's work and how it does it.In many respects, the NESC has been an under-resourced organisation. It has never had more than three to four researchers and two to three administrators working for it. In the most recent Book of Estimates, the money provided under the Department of the Taoiseach for the National Economic and Social Council has been reduced, and this is also the case for the National Economic and Social Forum. This is the context in which we discuss the Bill, namely, the real value we attach to economic intelligence which is vital towards sustaining progress, growth and competitiveness in society.When I was a member of the council, the main work in which we were involved was drafting the strategy document, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice. I feel proud to have contributed to that and to see in its text some of the contributions I made as a member of the council.Much of what has been said about how such documents have been treated by the political process deserves to be challenged. It is not necessarily accepted that they become Government policy. Many of the proposals in successive NESC reports have been wilfully ignored. They constantly said that the degree and areas of tax cutting by successive Governments were wrong-headed and economically flawed. We are beginning to pay the price for that in how resources are collected because we have misrepresented how much tax is collected in the system and how resources are allocated to social services.The NESC has constantly called for the introduction of an energy tax as an environmental measure, something that has been persistently ignored by the Minister for Finance. In fact, he has been one of the greatest enemies of the NESC. He has gone out of his way to ignore many of the recommendations made by the council. Another long-standing measure proposed by the NESC that I have never seen any political party having the courage to adopt, is an equality measure that would see child benefit being taxed so that the wealthy would only receive a proportion of the benefit. This is the type of thinking that takes place in the NESC, the type of ideas thrown into the political process and how we, as part of the political process, respond to it.I am dubious about the motivation behind the Bill because, from my peripheral role in the partnership process, I did not see the demand for it coming forward. I can see nothing other than a reorganisation of resources as part of a cost-cutting exercise. I am only partially familiar through its reports with the National Economic and Social Forum but I believe it also does valuable work that is complementary to the work of the NESC and in a different context. The work of the council is long-term whereas that of the forum is short-term, reactive and takes place in a more open setting. The value of the NESC is that it takes place behind closed doors and people can speak freely.I am at a loss as to what the National Centre for Partnership and Performance represents. It is a recently formed body and its functions are to contribute to national competitiveness, better public services, higher living standards, a better quality of life and development of the workplace of the future. However, we already have a National Competitiveness Council. Part of the brief of Forfás and the Industrial Development Authority is the need to pay attention to competitiveness issues. I do not know why the National Centre for Partnership and Performance exists. However, I know that the NESC and the NESF have been under-resourced and I do not see an increase in the Bill in the availability of the type of resources that would allow them carry out their work more effectively.On the issue of partnership, my experience is that it has never been real and functioning. It has always been a case that some partners are considered more equal than others. The layout of tables at meetings has the chair flanked on either side by employers and unions with farmers and the community and voluntary sector in the far corners. I saw the previous partnership agreement being negotiated in Government Buildings. I saw the side bars, the meetings behind closed doors, who had to be mollified most, and whose assent was more prized than others. When that exists, we do not have real partnership. This is a Bill that only entrenches bad practices that exist.I would also like to raise the role of elected public representatives in the decision making that comes about through partnership. I cannot understand why this House has not yet debated the Sustaining Progress agreement. I cannot understand why part of the ratification process does not involve a vote of this House as to whether we feel it is a document worth progressing as a national policy for the next three years. Until we arrive at a stage when the partnership process fully involves the political process, Bills such as this, and the establishment of such an offices, is simply an act of window dressing that the Government should be given little or no credit for.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	682	I am delighted to hear the previous contribution and I could not agree with it more. At first glance, the establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office may seem to be an admirable objective. Consulting the social partners on all strategic matters relating to economic and social development also appears laudable. Will this body have any real input into the Government's policies on taxation, health, education and social welfare? Is the Government likely pay any attention to recommendations made by this new body? I suspect it will not have the slightest impact on Government policy. It is another mudguard for the Government to deflect criticism from where it rightly belongs.I would like to take this opportunity to make a number of points regarding the ideology that drives the social and economic policies of the PD-Fianna Fáil Government and the motivations behind its advocacy of social partnership. The Government has used social partnership as a tool to silence dissent on social and economic matters. It has also used it to silence dissent in the face of wide-ranging cutbacks in health, housing, education and a deterioration in the quality of life of the working people of this State. We must see social partnership for what it has become. The Government brings the voices of the disadvantaged to the table, pays lip service to them and then delivers almost nothing. Government policy is then justified on the basis that the Government has consulted with the social partners. Social partnership has allowed the Government to evade accountability for its failure to deliver on the range of issues to which I have alluded.Social partnership has widened divisions in Irish society and has done nothing to tackle disadvantage. Social partnership would be great if it were a partnership of equals. We have just heard an example of the classical style of the meetings that are anything but reflective of partnership. The current agreement represents a poor deal for Irish workers and the low paid. It offers nothing on headline issues facing workers such as health, child care and education. Social partnership has represented an attempt by the Government to co-opt those who have been most marginalised. Their role in the process is a largely token one. This is particularly evident from the inclusion of the community and voluntary pillar. Despite a failure to deliver on demands made by the community and voluntary sector, it is being used by the Government to give the appearance of consultation and consensus. We heard from a Deputy that has been involved at the coalface and he confirmed that it was totally marginalised.Social partnership has become nothing less than a cosy club of big business, politicians, landowners and trade union bosses. The Government and employers organisations are increasingly forcing workers to bargain for rights that are rightfully theirs as part of the wider social partnership deal. These should not be seen as concessions. There is the issue of employer recognition of unions. Imagine trade unions having to negotiate for recognition in this day and age. There is also the issue of compliance with labour legislation. What is the point in having labour legislation if employers are not obliged to comply with it? The fulfilling of statutory redundancy rights is a basic workplace right. These issues should not even be on the negotiating table yet they are part of the bluff that is going on. It is most unfortunate the trade union bosses have allowed this to happen.The Government is opposed to the very concept of trade unions and has used the partnership process to create an obedient trade union leadership by making the leaders part of the establishment, therefore creating a gulf between them and the grassroots membership. The prosperity that has been created is the prosperity of big business and multinational companies. They have exploited workers and maximised profits during the economic boom. Ordinary people have not prospered. What is prosperity when one cannot access a bed in a public hospital, when one's child attends a grossly overcrowded and usually dilapidated school and when one has little hope of ever owning one's own home? Let us face facts once and for all and admit that social partnership has delivered nothing for ordinary people.The Progressive Democrats and their cohorts, the mega-rich are probably laughing at this very moment at the gullibility of those ordinary people who took social partnership at face value and did not realise it is a con job. The smug right wingers that lead the PD-Fianna Fáil Cabinet are laughing because they have duped the ordinary people into believing they are being consulted on socio-economic issues when it is not the case. The workers of this State must overthrow the economic tyranny the Government is perpetuating.So-called social partnership is being used to facilitate the privatisation of essential services in this State. Privatisation of public utilities is central to the right-wing ideology that is driving the Fianna Fáil-PD Government. It is also notable that privatisation has been a feature of the period since the adoption of the social partnership model of industrial relations. Public utilities such as the telephone service, electricity, waste collection and transport have been or are due to be privatised. These utilities have been built using public money and therefore belong to the people. Sinn Féin is opposed to privatisation of national industries and services. We do not see why essential services should be sacrificed to private corporations interested only in profit and who would lay off thousands of workers and cut services.I ask Fianna Fáil backbenchers not to stand back and allow this to happen. I know they are worth more than that collectively. They should stand up to what is going on in Government and call a halt to it. After all, they also represent the workers of this State.

I have listened to the contributions of other Members and many of them have referred to the current state of the economy and the quality of life. I listened to the last contribution where the Deputy spoke about cutbacks in health and education. The Deputy can say such things as often as he likes; he can say it while swinging from the rafters. The reality is there are no cutbacks. The money spent on health this year is significantly – not marginally – greater. The Deputy did make one factually correct point. There are queues in hospitals and there are problems. The Deputy called on Fianna Fáil backbenchers to address the issues. We would gladly engage with him if he were prepared to talk about factual issues.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	700	I rise to support the Government amendment. I will focus in this debate on policing and criminal justice, particularly that part of the motion urging the Government to "promote all-Ireland policies and strategies across the full range of governmental responsibilities, recognising the benefits of an island-wide approach to public affairs for all the people of Ireland."  In Northern Ireland, policing has changed more in the past 18 months than in the previous 80 years with the continuing implementation of the Patten reforms. The work of the policing board, the Police Ombudsman, the Oversight Commissioner, Chief Constable Orde and the Inspector of Constabulary has ensured that the vision of new policing set out in the Patten report is being made a reality.In this jurisdiction I am in the course of introducing measures towards implementing the policing principles contained in the Good Friday Agreement. The Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland was set up pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement signed in Belfast in April 1998. That commission produced its report, known as the Patten report, in September 1999. The Patten report contained 175 recommendations. Nine of these related specifically to co-operation with the Garda Síochána. An intergovernmental agreement between Ireland and the UK on police co-operation was signed in Belfast on 29 April 2002. This agreement provides the basis for the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill, which in turn provides the legal framework for the implementation of certain Patten recommendations, in so far as they involve the Garda Síochána, as well as providing for ongoing enhancement of police co-operation.The Bill provides for the implementation of articles 1 and 2 of the intergovernmental agreement. Members of each police service are to be eligible to apply for certain posts in the other police service and a programme is to be put in place to enable members of each police service to be seconded with full police powers to the other police service for periods not exceeding three years. A further provision of the agreement provides for a programme of placements to be put in place to enable the transfer of experience and expertise, including in the area of training. This provision does not have any legislative implications as officers participating in that programme will not be exercising any police powers in the other jurisdiction. A formal protocol on these placements will be signed by the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable as soon as consultations with the Garda associations are finalised.In addition to these provisions of the agreement, I should also mention the ongoing strengthening of co-operation between the two services, which is exemplified in the holding of the first annual conference in our national Garda training college in Templemore in March of last year. The convening of annual conferences between the Garda and the PSNI is provided for in article 4 of the intergovernmental agreement and a follow-up conference is planned for later this year. Last week, under article 8 of the agreement, a joint emergency planning exercise by a joint Garda-PSNI major disaster team took place on the Fermanagh-Leitrim border under the auspices of a European Union project co-funded by my Department. This practical exercise simulated an air disaster and responses by the appropriate agencies from the two jurisdictions and was observed and analysed by experts from participating EU member states.Article 9 of the intergovernmental agreement provides for measures to be taken to facilitate joint investigations between the Garda and the PSNI, having regard to EU developments in this area. In this regard, Deputies will be aware that the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill has passed all stages in the Seanad and will be debated in this House shortly. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the requirements of an EU Council framework decision which provides for the setting up of joint investigation teams by mutual consent of member states for a specific purpose and for a limited period. The teams will carry out criminal investigations with a cross-border dimension in one or more of the member states setting up the team. Effective co-operation is of increasing importance in our efforts to combat transnational crime. Law enforcement agencies must actively implement measures agreed by Governments to ensure boundaries do not militate against effective co-operation. The establishment and operation of joint investigation teams represents such a measure.I have just returned from County Cavan, where a joint conference between the Garda and the PSNI has been in progress. The conference dealt with organised crime. I addressed the conference and spoke about the changing and evolving situation in policing in Northern Ireland. I indicated to the delegates at that conference that what we intend to produce in both parts of this island is a seamless dedication to the rule of law. I look forward to intensifying our relationship of co-operation with the PSNI with a view to ensuring that the rule of law applies right across this island and that organised crime cannot avail of the opportunity posed by the Border to defy the rule of law and the will of the people of this island, North and South.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	702	I also indicated to the conference that at official level, there has been agreement to explore, in the context of the full implementation of the legislative programme of which I speak and the protocols I have also mentioned, the possibility of further deepening the relationship by investigating whether aspects of the Schengen arrangements which apply between other states in the EU could also be applied in North-South policing co-operation. Officials will shortly meet to discuss issues such as cross-Border surveillance and hot pursuit, as well as the circumstances under which, with public support, those measures can be brought into operation in the fullness of time.The provisions of the EU framework decision interact with a number of the recommendations in the Patten report on policing in Northern Ireland, such as that the PSNI and the Garda Síochána should have written protocols covering key aspects of co-operation; that there should be a programme of long-term personnel exchanges between them in specialist areas, to which I have referred previously; and that consideration be given to establishing a provision for an immediate exchange of officers and pooling of investigative teams after major incidents with a substantial cross-Border dimension.Deputies will recall that the Good Friday Agreement provided for "a wide-ranging review of criminal justice (other than policing .  ) to be carried out by the British Government through a mechanism with an independent element, in consultation with the political parties and others."  A comprehensive review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, CJR, was carried out on foot of this commitment and published in March 2000. Areas the review recommends for consideration include personnel exchanges, mutual recognition of qualifications, information sharing – for example, on the misuse of drugs – dangerous offender registers, reciprocal arrangements for victim and witness support programmes, cross-Border facilities for youth conference orders and widening access to services such as forensic science and pathology across jurisdictional boundaries.In the three years since publication of the review, its 294 recommendations have been taken forward on a step-by-step basis. It is considered that now would be an appropriate time to begin making substantive progress on structured co-operation. To that end, a joint group of criminal justice policy makers, as specifically recommended by the review, comprising senior officials from my Department and the Northern Ireland Office, has already formed and met on an ad hoc basis – indeed, its first meeting was yesterday in Hillsborough Castle. This group will consider the advancement of co-operation in the areas identified in the review and will identify in due course new areas in which co-operation could be developed. The group will report back to the Ministers on a periodic basis. It has been tasked with the development of a formal work programme for approval by Ministers and will take this work forward over the summer.Nobody regrets more deeply than the Government that the agreement which was in our grasp a few short weeks ago eluded us. However, nobody is more determined than the Government that the progress of the Good Friday Agreement, although it encountered a setback in that falling out, should not be derailed or set aside. Of course the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and its outworkings involves the devolution of policing and home affairs matters to Northern Ireland on an agreed basis, if this can be worked out among the parties there. Nobody will be more active than my Department and the Government in ensuring the necessary momentum to bring that about is restored to the process. We believe, and we have made this clear in the past, that it was a major mistake to postpone the elections in Northern Ireland. We believe, notwithstanding that, that it is important the two Governments maintain their complete dedication to the principles of the joint declaration and not allow it to become a stalled agenda and that they should get on with implementing all the parts that can be implemented in the absence of the representative and executive institutions functioning as envisaged by the Agreement.The agenda on policing, security and criminal justice on both parts of this island is something which requires solid work. I am confident the democratic process will be restored, that the proper basis for its restoration will be put in place and that the parties in Northern Ireland who represent the will of the majority of people north and south of the Border and who support the Agreement, will have the opportunity to seek afresh an electoral mandate to get on with the job of rebuilding the representative and executive institutions. In the meantime, regarding the preservation of life and limb and the strengthening of co-operation between the two police services, I stress to the House that I am determined that there be no hiatus and that we should go from strength to greater strength, deepening the co-operation that now exists. We will not walk away from that agenda because not only do life and limb depend on it, but, in my view, the momentum of the Good Friday Agreement depends on the determination of the two Governments to sustain the process in practical ways such as those envisaged by the joint declaration.I support the Government amendment.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	703	What could be more damaging to a democracy than the postponement of an election? It is a serious step to deny people a say in the make-up of their representative assembly. The elections, and through them accountability to the people, is a cornerstone of civilised society. A dangerous vacuum and void has been created by their postponement. No doubt there will be further entrenchment in the heat of the summer season. It is more in the calm of an autumn that free and fair elections should be held and I look forward to them being held. Something equally damaging to a society, and in many ways a more serious threat to democracy, is the prevalence of paramilitary activity. It is a menacing threat that overshadows everyday life.Last week I visited Colombia and witnessed how damaging a tolerance of paramilitary activity can be. That society has been ravaged by violence. In an attempt to bring peace to the troubled land, governments in the past declared something of an amnesty for groups conducting vicious and sustained rampages throughout the country. The result is a society where people are constantly terrified and threatened by groups such as FARC. Bombings, murders and kidnappings are commonplace. Conservative estimates put the number of murders at upwards of 40,000 per annum. People are coerced into joining paramilitary groups. Countless women and children have been raped. Many flee rural areas into the squalor of the shanty towns of Bogota and other urban areas in an attempt to survive paramilitary activities.Clearly the situation in Colombia demonstrates the devastating consequences of allowing paramilitary activity to continue in society. There can be no toleration of violence. Butchering somebody's knees is intolerable. Tacit allowance of so-called punishment beatings by paramilitary groups is a slippery slope down which we should not descend. Authorities in Bogota, in an attempt to secure a lasting peace, have tolerated a certain amount of paramilitary activity while at the same time engaging people in a political process. That process did not work in Bogota and it will not work in Northern Ireland. Only a one-horse strategy, the single pursuit of democracy through the political process, can work. The complete embracing of the political order through elections is the only way forward.I call on Sinn Féin to denounce violence in simple terms which will be understood by those who will vote for the first time in these elections when held – the average 18 year old who will understand, by interpretation of its words, its denouncement of violence as it takes the single strategy towards peace, democracy and representative politics.The issue of representation for citizens from Northern Ireland in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is part of the Agreement, can be taken up with Seanad reform. We are all aware it will soon take place and have been requested to make submissions in that regard. We should explore the issue of an allowance for citizens from the North in our Seanad. That is how we can achieve representation for people from the North.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I fully agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Good Friday Agreement is a democratic imperative and that the primacy of politics must be respected if the peace process is to prosper. I am conscious of the sense of anger, hurt and frustration which is widely shared across the broad Nationalist community in Northern Ireland as a result of this postponement of the elections.For Nationalists, postponement is not a mere technical exercise that can be reinstated at a more convenient time. The Assembly elections which should have taken place tomorrow were about renewing the mandate of those who were entrusted as the representative custodians of the Good Friday Agreement. It was this Agreement, solemnly endorsed in referenda in both parts of this island, which allowed many Nationalists, for the first time, to feel at ease with the political status of Northern Ireland. The Agreement and its endorsement was the act of self-determination that, in Nationalist eyes, legitimised the current constitutional arrangements.If elections to a key institution of the Agreement can apparently be so lightly dispensed with, some Nationalists are questioning the democratic value of the wider process. This confusion and frustration is potentially destabilising and needs to be quickly dispelled. That can be done in two ways. First, by the two Governments proactively implementing their joint declaration, regardless of the political comfort zones of any party. If the joint declaration is a blueprint for implementing outstanding aspects of the Agreement, then there is no legitimate reason it should not proceed forthwith. Second, by making it clear and certain that elections will proceed as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than 15 November, as mentioned in the recent British legislation. Until the political parties in Northern Ireland are assured that elections will take place in the near term, they are unlikely to seriously engage and will not make the kind of fundamental moves that are required if the Assembly and Executive are to be sustainable. To those who ask what needs to be done, I paraphrase a US political slogan, "It's the elections, stupid."I am reassured by Deputy Cowen's remarks yesterday that, despite continuing suspension, the North-South bodies continue to carry out their important public functions. For far too long, both parts of this island lived with their backs to each other with wasteful consequences for economic and social development, as well as for normal human contact and understanding. I know from personal experience on the ground that the situation has been positively transformed over recent years. Much of this is due to the long-term pioneering work of the International Fund for Ireland and the various EU cross-Border programmes,As co-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I am aware of the significant goodwill that exists for the peace process among parliamentarians from England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. I am, therefore, disappointed that the Ulster Unionist Party has thus far declined to take its seats on a body which, by its constitution and ethos, ought to be a comfortable fit for Unionists. The body would be delighted to welcome the UUP on board and I am open at any time to enter into dialogue with that party to advance such an outcome.I was struck yesterday by the thoughtful remarks of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on dealing with the painful legacies of the past. My friend, colleague and former Tánaiste, John Wilson, did an excellent job in his work as victims' commissioner, which, of course, also included the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I commend the work of the inquiry of the former Chief Justice, the late Mr. Hamilton and, latterly, Mr. Justice Henry Barron on these atrocious bombings. I also pay tribute to the courage and commitment of the Justice for the Forgotten Group, whose members have vigorously pursued the truth over many years and have offered advice and support to the victims and relatives of victims of the bombings. The inquiry has to address the cross-jurisdictional aspects of these cases. It is extremely important, therefore, that all of the relevant material in the possession of the British authorities should be made available to Mr. Justice Barron and I know that this issue has been pursued by the Taoiseach at intergovernmental level.I look forward to the publication of Mr. Justice Barron's report. I hope that it will be published soon and that the Oireachtas committee which considers it will also be able to make a significant contribution to establishing the truth of what happened. Finding out the truth about these bombings will help bring some form of closure for the families and victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. After nearly 30 years, they deserve no less.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Government's amendment to the motion, and I propose to address a number of key issues which are dealt in the motion, in particular, the Cory and Stevens inquiries and the blight of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.Deputies will be aware that, arising out of a commitment made at Weston Park in August 2001, the two Governments appointed Mr. Justice Peter Cory in May of last year to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion. The Cory investigation covers the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Pat Finucane, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright. All these cases are a source of grave public concern, having given rise to serious allegations of collusion in both jurisdictions.Mr. Justice Cory is a retired Canadian Supreme Court judge and is highly regarded by the international legal community and by his peers. The Government greatly appreciates his commitment to completion of this important task and his willingness to commit considerable time and energy to it. The Government must be ready to provide any further help or guidance which he may require in connection with his work. Mr. Justice Cory has been working intensively to complete his task and I understand he will have completed his investigation by October of this year. I welcome the fact that both Governments are committed to publishing each of the final reports and, in the event that a public inquiry is recommended in any case, the relevant Government is committed to implementing that recommendation.The findings of the Stevens inquiry, as published by Sir John Stevens on 17 April last, are of the utmost gravity. He reported that there was evidence of collusion between members of the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries in the murders of Pat Finucane and Adam Lambert and that he believed that the murders could have been prevented. His conclusion that "Nationalists were known to be targeted but were not properly warned or protected", is gravely disturbing. The Stevens report reinforces the Government's view that a public inquiry is required to investigate all the circumstances surrounding Mr. Finucane's murder.It is important that the Government continues to closely monitor developments regarding all such allegations. They must be determined to deal with these issues. Only by a thorough, impartial and prompt examination of all the facts can confidence in the state's willingness to enforce the rule of law be restored, and the public assured that collusion is a thing of the past and that the necessary steps have been taken to guard against any possible recurrence.Over the past number of years, sectarian violence has blighted communities throughout Northern Ireland. This House is well aware of the grim succession of pipe-bomb attacks, assaults and murders which have been perpetrated solely for sectarian motives. The names of the communities who have suffered are all too familiar to us – Holy Cross school, the Short Strand, the Fountain area of Derry. The problem has been particularly acute during the marching season, a time when inter-community tensions are already running high. As we enter another marching season, therefore, it is in everybody's interests that we have a peaceful summer free of the type of sustained sectarian violence we have seen over the past couple of years. As it has in the past, the Government must continue to work closely with the British Government, the political parties and community representatives to address the issues surrounding sectarian violence.The real impetus for peace comes from the communities themselves. I know of much work that local community leaders on all sides have done to calm tensions and to limit the extent of violence. In that context, I welcome the initiatives which are currently being taken on both sides of the divide to address the challenges that will undoubtedly arise over the next few months. I ask the Government to continue to assist these efforts and to assist reconciliation.I know the House will therefore join with me in commending all those who carry out such important work and in urging all those who have influence in their community to work to secure a summer free of sectarian incidents and violence. A summer free from violence is of course a goal in itself, but it would also be a positive step in creating the optimum conditions for renewed political engagement and the holding of elections in the autumn.The Government amendment represents a full and balanced representation of the key issues, of which I have considered only two, which arise in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, and I therefore commend it to the House.

I welcomed that opportunity and I have taken the opportunity in the past, even recently, to speak to other colleagues. It is important that we do so. It is interesting for those of us privileged enough to be elected to Leinster House, and to political life generally, to share our experiences as we can discover that we are quite alike in many ways. We hear the same problems and the same observations from our constituents, and I made the point to our colleagues today that they also must tolerate other difficulties, which, to an enormous extent, we do not understand. We do not understand having to run the gauntlet around our constituencies. We do not understand having to suffer abuse and, indeed, intimidation to that extent.It is important that we are open enough to share these experiences and to meet colleagues at every opportunity. I hope that we, here in the Dáil, will have the opportunity soon enough to visit Belfast and Stormont. I would hope at that stage, as other Deputies, certainly on this side, have stated, that we would support the strong view that elections would take place. In that regard, I absolutely support the Taoiseach, my party leader, when he stated that he disagreed with the British Government's decision to postpone the elections because he said at the time that he believed that yet another postponement "causes more problems for the process than it solves". He also stated that despite disagreement "the strength and critical importance of the partnership between the two Governments will endure" and he added that the two Governments will continue to implement those aspects of the joint declaration which come within their competence.The Taoiseach also met Prime Minister Blair and he made the point again, reiterating the joint commitment to the peace process and stressing that there would be no re-negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. He also made it clear that progress has been made in recent weeks by the republican movement but it is essential, as he stated previously, that "we have clarity". The Prime Minister, on the occasion, stated "whatever the differences about the decisions that we took last week, we are absolutely united and determined to work together to bring this process forward."It is a good sign of the open Ireland of today that we have such a debate. I welcome it and I also welcome the presence in the House of our political colleagues from the North.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The amendment in the name of the Labour Party Members states:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:conscious of the universal desire for a genuine, just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland and throughout this island:– acknowledges the role of political parties, present and previous Governments and of many others who have made possible a peaceful evolution from a condition of continuing conflict, that cost over 3,000 lives and caused enormous damage and disruption, to one of paramilitary ceasefires, inclusive multi-party negotiations and a comprehensive political settlement;– reaffirms:– its support for the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed in referenda by the people of Ireland,– its commitment to the principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect enshrined in that Agreement, and– its determination to ensure the success of the Agreement process;– restates the primacy of the principle of consent set out in the Agreement as the agreed basis for the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and for any change to that status;– recognises both the political progress already brought about by the peace process and the Agreement, benefiting all the people of Ireland, as well as the continuing high priority that must be attached to promoting reconciliation and mutual respect and understanding between the communities in Northern Ireland and between North and South on this island;– records its appreciation of the work done and undertaken by the all-Ireland implementation bodies;– reiterates that the Agreement remains the agreed template for political progress in Northern Ireland and the sole sustainable basis for fair and honourable accommodation between unionism and nationalism;– maintains that an inclusive executive and assembly, grounded on trust in the commitment of all other participants, offer the only means whereby Northern Ireland can be governed in the best interests of both communities;– acknowledges that devolved government cannot be made to work effectively in circumstances where there has been a breakdown of trust between those involved and where commitment is seen to be either conditional or partial;– acknowledges the shared responsibility of the Irish and British Governments and of all other parties to the Agreement to ensure its success and to make the maximum effort to overcome all obstacles to full implementation, as mandated by the people;– fully supports the role of both Governments, in consultation with the parties, in establishing the conditions in which devolved government can be restored as soon as possible and where provision for its future suspension is removed from the Statute Book;– recalls the progress made in talks aimed at such restoration of the political institutions and at full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, as spelled out in the Joint Declaration of April 2003;–  emphasises that each community must have confidence in the commitment of the representatives of the other to the full operation and implementation of the Agreement;– believes it is not open to anyone to overturn the Agreement and block or frustrate the will of the people, as expressed in the first collective act of Irish self-determination since 1918;– recalls that the Agreement reaffirmed a ‘total and absolute commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means of resolving difficulties on political issues';– restates its belief that the disavowal of armed force or the threat of force and the removal of the causes of conflict are necessary and concomitant objectives and that the full rigours of the law must be used impartially and without hesitation to counter the destructive agendas of paramilitarism and sectarianism;– expresses concern at the continuing illegal activities of paramilitary organisations and believes those activities are an obstacle to political progress and an affront to the will of the people, democratically expressed;– wishes to see the transition from violence to exclusively democratic and peaceful means brought to an immediate, unambiguous and definitive conclusion and calls therefore on paramilitary organisations to bring to an end all activities inconsistent with the peace process, the terms of the Agreement and the rule of law;– welcomes the steps that were proposed to be taken by the IRA in this regard and encourages further concrete and specific development along these lines;– notes with grave concern the allegations of collusion in the commission of criminal acts, including murder between State security forces and paramilitary organisations and calls on both Governments to ensure that these claims are fully investigated and that wrongdoers are brought to justice; and– urges the two Governments to continue to work closely together both to maintain momentum in the ongoing political talks, to secure the earliest possible holding of elections for the Assembly and to bring about those acts of completion required from all sides to achieve full implementation of the Agreement.I have heard commentators say recently that the postponement of elections signals the end of the Good Friday Agreement. Such sentiments must be dismissed immediately. The best way to do so is for the Governments to bring the parties in the North back around the negotiating table at the earliest possible opportunity to agree a common way forward. It is the view of the Labour Party that using the Joint Declaration as the basis for finding common ground between the pro-Agreement parties is the best way to start. After all, the declaration itself was the result of talks between the two Governments and the parties. It addressed the outstanding issues of concern on paramilitarism, demilitarisation, criminal justice and further reform of policing.As such, it should be the starting point for any new initiative. Achieving agreement between all the parties on these issues will pave the way for progress. However, a month after the election postponement, it is worthwhile reflecting on why that decision was taken. Postponing the elections which were scheduled for tomorrow was regrettable. The long-term consequences of the postponement are impossible to gauge at this stage.The British and Irish Governments worked tirelessly with all parties in the North since last October to reinstate the institutions ahead of the May poll. Accusations from certain quarters that they were let down by the efforts of the Irish Government to resolve the deadlock are opportunist and seek to deflect attention away from the bad faith demonstrated by republicans over the past eight months.I am encouraged by comments from the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night that even though the Government disagreed with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair's decision, their focus is not on the blame game. Instead, they recognise the larger goal and the need to work together with the British Government to secure elections at the earliest possible opportunity.Even so, as my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, said during the Dáil debate following the breakdown of the negotiations:It is hard to find any normal reason that would justify the postponement of the elections. It is unacceptable that people can be arbitrarily deprived of the right to vote.I recognise that the situation in the North is one of fine political balance, but nothing can justify such a radical decision as the postponement of elections. If we support a proposition that the assumed outcome of an election becomes justification for not proceeding with it, we are on a dangerously slippery slope.Stalemate resulted from the lack of good grace on the republican side and the lack of courage from Unionists. A historic moment passed us by. Further recourse to put the blame on Government, Unionists or anyone else will get us nowhere. The danger is that we are now playing into the hands of the opponents of the Agreement. The onus is therefore on the Governments and the pro-Agreement parties to work together to retrieve the situation.However, we should not forget how close it was to a deal a little over a month ago. Optimism that a clear indication that paramilitary activity was at last at an end was lost in weeks of apparent procrastination and lack of clarity by the republican movement about its future intentions.Sinn Féin is a key element in the success of the peace process. It is both sad and surprising that it failed to convey, with the clarity that people throughout Ireland expect and are entitled to, the confidence that paramilitary activity is a thing of the past. People everywhere continue to be deeply frustrated at their failure to do so. The manner in which words had to be extracted from them in the final few weeks of negotiations contributed in no small measure to the erosion of confidence.It is my firm belief that should republicans confirm that paramilitarism is a thing of the past, should they agree to commit as full participants in the policing structures of the North, support for the Agreement and its institutions will surge. This view is supported by a recent poll in the Belfast Newsletter that put current support for the Agreement among the Unionist community at 35%, yet this figure jumps to nearly 75% when respondents are asked if they would support the Agreement if decommissioning and the acts of completion envisaged by the Agreement were concluded.Following the signing of the Agreement in 1998, thousands of middle class Unionists and Nationalists came out and voted in the referendum specifically because it promised an end to violence. Due to disappointment in the way things have developed in the North since then, they have stayed at home ever since rather than come out and supported those parties aiming to make the Agreement work.These people have a responsibility to engage in the political process and the key for all of us who support the Good Friday Agreement and want to see it work is to regain the confidence of these voters who have stayed away from the polling stations ever since and allowed the extremes to prosper.Similarly, should republicans declare a permanent end of paramilitary activities, Unionists must reciprocate. A commitment not to pull down institutions that the majority of people North and South have endorsed is the least we should expect from them in such circumstances. They must also commit to work all the institutions wholeheartedly in a spirit of partnership both within the North and between North and South. The failure of Unionist leaders to outline fully the benefits of such partnership has contributed to scepticism in the Nationalist community about their true commitment to working the Agreement.I welcome the fact that the British Government is already proceeding to implement some measures contained in the Joint Declaration. The dismantling of watchtowers is a sign to republicans and all others that they mean what they say about creating an entirely demilitarised society. This should not be a one-off symbolic act. If the British Government is serious about the declaration it should proceed with the revised criminal justice implementation plan.Sinn Féin has achieved nothing for the community it represents by staying off the Policing Board. Its seats have been taken by the DUP and the UUP and until it commits to helping to create the new beginning to policing in the North, it will be contributing to the hostility felt towards the police in certain areas rather than overcoming it.Given that elections have been postponed, the obvious question is what is to be done now? I believe that the bona fides of all parties in the North must be tested. Now that we all have it, the Joint Declaration represents the best way of doing so. In getting the pro-Agreement parties to reach a common understanding of, and common response to, the declaration we will have made substantial progress on policing, including the agreement of Sinn Féin to join the Policing Board, criminal justice, demilitarisation and a final and unambiguous commitment to an end to paramilitarism.The two Governments must convene all-party talks on this basis. The Joint Declaration was negotiated between the Governments and the parties in the North and represents the best way to find common ground for a way forward. We are heading into what is traditionally the danger period in the North, where a political vacuum stands a good chance of being filled by a variety of sectarian voices, activities and attitudes. Though there have been extremely welcome low-profile efforts to minimise the potential for disorder, we cannot allow this to squander all that has been achieved in the past decade.The implementation of the Joint Declaration now stands as the best hope of progress in the North. By convening all-party talks, the Government would be taking a step in the right direction that is fully inclusive rather than dealing separately and privately with republicans and Unionists and trying to stitch together an agreement between the two. The time for this bilateral approach is over – it has not worked. The move to multilateral talks must be the priority.The appalling revelations of collusion as revealed in the Stevens inquiry, combined with media allegations about Stakeknife, demand that both Governments fully investigate these claims to ensure wrongdoers are brought to justice. As the truth of what went on in the North over the past 30 years drips out, the public have the right to know of all measures taken by the State during that time. There are extremely delicate moral and political issues involved, but that should not be used as an excuse to hide what actually happened.Too often in recent times, the rights of the victims of the Troubles and their families have been forgotten in favour of maintaining the political status quo. If we are to put to bed all outstanding issues, the truth in relation to past atrocities whether they were committed by paramilitaries or State agencies must be revealed.Turning to the motion tabled by Sinn Féin, I recognise that the issue of northern parties achieving representation in the Oireachtas periodically arises in the House. Efforts have been under way to review the situation since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement five years ago, recognising the new context it created for political structures throughout Ireland. It is the Labour Party's view that the relationship and interaction between elected representatives in the North and in the Oireachtas should only be considered alongside full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. In the present context, such consideration serves only to distract us from the main issue of re-establishing the institutions created under the Agreement and using them as templates for future political structures North and South. This does not mean that accommodating elected representatives in the North in some fashion is out of the question. The terms in which Sinn Féin has chosen to present the issue in this debate do not recognise the efforts made through the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, of which I was a member. We held hearings and heard from a number of political parties, including Sinn Féin and the SDLP, which presented cases to the committee. This was a recognition that a new kind of relationship should be explored and considered by the committee. Recommendations were published and presented to the previous Government after consideration of the issues was completed.I can recall the discussions in the committee very clearly. There was cross-party agreement that the fact that cross-community representation was a significant factor should be recognised. We could not disregard the fact that the mandate that exists in Northern Ireland does not belong to any one community, but is instead a cross-community mandate. We had to take that factor into account in our deliberations about any proposals we were bringing forward. The Seanad is revisiting the issue of Oireachtas representation for northern politicians. I welcome the Seanad's explicit efforts, as part of its internal review, to explore ways of accommodating representation for people in the North. I anticipate that a way of resolving the matter will be found that is to the satisfaction of parties in the Oireachtas and in Northern Ireland. In the meantime, work must be done to revive the institutions created by the Good Friday Agreement – this must be the priority of all parties.I welcome the fact that a debate is taking place on the issues that have been raised. I am somewhat concerned, however, that the motion put down by the Sinn Féin Deputies, who are quite rightly in this House because they have been elected to it, is too narrow in its focus. It is too party political to encompass the requirements that are on all of us to try to ensure that the principles and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement are lived up to and realised for the benefit of all people living on this island. The amendment tabled by the Government is more comprehensive. It recognises the different dimensions that need to be addressed, as well as the political imperative to try to ensure that there is movement forward, despite the fact that there is universal disappointment and regret that the elections have not been called. There is a recognition in all parts of the House that the elections should have gone ahead, as there is something undemocratic about the idea of not holding elections even though they are due because one does not like the possible outcome that might arise from them. I recall that Governments chose to postpone local elections because they were able to do so. Local elections were delayed for up to 13 years at one time because their likely outcome was not desired by the Government. It is a practice that we cannot support, regardless of the circumstances.I would like to refer to the long amendment, which deserves support, that my party tabled to this motion. Its length results from its comprehensiveness, as it attempts to cover all aspects of the political challenge that is faced by all of us, particularly the parties in Northern Ireland that want to realise the Good Friday Agreement. My party's amendment states that the Labour Party:– expresses concern at the continuing illegal activities of paramilitary organisations and believes those activities are an obstacle to political progress and an affront to the will of the people, democratically expressed;–  wishes to see the transition from violence to exclusively democratic and peaceful means brought to an immediate, unambiguous and definitive conclusion and calls therefore on paramilitary organisations to bring to an end all activities inconsistent with the peace process, the terms of the Agreement and the rule of law;– welcomes the steps that were proposed to be taken by the IRA in this regard and encourages further concrete and specific development along these linesThese important points need to be introduced into this debate. One should consider that close family members are in a state of desperate anxiety following the disappearance of Gareth O'Connor from County Armagh. As we try to establish true peace in Northern Ireland, we should recognise that people are still being affected by serious illegal activities that can lead to terrible wounds being inflicted on families, many of whom have suffered already and should never have to suffer in the same way again. Their hurt and pain has to be central to our concerns. People have suffered terribly across the communities in Northern Ireland as a result of many factors, particularly the fact that paramilitarism, from all sides, has not yet been put firmly and totally into the past. We should all unite around such an objective. On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to state that its members will support the Government's amendment.

Five years on, the Agreement, having survived numerous storms, setbacks and crises, still represents the outstanding vehicle for enabling conflicts to be resolved with the agreed and inclusive co-operation of all parties in the North, based on the democratic mandate bestowed on it by a popular vote. The unlimited potential for success of the peace process was clearly demonstrated by the smooth and efficient functioning of the institutions. Devolution worked extremely well and achieved strong support and respect from people in both communities. The limited experience of the Executive and the Assembly also provided clear evidence of the undoubted flair for the operation of the institutions of government on all sides in the Executive. Notwithstanding their apparent reluctance to operate the institutions, the participation of DUP Ministers was of particular significance.A month ago, the various political parties in the North had revved up their machines in preparation for the Assembly elections, published their literature and manifestos and incurred considerable expense in planning their election campaigns. The edict which came from the Secretary of State on 1 May, with the tacit approval of both Governments, scuttled the elections and delayed indefinitely the restoration of the North's democratic institutions.Five years to the day from the Good Friday Agreement, the parties came tantalisingly close to a sounder and firmer restoration of the institutions, to be followed by elections to a renewed Assembly. Mere differences of semantics together with a lack of trust proved to be the stumbling blocks on which the hopes of everyone foundered. Thus the people of Northern Ireland were prevented from exercising their right to vote, making a mockery of any pretence of democracy in the North, and putting the embattled peace process in greater jeopardy.The political vacuum thus created will be filled by right-wing extremists, marching season backwoodsmen and anti-Agreement dinosaurs, with the democratic process seriously compromised to prevent the implosion of mainstream unionism and its meltdown and humiliation by DUP hardliners. Mainstream Unionists looked likely to receive a hammering at the polls had they gone ahead on 29 May as previously planned. Moving the political goal posts to a new autumn deadline will put a virtually unbearable strain on democracy, and perhaps terminally damage the peace process.There is also the concern that the political vacuum could be filled by a resurgence of sectarian violence and politically-motivated tensions during the marching season, if previous summers of discontent are any guide. The peace process could thus conceivably be in even greater jeopardy from the latest deferral of the Assembly elections until the autumn in an effort to save the Agreement than if they were to proceed as previously arranged in late May.There is deep resentment and palpable anger among the Nationalist community, and across a much wider political spectrum in the North, that the integrity of the elections has been undermined with the sole purpose of preventing an outcome unfavourable to official unionism.

The Good Friday Agreement, devolved institutions and the electoral process will eventually have to prevail, together with the will of the electorate.Full across-the-board political participation in the policing board will be a prerequisite of establishing confidence in the North's new police service and achieving a truly representative cross-community Police Service of Northern Ireland. However, recent revelations about collusion with paramilitaries will have set such a situation back considerably.The Good Friday Agreement has been described as the only game in town. The cross-Border bodies have worked well, as all sides have acknowledged, and much useful work was accomplished by the Executive and Assembly during their sporadic terms of office. Assembly elections are necessary to clear the air and the sooner the better. That is preferable to permitting the vacuum to persist throughout the long, hot summer and marching season.Most people in Northern Ireland would prefer to see fresh elections in the North at the earliest date, preferably before the end of June. The viability of the entire election process and participation by a wide variety of parties should not be made conditional on a declaration of intent by any individual party.It is past time for the people to be consulted again and for the parties to be given a fresh mandate, irrespective of the outcome.

In many cases the language is similar and while the emphasis is different on specific issues, the general thrust is the same, namely, reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement as endorsed in referenda by the people of Ireland.As with almost everything involving the relationship between the communities in Northern Ireland and the political elements North and South – and east and west – very little is susceptible to simple solutions. I do not propose any solutions, just a few personal reflections. As I have said in other fora, sometimes it is easy to talk the talk on Northern Ireland but the real test is to walk the walk. One of the proposals in the Sinn Féin motion which is not mirrored in any of the amendments is to provide for representation in the Dáil for citizens of the Six Counties. This is an interesting proposal and while most of us would abide by the maxim – no taxation without representation – the proposal has a great deal of merit. I am not sure what formula could be found to allow all public representatives to put forward their views in the Dáil and Seanad. As Deputy Fiona O'Malley suggested, it may be possible in the context of Seanad reform, which is worthy of consideration.Recently, the vice-chairman of the policing board, Mr. Denis Bradley, expressed his anger at the Government's perceived lack of action following the decision of the British Government to defer elections to the Assembly. He was right to be angry – as were all constitutional democrats on the island – at the unnecessary and harmful erosion of democratic politics in Northern Ireland. Whatever the perceived problems of the Ulster Unionist Party – and we recognise that Mr. Trimble faces continuous internal harassment – the elections should not have been deferred. It is difficult to understand how the British Government could have taken the decision, bearing in mind its constant urging of the people of the North to seek a solution to problems through the democratic system. The British Government cannot have it both ways. Justice delayed is justice denied. We can apply the same principle here; democracy delayed is democracy denied.Speaking of Mr. Trimble's problems, it is interesting to see one of them, in the form of Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson, responding to a speech by the President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, in which the hand of friendship was extended to Unionists. Mr. Donaldson responded by challenging Sinn Féin to support a move to permit the Orange Order to parade down the Garvaghy Road. I consider this to be a possible opportunity for generosity and practicality; generosity in having a reason to respond positively to Mr. Donaldson and practicality in finding a solution to the annual hotspot of the marching season. Who wins if the Orange Order asks to march down the Garvaghy Road and the Garvaghy residents allow it if it complies with certain reasonable conditions? Both sides win. I am not advocating this as a simple stroke of a pen solution but I believe some such outcome would represent an important gain in that, if permission was requested and given, the norm could be established that if one wishes to walk through a certain community then one may do so, but one cannot walk on that community.A second good reason to react positively to Mr. Donaldson would be an opportunity to throw back a challenge to him in regard to the imminent move to separate the Orange Order from the Ulster Unionist Party. The manipulation of the UUP by the Orange Order is one of the primary negative forces acting against peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Jeffrey Donaldson, in addition to challenging Sinn Féin, should be prepared to challenge the elements in his party and among the loyalist community to separate church and state and to follow the lead set by the Republic.In the interests of ensuring an equitable and transparent administration of justice in the North, and in the interests of further eroding the position of obdurate Unionists, I suggest that Sinn Féin joins the policing board. The party could have a positive influence on the development of the PSNI and despite the difficulties – and I do not minimise them – that decision should be taken before the marching season gets under way.In this House and in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I have spoken on some of the long-term measures that must be taken to secure a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Foremost in this regard is achieving integration between the communities and the important role that integrated education can play. I commend Sinn Féin for its enlightened policy on integrated education and suggest that others should take it on board.

Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht. Ba cheart dúinn a bheith ag súil le toghchán ó thuaidh amárach. Tá cúig bliain caite ó bhí na reifrinn ann agus tá sé in am dúinn an cheist a plé agus dul chun cinn éigin a dhéanamh.The motions before the House are very similar. There is little to distinguish them except the differences of emphasis and, in the case of Northern Ireland, differences of emphasis can make the difference between agreeing something or not. This is a time of log-jam and there is a need to progress issues. It is important that we progress issues that build bridges rather than divide.In that sense, the Government amendment takes that matter into account more wholeheartedly than the Sinn Féin motion, which deals, understandably from the point of view of their policies, with an all-Ireland dimension to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.It is important to bear in mind the need for balance as well as clarity. On many occasions in this House we have spoken about the need for clarity and for all paramilitaries to say that their paramilitary activities are over. Those on the republican side wonder why the IRA is being picked out when the loyalists have been as ruthless, if not more so, in their history. The reality is that Sinn Féin has been given the trust and honour to represent the people in the Executive and there is, naturally, a big onus on accountability in that regard. That being said, there is a need to emphasise the cross-community nature of paramilitarism at every opportunity. The Governments also need to come clean about the level of collusion, however, which is an aspect that concerns not only the British Government but also the Irish Government. We need reassurances that the intelligence services are operating within the rule of law and both Governments have a responsibility to be clear about that. Similarly, the Unionists, who at this stage have a reputation for dragging down the institutions, need to make it clear that they are prepared to sustain the institutions and ride the political storms that inevitably tend to arise from peace processes anywhere in the world.In the current set of circumstances, it would be unwise to take initiatives that go beyond the immediate provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, notwithstanding the enthusiasm for putting them in place. We are still a long way from having the Good Friday Agreement fully implemented. Furthermore, any such extension to North-South initiatives should follow consultations with all the parties represented in the Assembly, rather than as a unilateral move on the part of the Dáil. While it may be tempting to deliver such a tit-for-tat response to the UK Government following its unilateral suspension of elections, it is difficult to see how it would help to get us out of the current impasse.An area of the Good Friday Agreement which has not been acted upon is the commitment to explore the interparliamentary North-South body. We already have a British-Irish Interparliamentary Body which meets to debate areas of common interest. I understand that interest will be extended to the football field at Old Trafford where a team comprising representatives of Dáil Éireann will play against Westminster. To that extent at least, things are alive and healthy in sporting terms, whatever about politics. I wish our colleagues, including Deputy Finian McGrath, well in that regard.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The Green Party has no objection in principle to MLAs having speaking rights in the Dáil but now is not the right time to proceed with such an initiative. We must be careful to build up trust, particularly at such a difficult time with the marching season coming upon us. That will really be a test for each side, as well as being a test for the police and the security forces generally. I pay tribute to those people from Nationalist backgrounds who have taken the brave step of joining the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I know they are in a minority and have to face considerable odds in terms of their role within the community they serve but they are displaying a level of service to their fellow citizens and a trust in the process of democracy and law that is needed at a difficult time. People living in the North know much better than those in Dublin about the difficulties involved.It is not often that we turn to a publication such as the New Scientist to help us through a log-jam. A recent edition of that magazine contained an article on what brings about human trust within a community. We are used to hearing about Machiavellian traits of intelligence in trying to outwit rivals, whether in seeking a mate, food or political status. It certainly seems to preoccupy our thinking in politics but there is an equally important factor of research into what brings about trust in a community. A new field of science called neuro-economics has identified a human trust chemical in the brain, called an oxytocin. I wish we could bottle it for sale or even give it away to many people.

It is generally created by what could be called generous acts of trust, which means taking risks. People have taken many risks concerning the Good Friday Agreement but obviously much more needs to be done.It is intriguing, as the New Scientist article tells us, that the urge to respond positively is there when someone shows trust to us and it is largely outside our control. I would like to believe that but in regard to the North one tends to be sceptical even about research of this nature. We will have to examine every avenue to see how we can move forward. The article states that trust is one of the most powerful factors affecting a country's economic health. Where trust is low, individuals and organisations are more wary about engaging in financial transactions so there is a huge knock-on effect in a community where trust is lacking. The article makes comparisons with Scandinavia where they have measured what is called the stranger-danger phenomenon, which is present in a community where trust is low and people are suspicious of those they do not know – they assume the worst in terms of their motives. Northern Ireland would be a fascinating case study for the New Scientist magazine to see where a society that is so lacking in trust is going.This is not a good time for generating a climate of trust, given that the unilateral decision by the British Government to suspend elections has brought about a political vacuum which is so dangerous. In the current impasse, it is important for the policing issue to be advanced and for the Stevens and Cory inquiries to be addressed and their recommendations implemented. Until the policing issue is sorted out we will, unfortunately, be faced with that level of mistrust, which will prevent progress.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I appreciate the thoughtful and considered contributions to the debate, which have been made on all sides of the House, both today and yesterday. The commitment on all sides to the full implementation of the Agreement will strengthen our resolve as we continue with our work to address the current impasse.Returning to the issues raised by Opposition speakers, I would like to respond to some of the key points. I wish to tell Deputy McManus that there is no question mark over the Government's commitment to the complete cessation of all forms of paramilitary activity and violence in society. Paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration refers to such activities in great detail. The emphasis the Government lays on this requirement was clearly demonstrated in the recent negotiations during which, regrettably, we failed to achieve the required clarity.On the erroneous suggestion that the Government in some way acquiesced in the postponement of the elections, I will do no more than refer Deputies to the statement made by the Taoiseach on 1 May, in which he made it abundantly clear that the Government did not agree with the British Government's decision and that the postponement of elections caused more problems than it solved. Our disagreement was expressed frankly, both in private and in public. The Government can only do what is within its power. If the Government had been legally required under the Good Friday Agreement to agree for elections to be deferred, it would not have done so.Moving on from that fundamental disagreement was never going to be easy. However, we remain fully committed to mapping a way forward, together with the parties and the British Government. I welcome the fact that the recent legislation in the British Parliament has effectively provided a target date for the holding of Assembly elections because, in our view, the best way to restore political momentum is for elections to take place. Our amendment calls for those elections to take place, "quickly and, regardless of any other considerations, no later than the autumn".With regard to the Fine Gael proposal that the Government should immediately convene round-table talks, I fully recognise that the Good Friday Agreement was the result of a process of collective engagement, and also that a vital role is played by continuing collective engagement in the process. In the months before the publication of the joint declaration, we all took part in a full round of collective meetings, some of which I co-chaired with the Northern Ireland Office Minister, Des Browne, addressing such issues as human rights, equality, victims and disadvantage. The tangible result of that engagement is to be seen in the joint declaration published recently.Following that strong collective engagement, we are, as a first step, now taking part in a series of bilateral meetings, including recent contacts with the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party. Following these bilateral contacts, we will consider what the most appropriate and conducive method of moving the political process forward will be – mindful of the two key issues which remain to be resolved – the need for an end to paramilitarism and for the stability of the institutions to be guaranteed. With regard to the latter issue, this evening's report that a further UUC meeting may be convened in June is reflective of the continuing strains within unionism.As the Minister for Foreign Affairs did yesterday, I recognise the constructive purpose underlying the motion tabled by Sinn Féin and welcome the opportunity to have had this positive and useful debate. Similarly, I appreciate the approach and helpful nature of the amendments tabled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. It is clear that there is a broad degree of agreement throughout the House on these issues and the areas of divergence between the motion and those amendments are not ones of serious import.However, I believe the Government amendment represents both a reasonable and wide-ranging expression of attitudes in the House as a whole. I commend it to Dáil Éireann and ask others who have tabled amendments to consider supporting the Government's motion.

Working class people living on the Shankill, Sandy Row or the Waterside know only too well that it was not much warmer for them. All the parties and Deputies in this House espouse the notion of an Ireland based on equality, justice and peace. The Good Friday Agreement attempted to put that concept into legislative form. I do not believe that the historic comprises contained in that document would have been possible without all those groups and individuals seeing beyond their own concerns and accepting the new potential the Agreement opened up. It is true that we have more in common than divides us.The peace process was kick started by dialogue, complemented by the historic cessations and overwhelmingly embraced by the Irish people, North and South. It gave a sense of hope to people not only in Ireland but also throughout the world. From day one it has been bedevilled by crisis after crisis but, despite all the difficulties, the process of dialogue has and continues to move us forward and away from conflict.Republicans on this island have had to make painful and difficult decisions in order to support that process. We acknowledge that we have inflicted great hurt on many from the Unionist tradition and continue to articulate and, more importantly, demonstrate our understanding of that reality. All of us are emerging, slowly maybe, painfully certainly, but we are emerging out of a 30-year conflict that has affected and lessened each one of us. We all want to see a just society and the fault lines of sectarianism removed forever. We have gone from the bad old days of Unionists disinfecting council seats, from refusing to sit in the same room to negotiating face to face, to even sharing power. I want to see change brought about by exclusively democratic and peaceful means. We want to see the conflict over and done with. That is what the motion before us is trying to do. It is about the primacy of politics which involves removing all of the guns out of the equation.There are still fault lines in the process. The Good Friday Agreement is not and has not been implemented fully by all sides. The potential for conflict is still with us. The cancellation of the democratic process, because of the possible outcome, does not augur well for the future. Sinn Féin understands that we need to reach out to the Unionist community, and we are doing so quietly on a daily basis. Alex Maskey in the first 12 months of office has confronted the prejudices that existed about him. He has begun to build what he called a city of equals in his acceptance speech. As Lord Mayor of Belfast he handled, in an inclusive manner, the Remembrance Sunday commemorations. He demonstrated vividly the lengths to which republicans are prepared to go to show that parity of esteem, equality and inclusiveness are not merely words, but must be acted on.Unionism and its leaders need to understand that equality is not a concession, it is the right of everyone. Justice is not a concession, it is a right. A police service acceptable to all communities is not a concession, it is desirable and necessary for everyone. The removal of the weapons of war, the intrusive watchtowers and the armed patrols is not a concession to republicans but a necessity if we are to move to a peaceful society. Sinn Féin is ready to move forward. We are ready to bridge the gap but we need to know from unionism and the British that they are prepared to work with us towards that new Ireland.As most speakers have agreed with the substance of this motion, it is disappointing that parties in this House did not feel comfortable supporting the Sinn Féin motion. I am disappointed that there is not a genuine effort to move the situation forward. I welcome the focus the motion creates on what has to be done to bring peace with justice to this island.

B'fhiú an díospóireacht í agus tá súil agam go bhfuil tuiscint níos fearr againn uile mar thoradh uirthi.I would like to welcome my Sinn Féin colleagues who have travelled from north of the Border to be with us. I welcome in particular our party president, Gerry Adams, MP, the MP for Fermanagh-South Tyrone, Michelle Gildernew, the MP for Mid-Ulster, Martin McGuinness, our party chairperson, Mitchell McLaughlin, and the former Minister for health in the Assembly, Bairbre de Brún. There are other colleagues also in the Visitors Gallery. We regret that our MPs, or Deputies, from constituencies north of the Border, are unable at this point to join us in this important debate on the floor of the Chamber. It is something we have pursued actively and we welcome the stated intent of the Taoiseach to have this matter expedited and addressed in the autumn session.While regretting that our colleague MPs are unable to join us this evening, I want to make it abundantly clear that we also regret the fact that all 18 MPs for the northern constituencies are unable to be with us here today. I want to put on record that we look forward to the day when all 18 MPs will have the opportunity to represent their particular analysis and outlook in a debate on this issue or on related matters. I hope and expect that day is approaching, which is something I hope to be here to welcome.It is important to acknowledge at this juncture the Government's agreement in its amendment to our motion that the issue of northern representation in the Oireachtas should be taken forward by agreement in both the Dáil and Seanad and that that should happen before the end of this session. I ask the Government to adopt motion 54a on the Order Paper, in the name of the Sinn Féin Members, which, inter alia, states:Members of Parliament elected to constituencies comprising in whole or in part Counties Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone shall have the right to speak in the Dáil, subject to the foregoing Standing Orders as they apply to Teachtaí Dála.I refer the Taoiseach and the Minister to this text, which is offered as a proposition to facilitate them in something they will have to address, either by that or some other formula they will present. I hope they will move on this matter with the speed to which the Taoiseach is committed.I welcome the Sinn Féin Assembly Members who are present in the Visitors Gallery. We are on the eve of what should have been a very significant day for them and for all democrats on this island. Tomorrow, 29 May 2003, should have been polling day and these colleagues should have been at eve of poll activities tonight, something with which we are all familiar. However, not for the first time, the British Government has intervened and violated the democratic rights of the Irish people.There is cross-party agreement in the Oireachtas, as reflected in this debate, that this decision was wrong. The decision of Tony Blair and the British Government to cancel an Irish election is offensive, not only to the Irish electorate in the Six Counties, but to Irish democrats throughout the island. I repeat the call I have made to the Taoiseach over the past couple of weeks that the election should be rescheduled for the end of June. I again ask the Minister to use this opportunity to press the British Government to bring it forward and not to leave it until "no later than the autumn", as stated in the Government amendment to the motion. While I welcome this firm and emphatic statement, we appeal to the Minister to use his position to have the election brought forward to the coming month. Either way, it is the overwhelming opinion throughout the island that the British Government has intervened in an unacceptable and unilateral way and that the elections should take place as soon as is practically possible.There were one or two contributions to this debate I would reject, in whole or in part, and but for time restrictions I would respond to them directly. I will resist the temptation to make an exception with regard to some of what Deputy McManus had to say because I will later refer to the Labour Party amendment.When the Minister addressed the issue of the election during this debate, he stated: "If the Irish Government had been legally required under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement to sign for elections to be cancelled it would not have been done." I welcome that. The Minister went on to state: "We can only do what is within our power."  That is a revealing remark. It shows that the Government has been placed in a totally unacceptable situation by the British Government. The logical political conclusion is that the power to unilaterally cancel Assembly elections, and to not only suspend but collapse the institutions, seems to rest solely with the British Government. This is something Sinn Féin roundly rejects. I believe Irish and international opinion would also reject it.The Government is a co-equal partner in the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish people expect that it has co-equal responsibility and say in all matters pertaining to the Agreement. I urge the Government to push for the removal of that power from Westminster and the hands of the British Prime Minister. It is an imperative that this be addressed and that we do not see repeats of this now oft-repeated slight on the part of the British establishment. The Government and the Dáil must give leadership. We must stand united in opposition to the decision of the British Government to cancel the democratic elections that were scheduled to take place tomorrow.There is much common ground in the Sinn Féin motion and the amendments moved by the Government, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party. That includes a reaffirmation on the part of all of us of our support for the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. The essential role of the all-Ireland Ministerial Council and the all-Ireland bodies is also affirmed.Very importantly, there is a growing recognition of the role of systematic collusion between the British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries in the conflict and the need for truth and justice to emerge. That systematic collusion has never been confined to the Six Counties and there is a growing body of evidence that British state forces were involved in all the attacks perpetrated by loyalists in the Twenty-six Counties over the period from the early 1970s. The purpose was clear. It was not to target republicans, as it may first have seemed, but to intimidate the Irish people in general and the Government in particular, and to deter them from fulfilling their proper role in vindicating the rights of Nationalists throughout this island. Therefore, I must again urge for a stronger stand by the Government on this, recognising that the British under-cover effort is continuing and needs to be challenged at every opportunity.The vote tonight will be taken on the Government amendment. While I repeat my welcome for the predominantly positive tone and content of the amendment, reflecting as it does all the issues raised in the Sinn Féin motion, I say with regret that the Sinn Féin Deputies cannot accept it. In drafting our motion, we sought to present a common approach, realising the great importance of having a united House on this issue. Regrettably, while the Government amendment recalls the progress made in the recent talks, it also recalls "the disappointing failure to achieve the required clarity on the completion of the transition from paramilitarism to exclusively peaceful means."  The Minister is aware that the Government drafters of this amendment know that this is something we can neither accept nor agree to.Of whom is clarity required? I and many people on this land believe there was sufficient clarity and that the initiative on the part of the IRA was unprecedented. The IRA leadership made clear in its statement that it is determined that its activities will be consistent with its resolve to see the complete and final closure of the conflict. Our party president, Gerry Adams MP, made clear that the IRA leadership is determined that there will be no activities which will undermine in any way the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. With regard to the thoughtful contribution by our colleague, Deputy Harkin, Gerry Adams has responded positively to Jeffrey Donaldson but, regrettably, to date, The Irish Times has yet to report the response.We in Sinn Féin have fulfilled our obligations under the Agreement. We will not accept special strictures on our party over and above those which apply to any other and outside the terms of the Agreement itself. The current, very serious impasse in the process will be overcome. I wish to finish on that positive note. That can only be done, of course, on the basis of equality. The peace process and the Good Friday Agreement represent the way forward for all our people. While we will take up different voting positions when the Ceann Comhairle calls for the vote here this evening, I state our determination to go forward in the interests of all the people, facing the challenges of today and tomorrow and embracing together our shared future on this island.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I rise with anger at the Government, particularly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who made a commitment regarding jobs in County Mayo. This week the Government proved that it has no interest in the people in Mayo or in jobs there. I will describe what happened in the past month. A factory in Ballinrobe was owned by a company that went into liquidation. A man bought the assets of that company and entered into an agreement with IDA Ireland that he would buy the factory for €775,000. The factory has lain idle for over 20 years and the State and the taxpayers will pay €120,000 for the next 15 years to the man who owns the factory. This week this company thought that it had entered into an agreement with IDA Ireland to buy a factory and get employment grants, but IDA Ireland did not see fit to provide the company with grants to employ 75 people over the next four years. It is appalling that the IDA entered into an agreement 20 years ago with private investors and having regard to what it paid them in rent for the factory for the past 20 years, it will pay them €120,000 for the next 15 years for an empty factory. That would not happen in a Third World country. It would not happen in Iraq when it was in its worst state, but it happening here. This company was prepared to invest in this country and to employ people, but the IDA could not see fit this week to give it employment grants to employ these people.I ask the Minister to immediately investigate the following matters: why the IDA is paying somebody €120,000 for an empty factor; why the IDA did not enter into an agreement with this company; who made that decision; why was it made; and is the Government interested in providing jobs for County Mayo? We know that the three towns in Mayo it is interested in are Westport, Ballina and Castlebar. This was the only chance Ballinrobe had of creating employment in this factory.The Government must immediately enter into negotiations with this company, which took its business out of this country today and brought it to Northern Ireland and to Wales where it will create jobs that could have been created in County Mayo.I am sharing my time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn. I will let her take over from me and I hope she will agree with me.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	726	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for agreeing to allow me raise this matter. I wish to comment on a number of points made by Deputy Ring. I would like to explain the background to this matter but first I wish to thank the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, for taking time in recent days to speak with me on this matter and to talk to the IDA.I will put this matter into context. There is a company called Silflex. It is interested in setting up business in Ballinrobe. It is a manufacturer of silicone hoses and is based in Wales. It does not sell to the automotive industry but to private individuals who are car enthusiasts. It manufactures a niche product. If one reads car magazines, which I must confess I do not, one will come across the name of a company called Vanko, which is the product it manufactures. This company is 13 years old and in the past ten years it grew by 20% compound year-on-year. It exports worldwide to 37 countries as far away as Japan. It has sales of €4 million in 2002 and it has 102 employees. By anyone's reckoning it is a successful company that has been in existence a long time.This company wants to create 15 jobs in Ballinrobe in a year and to increase that number to 75 jobs over three years. It is prepared to invest €1.1 million of its own money in Ballinrobe. It will buy a factory that the IDA built 20 years ago for a market value of €755,000 – a figure determined by valuers brought in by the IDA. It will equip the factory with electrics at a cost of €150,000 and buy plant from Ablecrest, a company that formerly operated there, at a cost of €368,000, all of which amounts to an investment of €1.1 million of its own money.What has the IDA offered this company that is prepared to do all this for the town of Ballinrobe which has been starved of jobs by the IDA? The IDA is prepared to offer it €3,300 for every job created, which would amount to €247,000 over the period involved. If I was to set up a cottage industry in my back garden and approach my local county enterprise board, I would get €6,600 per job. The offer of €3,300 per job by the IDA is a disgrace. The IDA will sell this company and get it off its hands at a market value for €755,000.I wish to set out the facts about this advance factory. I appreciate that I do not have much time, but I ask the Minister of State to bear with me on this point because unless he can give me good news, I believe this point is worth making. Some 20 years ago an advance factory was built in Ballinrobe. This was policy around the country at the time. In the past 20 years the IDA has paid more than €2 million in rent for a factory that, by its own admission, has remained empty. If that factory was to remain empty over the next 15 years, the IDA would pay a further €2 million in respect of it. That would represent throwing some €4 million of taxpayers' money down the drain. All I am asking the IDA to do is to up its offer to this company by €200,000.

A PR person on behalf of the IDA went on radio today and said that the level of its offer to this company was €1.25 million and accused this company of been greedy in looking for additional money. That was a lie and I want to lay it to rest. The IDA is trying to offload a loss that it would make on a bad deal done 20 years ago to a company, but all this company wants to do is to create jobs.

The Minister of State should not allow the pride of a person who made a bad decision in the IDA and who wants to palm off a loss that the IDA would make for a bad decision made 20 years ago, to intervene in this regard. He should not allow the IDA to do that. This is far too important an issue. If the IDA acts in this regard, its balance sheet will show a loss of €750,000, but is that not better than throwing a further €2 million of taxpayers' money down the drain? I thank the Chair for its patience.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	734	I thank Deputies Ring and Cooper-Flynn for their comments. I am conscious, as is the Minister, Deputy Harney, of the need to attract new investment into County Mayo and particularly into Ballinrobe. I agree with the Deputies that it is disappointing that it has not been possible to bring the negotiations with this company to a successful conclusion. I am assured that everything possible is being done to make locating in Ballinrobe an attractive proposition for the company and I would regret if it was to make the commercial decision to locate the project elsewhere. However, the IDA's negotiations with the promoter are continuing and its position is that it is open to negotiating a higher rate of subvention for a more advanced integrated manufacturing proposition which the promoter might wish to contemplate. That negotiation is continuing.It would be inappropriate for the Minister or for anyone else in Government to second guess the IDA's judgment in deciding the appropriate level of assistance warranted in the case of individual projects. IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility, assigned to it by the Oireachtas, for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the State and its regions. Negotiations on grants or on the management of IDA's industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. It is not a matter for Ministers, the Government or for Dáil Éireann. The law sets out the responsibilities clearly. It is the IDA that evaluates proposals and that decides how to negotiate to get value for the country. It has done so in this case, as in all others, and it is convinced that its negotiating stance is the most appropriate in view of the proposal. The effective grant cost per job, taking into account both the property deal proposed and the employment grant, is substantial for the project in question which is a basic manufacturing and assembly operation.In my experience and that of the Department, it is unprecedented to debate in the House the negotiating tactics of the IDA during a negotiation. It would be a pity if every time a promoter was negotiating for more cash, a parliamentary debate was used in an effort to put pressure on the IDA.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	739	A reason Ireland has had so singular a success in attracting foreign investment, compared to other countries, is that the negotiation of deals is a matter for the IDA. It must remain that way.The IDA's track record is second to none. It is perhaps the most professional investment agency in the world. It is highly respected by its counterparts around the globe who constantly seek to emulate its success in attracting foreign investment into the country. In the past 12 months alone, 44 IDA backed projects forecasting more than 8,000 jobs have been announced.In the case of the building in Ballinrobe, to which the Deputies refer, it is owned by a private company and has been vacant for most of the past 20 years. On 2 January 1983, IDA Ireland took out a 35-year lease on the building, with rent reviews every five years. The annual rent, up until January 2003, was €92,481 per annum and the agency is currently involved in rent negotiations with the owners. I heard the comments of the Deputies in that regard and I note them strongly.To secure the project for Ballinrobe, IDA Ireland was willing to purchase the freehold title to the building and sell it to the company at a substantial cost to the agency. In addition, IDA Ireland offered grant assistance based on a number of commercial factors and the limited planned capital investment by the company concerned. The IDA Ireland offer is high for the sort of project that has been proposed.IDA Ireland is doing well in locating and increasing the number of new greenfield jobs in the Border, midlands and west region. In 2002 44% of all new greenfield jobs were located in the BMW region compared with only 25% a few years ago.Regarding what Deputy Ring said about County Mayo, since 1997, the number of IDA supported companies and jobs in Mayo has increased from 17 with 2,624 employees to 25 with almost 3,500 employees at the end of last year.IDA Ireland's ability to do good deals for Ireland is beyond question. That is why I must question the wisdom of Deputies raising this matter as an issue for debate during negotiations.

They might have a sound point in that regard. However, the Department is strongly of the opinion that their tactics at this stage are wrong and it would rather the matter was left to negotiations between the company and IDA Ireland. It is to be hoped their efforts will be successful.

I thank the Minister of State and am delighted to know negotiations are still in progress.

Like many schools, it is run down. If the health and safety authorities were to visit, they would probably close it on the spot for failing on many grounds.The main problem is that it has no space in which to develop and be refurbished. Anyone who knows the area will know that the entrance to the school is close to a main road. The heating system does not function properly. The school cannot be refurbished because there are no alternative buildings in the area to which to transfer the school while refurbishment takes place. This is a fact recognised by the Department in that it allowed plans to be drawn up for the site in which I am asking the Minister to intervene. The school has no yard in which the children can play. They do not do PE because they have nowhere to go.For 40 years, there was a landlocked site next to the school, and no decision was made on it because the area was waiting for the Cork Street extension. The site lay idle. Cork Street has since reopened and the promised site is there for everyone to see. The problem is that it has a Dublin City Council "For Sale" sign on it. Despite all the promises over the years, the council has decided that because the Department of Education and Science has reneged on a promise to purchase the site, it will not wait around for the Department to make up its mind and has put the site up for sale. That is a regrettable decision by the council and I and other councillors and TDs who represent the area have urged the council to withdraw the "For Sale" sign.Will the Minister immediately take steps to negotiate with Dublin City Council to purchase this land at a reasonable price? No one suggests it should be given for free. In an ideal world, that is what we would seek, that State bodies would transfer the land between them.This area is one of major disadvantage and has suffered a great deal. It has the highest drug use in Europe among males between 17 and 25. What message would go out to young people in the area if the land they were promised for a new school was to be sold by the State?This matter is urgent. Dublin City Council is trying to sell this land because its tax designation expires in June. I have asked the council to delay the sale and allow the tax designation to lapse. This might encourage the Department to re-examine the purchase of the land and the building of a school appropriate to the modern world and the educational needs of the young people of an area that has suffered disadvantage, unemployment and poor educational standards. Will the Minister give a commitment, even at this late stage, to re-negotiate with Dublin City Council, purchase this site and, at the earliest opportunity, build a proper school on the site on Cork Street?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	746	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding acquisition of the site for St. Brigid's national school in the Coombe.As the Deputy is aware, the 2003 capital programme has been published and full details of individual projects are available on the Department's website. Section 9 of the programme sets out the estimated expenditure and site acquisitions for primary schools this year.On the basis of the budgetary allocation, it was not possible to provide for the acquisition of a site at St. Brigid's national school this year. The budgetary allocation for next year and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects, including site acquisitions which could not be included in this year's programme.In the meantime and subject to these funding constraints, the property management section of the Office of Public Works is exploring the possibility of acquiring the site adjoining St. Brigid's national school. The Deputy will appreciate that value for money for the taxpayer will be a key consideration for the Department of Education and Science in any discussions regarding the purchase of the site.I note what the Deputy said and thank him for giving me the opportunity of outlining the Department's position. Given what he said that the owner is the local authority and the disposal of sites is a reserved function for the council, and if what he says is correct that members of the city council across party lines would be united on this, obviously they would be able to handle the issue as they wish at city council level. I will relate what he said to the Minister but it is under consideration for next year.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	748	There seems to be agreement that Lissadell House should be acquired by the State or some combination of interests to ensure it comes into public ownership. I have not heard any objections to this. The efforts of the Gore-Booth family down the years, including the current owner, Sir Josslyn, to maintain the family home, Lissadell, is well known.I accept that now is not the best time as far as purchasing by the State is concerned. It would have been a much simpler task in the Celtic tiger era, but we have no choice. Lissadell is on the market, and unless the Government or the county council acts now in partnership and with the agreement of the people of Sligo, the opportunity will not arise again and the Gore-Booth collection will probably be scattered.There are excellent examples of the tourism value of large houses. The Ministers, Deputies Cullen and O'Donoghue and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who would be directly involved in any purchase, have some very good examples in their constituencies. In Connacht, a marvellous job was done on Turlough House in Castlebar. It is now the home of the national folk collection and a wonderful tourist attraction. Countess Markievicz was the most significant woman in Irish history and she is the only Member of Parliament whose portrait hangs in this national Parliament.Lissadell House or some of the excellent buildings on the estate would make a good centre for housing the national armada museum. This is bound to be developed at some stage following the discovery of three armada ships only a short distance along the coast from Lissadell. In recent times 47 canons were excavated on the shoreline. It is important that an archaeological survey is carried out into this as it would incorporate what would be a major attraction. It would be easy to imagine a well-designed combination of these two sites becoming a major tourist attraction, just the kind of attraction the region deserves and needs.Lissadell House remains an excellent example of early 19th century neo-classical architecture. It embodies much history of landlordism, good and bad. It was the family home of Countess Markievicz and William Butler Yeats was a regular visitor. Was there ever a better case for the State to intervene? Many people outside Sligo do not fully recognise the attraction of W. B. Yeats to Irish people and tourists. A great untapped potential exists. Lissadell House should be preserved. W. B. Yeats was inspired to write in one of his famous poems:The light of evening, Lissadell,Great windows open to the South.I am delighted to share time with Deputy Devins. I hope the Government will listen to this united front as it calls for the acquisition of this invaluable property.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	749	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of speaking on such an important issue. Lissadell House and its estate of 400 acres are currently on the public market. The Gore-Booth family has lived in Sligo for over 400 years and has been intimately bound up with the history, not only of Sligo but also of Ireland. It is an Anglo-Irish family of the ascendancy class yet it has produced one of the foremost republicans of our time, namely, Constance Gore-Booth. I do not need to remind the House of her enormous commitment to the cause of Irish freedom. This commitment has been recognised here by the placing of a statue in her memory in the grounds of Leinster House.Constance Gore-Booth and her sister, the well-known poet Eva Gore-Booth, were intimately connected with W. B. Yeats whose resting place, Drumcliffe graveyard, is only a few miles from Lissadell House. More than 100,000 visitors visit Yeats's grave each year. The development of a major tourist attraction, incorporating Lissadell House and estate, with Yeats's grave at Drumcliffe, would enable Sligo and the north-west to benefit from tourism to an extent that does not currently happen. The north-west does not have a major tourist facility.The opportunity for the State to purchase Lissadell House must not be lost. The House is architecturally unique. It has remained completely unaltered since it was built 160 years ago. It constitutes a once in a lifetime opportunity for the State to acquire a building, the like of which does not exist elsewhere in Ireland.All shades of political life in Sligo are fully supportive of this proposal. Sligo County Council will hold a special meeting next Tuesday to support the proposal and the county tourism board has already fully endorsed it. This issue transcends party politics. I ask that the Minister of State look favourably on the wishes of the people of the north-west and purchase Lissadell House and its estate for the people of Sligo and the region.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	750	I thank Deputies Perry and Devins for raising this matter and allowing me to outline the position of the Department. The Government is keenly aware of the importance of our architectural heritage and seeks to promote it through a variety of measures, including legislation, grants, tax incentives and State ownership of such properties. Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the basic legislation in this regard. It places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future.A number of support mechanisms for owners of protected structures are in place. The main source of public funds for heritage properties is through the Heritage Council and I understand that Lissadell House has received some grants from it. The local authorities also administer a scheme of grant aid for conservation works on protected structures. Funding of €2.888 million has been allocated to the scheme this year.The owner or occupier of a building which is determined by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. I am advised that the current owners of Lissadell House have benefited from the tax relief allowed under this provision.Each year, there are many demands from interested parties for the State to acquire property to ensure its best protection. However, with a substantial existing portfolio of 740 properties, it would be unrealistic to think that the State can continue adding to its heritage properties on an open-ended basis. The vast majority of heritage sites are in private ownership. It is neither feasible nor desirable for the State to acquire all heritage sites and, in general, protection will best be afforded through the existing planning and national monuments legislation.Turning to Lissadell House, it is considered to be of national importance and is so rated in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, not only because it is the family home of Countess Markievicz, but also because of its architecture, interior, setting and materials. Following requests that the State should acquire Lissadell House, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has asked his officials, in conjunction with Sligo County Council, to assess the property and to report back to him. Once he has a full report on the matter, covering issues such as the condition of the house, possible future uses, running costs etc., he will be in a position to make a considered judgment with regard to any future role for the State in managing the property.I will report to the Minister what the Deputies have said. I understand the inspection will take place shortly. There are two issues at play here of which buying it is only one. What is done with it thereafter and the issues of running costs and expenses etc. might be the bigger of the two problems in the long-term.

I believe that the Minister has sanctioned a further cut of 20% in the partnership's income. This has dealt a body blow to the organisation and has endangered the many outstanding employment, educational and community programmes successfully run by it since 1991.The general funding of partnership companies and other development bodies throughout the country has been cut by between 10% and 40%. As one of the 12 original partnerships in the most disadvantaged areas, the Northside Partnership has pioneered many outstanding programmes to assist unemployed and lower income families. At first the partnership concentrated on long-term unemployed and women returning to the workforce. The partnership needs additional funding, rather than these miserable cutbacks, to develop its work in its administrative area of the constituencies of Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central.A short time ago the partnership discovered that in addition to the cut of €80,000 at the start of the year, it would not be allowed to carry over funding. Its total loss of funding amounts to €435,775. I understand that when the organisation of partnerships met the Minister he did not seem to be aware that this was the case despite the decrease in funding for ADM from €48 million to €45 million. Under the current partnership development plan, the local employment service, which was invented by the Northside Partnership, is targeting four key groups for training and job placement. These are people with disabilities, people recovering from addiction problems, ex-offenders and Travellers, of whom there is a large community on the northside. As usual, the Northside Partnership has pioneered a wave of initiatives with regard to these four target groups, and should be commended and given further assistance rather than itself being threatened with redundancies. Two mediator positions are under threat among its core staff due to these harsh cutbacks.It was also the Northside Partnership that pioneered the challenger programme. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has been talking in the last few weeks about educational disadvantage. It was we on the northside who pioneered the effort to keep children in primary and second level schools; if they cannot be kept in first level they will certainly not make it to third level. The Minister's cutbacks have savaged this programme and made it impossible for us to carry on this work with many households throughout some of the most disadvantaged parts of the northside. I commend the chief executive of the Northside Partnership, Ms Marian Vickers, and our distinguished chairperson, Mr. Padraic White, the former head of the IDA. They have rightly been praised as the leaders of one of the best partnerships and local development projects in the country.A whole range of major developments across our region is now threatened by the failure of the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to sustain and support them. We had this discussion before about iar Chonnacht and Connemara, which I know well. I wonder whether, if this partnership was in the Minister's domain, it would have been savaged in such a manner. Is the Minister prepared to deal in an even-handed way with the disadvantaged areas of Dublin, which I believe is the Minister's native city? I strongly urge him to start taking his responsibilities as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs seriously and reverse these rotten cutbacks. I am not just talking about my partnership. I acknowledge that I have an interest in the Northside Partnership – I am a director – but equally important are all the other companies around the country, including in the Minister's own area of Galway.This disgraceful development is part of a Fianna Fáil con trick. Before the last election, the so-called RAPID programme was foisted upon my area. Some 27 actions were supposed to be taken to deter and deal with disadvantage in the most deprived areas of my constituency. Here we are, two and a half years later, with nothing achieved. All we hear about is process – meetings, meetings and more meetings. Nothing has been done. Deputy Ó Cuív is the Minister with responsibility for community affairs and I urge him to take action to restore the Northside Partnership's funding, and the funding of the other partnerships. He should do this, or get out.

I advise the Deputy always to think before he speaks. It is a good idea to do one's research. If he checks the record, he will see that the cutback in funding for Údarás na Gaeltachta was far greater, in percentage terms, than the cutbacks in the local development and social inclusion programme. That is a fact.

The difference is that Údarás na Gaeltachta has managed its finances in such a way that it can continue to carry out a full programme. I compliment it on this. I also compliment the work of the Northside Partnership. I had the privilege of visiting it last year and seeing what was being done.It is amazing that what the Labour Party proposes when it is in Government, it opposes when it is not.

It was the Labour Party that wanted all decisions made away from Government by independent bodies, but when those bodies make decisions that the Deputy does not like, he says that the Minister should step in and do what he cannot do, which is to make the decision.The facts of the matter are quite simple. An amount of €44.6 million has been provided in the Vote of my Department under the local development subhead, representing a 6% decrease compared to the amount provided in the 2002 Estimates. I emphasise to the Deputy that the cut was 6%. Just before Christmas last year, I gave money from savings in the Department to ADM to try to facilitate it. In 2001 and 2002, funding of €45.5 million and €47.6 million was provided to deliver the three sub-measures of the programme. The outturn of expenditure for both years was €43.2 million in 2001 and €53.6 million in 2002, because I made the decision before Christmas to give that money to ADM. This was done using savings under other subheads in my Department.The Northside Partnership was allocated a total of €3,618,753 from 2001 to 2003, which equates to an annualised amount of €1,206,251 in each of the three years. As a result of the reduced budget in 2003, the revised allocation for this year is €1,121,814 – a 7% reduction.

The Deputy was throwing figures around – 20%, 30%. We gave the money en bloc to ADM. I currently have no function in how that money is spent, although this is under review. ADM made the decision to spread the cuts evenly, according to the size of the group or partnership, right across the country. It delivers the programme on the ground for the 38 partnerships and 33 community groups. It agreed on how to allocate the money and each partnership group was notified. It could have done a number of things with this 6% cut. It could have decided to target the areas of greatest need for increased funding. This was a matter over which the Minister, fully in line with Labour Party thinking, has no control. What it decided to do, totally independently of me and quite likely without reference to me, because that is the way it is structured, was to institute across-the-board cuts of between 4% and 7%, depending on the annual budget of the partnership, with no reference to the activities of the partnership.I have gone over this time and again in the House, but I do not know where the idea came from among some community and area partnerships that underspends in one year could be carried forward and spent the following year.

The Deputy and I both know, as Members of this House, that an underspend in a Department returns to the Exchequer. It cannot be carried forward to the following year. As I have said again and again, we vote the Estimates through on an annual cash basis, not on an accrual basis. There is no way my Department could ever facilitate a cumulative carry-over. The validity of this is borne out by the fact that when the Estimates were announced at the end of November, ADM did not approach me regarding this matter because it understood the situation perfectly. It did not say that it had carry-over commitments. I only found out that somebody had a question about this when my local partnership in Galway rang me one Saturday about a month ago. I said that of course there was no question of a carry-over.I assure the Deputy that I am continuing to work with ADM. I have had fruitful meetings with the planners who have been more than helpful and have told me directly that they understand perfectly that the system operates as I have outlined. ADM is working closely with the area partnerships to minimise as far as possible the impact of the 6% reduction in funding this year. As regards the future, I assure the Deputy that we will have to live with the system of annual funding operated by the Oireachtas. Within that, I am committed to the areas of greatest deprivation. A concern I have had for many years has been that in widening the scope of the scheme to more areas—

Other speakers were given latitude earlier. In widening the scheme to more areas we inevitably reduce the amount of money available to each area. I assure the Deputy I am totally committed to the RAPID areas which are, by scientific analysis, the areas of greatest deprivation in this country. I am not satisfied with the structures I inherited and am setting about, following good Labour Party processes of consultation and negotiation, refocusing the schemes on the areas of greatest disadvantage. I assure the Deputy that by the time the next election comes around the people in those areas will be the first to defend my actions.The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 May 2003.

As a result, we will have less resources for new public spending. We are facing the prospect of having to borrow significantly in 2004 and again in 2005. Last December's budget projected that in 2004 and 2005 we would face large and continuing Exchequer borrowing requirements of €3.4 billion and €3.7 billion, respectively. As I stated in my budget speech last December, we therefore have no choice but to move our expenditure, pay and cost levels onto a lower growth trajectory.This year will see a significant moderation in the growth in public spending. I have also put in place new control mechanisms to ensure that public expenditure is carefully managed to take account of the new reality by being kept within target. It will also be necessary to ensure that the limited increased spending that will be affordable is allocated in a way that best meets the economic and social priorities of the country.

A wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy as well as all the submissions and representations which have been received by my Department, will be considered in the process of reaching a Government decision on the matter. Given these wide ranging considerations it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation.I wish to assure Deputy Deenihan that I am well aware of the case made for Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastle West and it will be given full consideration as part of the deliberative process.Deputy Penrose will appreciate, as I have already stated, that until the Government reach a decision on decentralisation, I am not in a position to say when the programme will begin or to state how long it will take to complete.

The commissioners control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy. The Act requires the commission to follow a strictly commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term subject to prudent risk management. In following this mandate, the commission has decided on a long-term asset allocation of 80% equities and 20% bonds.These features of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day to day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from the year 2025 until at least the year 2055, is to be achieved.

The anti-inflation initiative is part of this process and the Government agreed that proposals for action would be co-ordinated by a specially convened group.

Cumulative spending at end April was some €500 million less than that profiled by Departments at the beginning of the year. This trend in spending is primarily due to timing factors and does not indicate savings for the year as a whole. A breakdown of spending to end April by ministerial Vote group as compared to the profile is available for circulation to the House.Some spending pressures are emerging particularly in the larger spending Departments such as Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There are also some pay pressures emerging arising from the settlement of an outstanding equality case affecting some Civil Service clerical workers and the parallel benchmarking process in relation to craft workers, non-nursing and general operative grades. While it is the responsibility of each Minister to manage pressures in relation to his or her own Department, a mid-year review of the overall spending position is a normal feature of the management of aggregate public expenditure by the Government.The position in relation to taxation will be considered in the context of the emerging budgetary situation and tax changes, if any, will be announced as usual in the budget statement in December next.

For example, in the year 2002, the office completed 534 reviews, which represented an increase of 20% over the figure for the year 2001. The office has completed 198 cases in the first quarter of 2003, which represents an increase in output of 75% over the first quarter of 2002.There has, however, been a significant increase in review applications received in the first quarter of 2003. Applications are up 57% over the same period in 2002. Much of this increased volume can be accounted for by requests for records to the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children from former residents of industrial schools, special schools and other child care institutions.Decisions on these cases are being carefully monitored by the Departments concerned and their implications assessed. It is not clear, at this stage, whether the upsurge will persist, or the extent to which major projects to index and catalogue the records of those departments will improve the situation.

The success of our economy relies significantly on continued inward investment and on the performance of the export sector in selling goods and services to other countries.The continued global economic downturn, and the appreciation of the euro have been factors in the recent export performance. The strength of the euro has made Irish exports less competitive, particularly in the US and the UK markets.

Under the pact, Ireland is required to keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when there is actual or expected divergence from this objective. The budgetary situation in relation to both spending and revenue performance is kept under ongoing review, as is normal, in that regard.

The objective was to move from the old relativities – driven system which was characterised by leap-frogging claims often with no real basis other than that some other group had received an increase. The benchmarking process allowed a single assessment of the groups in the public service and there was agreement that historical cross-sectoral relativities were incompatible with this exercise. It also linked public service pay rates to similar jobs in the private sector.In the new national agreement Sustaining Progress the parties have agreed that benchmarking was an important initiative in developing a better system of public service pay determination and is an appropriate way to determine public service pay rates in the future.The benchmarking body recommended that the payment of the balance of the awards, that is excluding the payment of the first quarter from 1 December 2001, should be dependent on real and verifiable outputs from modernisation, flexibility and change. This was endorsed by the social partners in Sustaining Progress. It was further agreed that the payment of the general round increases as well as the final two phases of the benchmarking increases should be conditional on satisfactory implementation of the modernisation agenda and the maintenance of industrial relations stability.The agreement sets out the modernisation targets both generally for the public service and specific objectives for the major sectors. The aim of the modernisation programme is to ensure a better delivery of public services. The agreement sets out a verification process to be followed, including the preparation of and reporting on action plans, verification of progress by performance verification groups with a strong independent membership and final decisions by the relevant Secretaries General in each case that the necessary conditions have been met or not as the case may be.Under Sustaining Progress public servants are to receive standard round pay increase totalling 7% over the next 18 months and the implementation of the recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body. The total cost of these increases when fully implemented will be about €2 billion a year. This therefore involved the commitment of a very substantial part of the available resources in a very tight budgetary situation to public service pay.In deciding to make these amounts available for public service pay costs the Government was influenced in particular by two important considerations. These were the conditionality attaching to the pay increases in relation to public service modernisation and the commitments in the agreement to industrial relations peace and stability. All of the previous agreements contained industrial peace clauses but the provisions in Sustaining Progress were reinforced and underlined to a much greater extent than previously. Everyone involved knows that industrial relations stability is an essential requirement and must be delivered on. This is what the Government and the public sector unions signed up for.

The attention of the unit has been drawn to the call made at the recent conference of the Public Service Executive Union for improved procedures in this area.The Civil Service policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying, A Positive Working Environment, was introduced in July 2000 following an agreement between management and the Civil Service staff unions at General Council.Since 2000, most Departments have carried out formal investigations under the policy. As a result, significant additional demands have been placed on managers, personnel departments, investigators and on the Civil Service staff unions which have become increasingly involved in handling cases.The importance and sensitivity of the issue of bullying and harassment led the equality unit in my Department to carry out an informal review of the policy in 2002. The aim of the review was to ascertain whether the policy was working effectively and if problems were identified, to propose solutions.The review was based on discussions by the equality unit with personnel officers, investigators, the staff panel of the Civil Service General Council, which includes the Public Service Executive Union, and representatives of the employee assistance service. A document was drawn up which discusses the issues raised and makes proposals for amendments to the policy. The discussion document was circulated to these groups for comment in February 2003.

In relation to large capital programmes, therefore, spending authority for individual projects is generally delegated to the relevant spending Department.The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework in relation to the management of capital investment. In this regard, my Department has published guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector. The guidelines outline the steps to be followed in appraising capital expenditure proposals and managing capital projects across the public sector.The aim of the guidelines is to promote the most effective allocation and use of scarce resources across the public sector; improve the quality of information about capital expenditure proposals available to decision makers; ensure that public services provided are appropriate responses to public needs and are efficiently supplied; and encourage a systematic and consistent approach to the appraisal and management of public sector capital expenditure measures. The type and depth of appraisal depends on the size and nature of the project proposed.While the Department's guidelines set out overall principles, these are supplemented in many cases by spending Departments and agencies by more detailed instructions where large scale or complex projects are proposed. The detailed procedures adopted by Departments, therefore, may vary from the guidelines in line with the particular needs of the organisation concerned.

The most recent monthly figures available in respect of the scheme are the subscriptions to 31 March 2003. The monthly tax credit payout made in April 2003 was €44 million. It should be pointed out, however, that this is lower than the figures for January and February 2003 and the reduction is mainly due to adjustments made in respect of January 2003 claims by some financial institutions. On that basis, if the current average monthly payment for the first four months of 2003 continues for the full year, the annual cost in 2003 would be approximately €530 million. This is not a conclusive figure, however, and the final figure may be different than that if account holders change their monthly contributions.

Since budget day, the ECB has twice cut interest rates, and this, together with the appreciation of the euro and the decrease in oil prices, will have a favourable impact on the CPI this year.The annual rate of inflation fell to 4.3% in April. This was in line with the expectation that inflation would moderate over the course of this year. My Department's revised inflation forecast will be published as is customary in the economic review and outlook later in the summer.In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure of inflation is the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. The HICP inflation for Ireland for 2003 as a whole was forecast to be 4.2% on budget day. The Commission's spring forecast estimated that euro area inflation would average 2.1% this year.

The main recommendations in this regard were: first that the economic cycle should be taken into account when assessing compliance; second countries with deficits exceeding the close to balance or surplus requirement must improve their cyclically-adjusted budgetary position; third, member states should avoid pro-cyclical policies; and fourth, greater attention will be paid to analysing the long-term sustainability of public finances and greater emphasis will be placed on reducing debt levels and the quality of public finances.I have made clear on a number of occasions that I would support changes to the pact which would give greater recognition to member states with debt levels below the 60% reference rate especially where such member states have pressing needs for capital investment. This proposal was discussed by the relevant EU bodies but was not proceeded with at this time. The issue will be raised again at ministerial level and I will be setting out my views on the matter as appropriate.

Securing the competitiveness which has been so instrumental to our economic development, and thereby safeguarding jobs, is a key priority for this Government. Bringing our inflation rate down to that prevailing in our major trading partners as soon as possible is essential in this regard. The recent strengthening of the euro and its negative impact on our competitiveness has increased the urgency of this.That is why the Government made the commitment in Sustaining Progress to work together with the social partners to exert downward pressure on inflation. The anti-inflation initiative is part of this process and the Government agreed that proposals for action would be coordinated by a specially convened group.I look forward to the anti-inflation initiative group's report which is due produced by the end of the summer. I am confident that, working together in partnership, we will address the issue of domestic price pressures in the Irish economy to bring inflation down.In this context, the implementation of the moderate pay arrangements set out under Sustaining Progress is also vital.I am also of the view that keeping public expenditure on target will be important if our inflation rate is to moderate and I have put in place management and control mechanisms to this end.

The appreciation of the euro affects the economy in a number of different ways.The main negative effect of a stronger euro is to make Irish exports less competitive on world markets. This occurs as exports to non-euro areas become relatively more expensive, while at the same time imports from these areas become relatively less expensive. Also, firms competing with US and UK firms in third country markets will experience competitiveness problems. In addition, by diminishing the competitiveness of the euro area, it lessens demand for Irish goods and services in the euro area. As a significant proportion of Ireland's trade is with non-EU countries such as the UK and the US, this recent rise in the euro against sterling and the dollar must be a cause for concern.That is why competitiveness is a priority for this Government. We must remain vigilant to the risks to our competitiveness, such as wage and price inflation, otherwise jobs will be at risk.

The purpose of the review is to assess the extent of the flooding problem, clarify roles and responsibilities among the various State agencies involved in the issue of flood relief, and recommend practical action to deal with the problem more effectively in the future.The review group, which I chair, comprises of the Office of Public Works, Departments of Finance, Environment and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Agriculture and Food, the County and City Managers Association, IBEC, and the IFA. The first meeting of the group took place on 17 January 2003, following which an advertisement was placed in the three national daily newspapers inviting submissions from all interested individuals and bodies wishing to have their views considered by the review group. I am advised that 70 written submissions were received as part of this process and all of these are currently being examined.In addition, the review group also identified a number of key stakeholders whose inputs they believe are very important to the development of future policy and meetings with each of these bodies have been requested and in most cases now completed.To date the full group has met four times to consider a wide range of issues and I remain confident of being in a position to present its report to Government by late autumn of this year as originally projected.

To date, the Revenue Commissioners have collected €45.31 million in tax, interest and penalties as a result of the investigations. This is made up of €38.8 million, paid in 272 settled cases and €6.51 million in respect of payments on account, in cases still under investigation. I understand that 95 cases were finalised with no additional liability arising and that 85 cases are progressing towards finality. Of these, 15 involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve significant liability.Four cases are being dealt with in the Revenue Commissioners investigation and prosecutions division. Two of these cases are currently before the courts. Another case pleaded guilty and was fined in the District Court in Mullingar on 19 May. The remaining case is under ongoing investigation with a view to prosecution.

The Revenue Commissioners have at their disposal a significant body of enhanced audit and investigative powers, much of which was provided during my term of office as Minister for Finance. I also provided them with more than 400 additional staff in the last two years most of which have been deployed in the audit and compliance area.

For this reason, the Government has asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. Given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax and a reasonable period is being allowed for its effective introduction. The ESRI assessment referred to by the Deputy will be taken into account in this process and the use of any revenue raised will also be considered. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate at this early stage on what the outcome of this process may be.

It is agreed that one quarter of the benchmarking increases will become payable with effect from 1 December 2001, 50% of the increases will be payable from 1 January 2004 and 25% will be payable from 1 June 2005. It is expected that the first quarter will be paid in the next four to six weeks.The agreement also sets out the conditions applying to the payment of the increases, other than the first quarter, as recommended by the benchmarking body. Briefly, the payment of the increases is dependent on industrial relations stability, co-operation with change and flexibility and on achievement of a number of specific commitments in each sector. The adherence to these conditions and their timely achievement will be verified by a process set out in section 26 of the agreement. This should ensure that the payment of the increases will only be made on the basis of real and verified changes as recommended by the benchmarking body.

Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended by the Finance Act 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders will be the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001. This inquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001.Information that is being supplied by deposit takers on foot of High Court orders is becoming available on a phased basis. Very large volumes of information are being reported to the Revenue Commissioners under these High Court orders. Inquiry work in relation to the examination of the first batch of taxpayers commenced on 11 October 2002. Further issues of inquiry letters were made in January and May 2003. These three inquiry letter issues relate to 41,000 non-resident accounts that had 80,000 Irish addresses connected with them. Further inquiry letters will issue shortly.Apart from inquiries initiated on the basis of information reported under High Court orders, inquiries had also commenced in February 2002 into taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts which were detected in the course of the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions in 1999 and 2000 and did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.While it is clear that the Revenue Commissioners face a major programme of investigations over a number of years, they have informed me that they are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this, the final phase of the DIRT related investigations. Since 15 November 2001, the current phase of the investigation has resulted in payments of about €170 million to the Revenue Commissioners. This is in addition to the €227 million under the 15 November 2001 voluntary disclosure arrangements.

All owner-occupiers, including first time buyers, are generally exempt from stamp duty on new houses where the property is 125 square metres or less. In addition, there is more favourable stamp treatment for first-time buyers of second hand houses up to €381,000 as compared to other purchasers. First-time buyers in common with other owner-occupiers are also not subject to capital gains tax on the gain from the disposal of their main residence. First-time buyers also qualify for tax relief on mortgage interest payments and the Deputy will recall that in budget 2003, I increased the annual ceiling on mortgage interest payments by first time buyers which qualify for relief from €3,175-€6,350 – single-married or widowed – to €4,000-€8,000 – single-married or widowed. In addition, the period of time in which the higher amount of relief may be claimed was increased from five to seven years. First-time buyers who started to claim tax relief in respect of mortgage interest in the tax year 1998-99 or later stand to benefit from the new arrangements.The housing market is a complex and dynamic one and demands continuous monitoring and adjustments to address changing circumstances. In view of the record increases in housing completions in recent years, I consider that the tax incentives available at present for the purchase of residential property represent the optimal mix and are adequately balanced in the light of the current state of the housing market. Any proposals to alter this position will be considered as part of the normal review of existing reliefs in the context of the 2004 budget and Finance Bill cycle. In this context, I undertook in the Seanad debate on the Finance Bill 2003 to examine a proposal suggested to me whereby potential first time buyers would receive tax credits in respect of savings made within a special scheme solely for the purchase of their first home.

The national pensions reserve fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. They control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard to the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, and the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.In determining the investment policy of the fund during the drafting of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, I gave consideration as to whether this policy should be strictly commercial or whether it should be qualified by ethical, environment and other public policy criteria. A major difficulty in deciding on an ethical investment policy is where to draw the line, given that there will inevitably be different opinions and intense debate on what constitutes ethical and socially responsible investments. In short, there is unlikely to be broad consensus on any ethical investment policy. Furthermore, the list of what might be considered unacceptable investments is likely to continually change in the light of developments in the political, social and scientific spheres.

This circulated text did not refer specifically to legal advice and the question, as posed, may in fact misrepresent the Ombudsman's speech. The following is the relevant extract from the statement:I got a very strong feeling during my appearance before the committee that with one or two exceptions, even Deputies and Senators from the parties in Government began to recognise that they cannot properly fulfil their role as legislators unless they have some degree of independent and objective advice on particularly complex or technical Bills. Even if it were desirable, and I am not convinced that it is, it is unrealistic to expect that the two Houses will ever enjoy sufficient resources to "mark" the Government, so to speak. But it may be worth examining the possibility of some mechanism whereby Oireachtas committees would have available to them panels of unpaid experts whose experience and expertise would assist the Oireachtas in exercising what the Constitution refers to as "the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the state.The above aside, the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas has for some years had its own legal officer to whom legal questions relating to the responsibilities of committees or Members may be referred. I am also aware that the Houses of the Oireachtas has supplemented this from time to time by recourse to outside practitioners. Furthermore, all committees and sub-committees of inquiry formed by resolution of the Dáil have had made available to them significant legal and other expert advice.

Like an earlier 1997 study, I have placed a copy of this in the Oireachtas Library. Of the top 400 earners' cases examined in the 2002 study, 117 had an effective tax rate of less than 30%; 231 had an effective rate between 30% and 44% and 52 had an effective rate of 45% and higher. It is the case that, of the 117 earners that had an effective rate of less than 30%, 51 had an effective rate of less than 5% and 29 of those 51 top earners had an effective rate of 0%.However, this study indicates an increase in the effective tax rate of high earners in 1999-2000 compared with the findings of a similar study carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in 1997 on the effective tax rates of high earners in the tax years 1993-94 and 1994-95. One of the conclusions drawn from the 1997 study was that the use of capital allowances on buildings was one of the main methods of reducing the tax bills of high earners to very low levels. I subsequently capped the amount of capital allowances on buildings that could be set-off against non-rental income. Arising from this latest study I announced in budget 2003 the abolition of capital allowances for investment in registered holiday cottages and the reduction in capital allowances for hotels to the rate applying generally to industrial buildings. I also indicated that a range of reliefs would not be extended beyond their end-2004 termination date.While I support properly designed tax reliefs, the unintended use of the tax system by exploiting loopholes to reduce the tax paid by high earners is not my aim. Since taking up office as Minister for Finance, I have acted swiftly to address tax avoidance schemes that serve to narrow the tax base. Indeed, the 2003 Finance Act contains a series of such anti-avoidance measures.

The report provides useful information about the position of people with a disability working in the Civil Service and makes recommendations for practical steps which can be taken to make certain that the Government's policy operates effectively for the benefit of people with a disability.Discussions are under way between the equality unit in my Department and the Civil Service staff unions on the recommendations. The aim is to agree a new joint approach to the implementation of the target which would be put to the Government for approval. Agreement has been reached with the Civil Service staff unions on an outline approach to developing action plans to ensure the effective implementation of the policy.

I understand that they will be published by the Central Statistics Office later in the year.The most recent inflation data published by the CSO show that the annual rate of inflation in April, as measured by the consumer price index, CPI, was 4.3%, down from 4.9% in March. This was the sharpest decline in the annual rate since the start of 2001 and is in line with the general expectation that the rate of inflation will ease over the course of this year.

To date, the process has produced a number of properties deemed suitable for detailed assessment to determine their potential for disposal or redevelopment. In assessing these properties, a range of considerations are being taken into account, including: (i) the planning issues in the context of their development potential; (ii) their overall condition; (iii) the extent to which decisions on decentralisation might impact on them; (iv) the alternative uses to which they might be put, including the possibility of their being used for housing purposes; (v) their market value.The first of the properties to come on stream is Ladd Lane, Baggot Street, formerly a maintenance depot and stores for the building maintenance services of the Office of Public Works. Following the assessment process it has been decided to sell this property on the open market, at a time when market conditions are most favourable. It is expected that decisions concerning a number of other properties-sites will be announced over the coming months.

While there are legitimate commercial and other reasons individuals or companies hold assets offshore, it is clear that offshore locations have been used to conceal income, profits and gains which should have been subjected to tax in this State. Different types of assets, various world-wide locations and the secrecy which surrounds offshore activity mean it is not possible to identify the total value of assets held abroad by Irish residents or the level of tax evasion on such assets.Recent developments, both at EU and OECD level in the fields of taxation of savings and exchange of information are designed to enhance the availability of financial information for revenue authorities. In this context the Revenue Commissioners have initiated discussions with their counterparts in the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands for the negotiation of tax information exchange agreements. It is expected these developments will assist the work of Revenue's offshore assets group and impact on tax compliance generally.

This compares with a budget day target of 8% for the year as a whole. At end April 2003, the Revenue Commissioners net receipts were €104 million, 1.2% below profile. Public spending to end-April was within profile. The revised Estimates for public services, REV, published last February provided that net voted spending on services will be 6.7% more than provided in 2002. Year-on-year net voted expenditure to end-April was 8.2% higher than the same period in 2002. The Government is committed to achieving its expenditure targets and I have put in place management and control mechanisms to ensure this. As I said in my press statement of 2 April on the end-quarter Exchequer returns, there are some spending pressures emerging but it is up to each Department to manage within its 2003 allocations.

Two related reports which were commissioned by the Minister for Health and Children are now nearing completion, namely the audit of structures and functions in the health system and the national taskforce on medical staffing. I am considering the Brennan report in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. It is our intention to bring proposals in relation to this report and the two related reports to Government in the near future.

GNP measures the level of income accruing to Irish residents, including income generated by Irish companies operating abroad. Preliminary CSO estimates for 2002 show GDP growing at 6.3%, and GNP by 0.6%. Neither measure gives a complete picture of domestic economic activity in Ireland. For instance, GDP can overstate the level of economic activity in Ireland, where foreign multinationals' profits are concerned. In 2002, those profits were substantial. This investment has been instrumental in producing high rates of growth in the Irish economy in both GDP and GNP terms and thus high levels of job creation. On the other hand, the level of GNP can be lower than otherwise if profits earned by Irish companies operating abroad are less than expected. The gap between GDP and GNP is one indication of our success in attracting foreign direct investment to this country.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	817	The most recent economic forecasts published by my Department were those published on budget day. They included growth rates for 2003 of 3.5% for GDP and 2.2% for GNP. The forecasts were based on the assumption of a pick-up in the international economy in 2003. These budget day forecasts were made at a time when the international economic outlook – critical to the progress of a small open economy such as Ireland – was characterised by a high degree of uncertainty. The continued international slow-down is the most significant factor influencing the pace of domestic growth. Considerable uncertainty remains about the timing and pace of the global recovery. Preliminary CSO estimates for 2002 show GDP growing at 6.3%, and GNP by 0.6%. This indicates the economy entered 2003 with little momentum in GNP terms. The challenge, given the current circumstances, is to pursue the correct policies and, in particular, to safeguard Ireland's competitiveness to ensure that we will be well-placed to take advantage of the international recovery when it occurs. My Department will publish an updated forecast for economic growth in the Economic Review and Outlook which is usually available in August. It is not normal practice to publish any revised economic estimates until then.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	818	The original intention was that parliamentary inspectors could be appointed where an Oireachtas committee carrying out inquiries under certain statutory powers decided that it required such an officer to assist it. This was to be done by giving those inspectors a range of legal powers to compel citizens to give evidence on oath and to provide documents relevant to his or her inquiry.Since work on this issue began, Oireachtas committees conducting inquiries under compellability provisions have been successfully challenged in the courts. Steps are also being taken by the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform to establish committees of investigation in inquiries into matters of public concern. This carried a risk of both a parliamentary inspector at the behest of an Oireachtas committee and the committee of investigation deciding to investigate the same matters possibly at the same time. Not only would this be uneconomic but it could also result in divergent conclusions and generate conflict between the two authorities. It could also expose to undue stress a citizen who happened to be involved in both processes. In the light of these developments, I no longer believe that such legislation would fill a useful purpose.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	819	My Department has written to all Secretaries General and other heads of offices to ask them to put in place the necessary measures to ensure that the Civil Service change and modernisation agenda set out in Sustaining Progress can be delivered. Secretaries General who are responsible for particular sectors of the public service were also asked to ensure both that the stakeholders and agencies within their sectors were fully informed of the terms of the agreement and that they would actively participate in pushing forward the change and modernisation agenda. Arrangements have also been put in place by my Department to monitor developments in the modernisation commitments in Sustaining Progress across the public service. In addition, the strategic management initiative implementation group of Secretaries General has assumed a role of overseeing and driving progress towards achieving these commitments.A key element in ensuring that the commitments to modernisation will be achieved is the provision in Sustaining Progress that payment of the final two phases of the benchmarking increases and the general round increases is dependent, in the case of each sector, organisation and grade in the public service on verification of satisfactory achievement in relation to these commitments. This verification process will be carried out for each of the sectors of the public service by separate sectoral performance verification groups (PVGs). These groups will include independent members drawn from the private sector and customers of the relevant public sector. Each sectoral PVG will make an assessment of progress, at the latest, one month in advance of each of the payment dates specified in the agreement, apart from the first 25% of the increases recommended by the PSBB.I am satisfied that the verification arrangements set out in Sustaining Progress as well as the administrative arrangements I have outlined will prove to be adequate towards meeting the commitments on public service modernisation set out in that agreement.

Of these, five hold office on an ex officio basis. That left seven to be appointed by me. However, four of those seven persons must be from the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA). Of the four I appointed from the IFSRA board to the board of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, one was a woman. The other three discretionary posts were filled by persons who had served on the preceding Central Bank board. These persons had given valuable service on the previous board and it was important, from the point of view of continuity, to bring existing Central Bank board members into the new board structure. I am satisfied the structure now in place ensures an appropriate balance of interests, expertise and continuity of membership that copperfastens the strength and independence of the bank. However, it does not lend itself to sudden, radical alterations in the membership of the board at any one time.I am mindful of the Government's commitment to achieving a greater gender balance on the boards of State bodies and I have already undertaken to have regard to that factor as future vacancies arise on the board of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.

Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. The most recent information available is for April 2003. It should be noted that the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the Quarterly National Household Survey. The number of persons registered for unemployment assistance over the past two years, as requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table:

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	823	The amount spent by my Department in 2002 on advertising was €284,367.24. This includes €41,690 spent on public notice advertising in the media and in Iris Oifigiúl. This advertising was placed in the media by an advertising agency which was chosen following an open tender competition. As the Deputy will be aware, one of the main criteria in awarding Government contracts in an open tender process is cost and value for money. The remainder of the expenditure on advertising was, €242,677.24 which was in respect of the National Forum on Europe, which comes under the auspices of my Department. The bulk of this was for advertising in the national and provincial media and related to meetings of the forum around the country. This advertising was purely informational and served to inform the public of the forum meetings in their area, the aim of which is to promote and foster a greater understanding of the EU. My Department did not incur any costs in 2002 on outside public relations and marketing consultants.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	824	My Department spent a total of €185,692 on media advertising and public relations in 2002 and is committed to ensuring that expenditure in these areas is closely monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure value for money.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	825	In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000. The allocation of places to individual CE projects is an administrative matter for FÁS. FÁS prioritises CE projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality, and co-ordinates reductions in CE places to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of the programme. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. The net effect of what I have outlined is that projects outside of the priority groups outlined, may well be subject to a reduction in excess of 20% this year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	826	I am aware of the closure in question and I met representatives of the company and unions last February to discuss the situation. There is significant over capacity of ice cream production in Europe and this had already led to the closure of fifteen other company plants over the past eight years. The plant in Rathfarnham had been under review for a number of years. It remained unscathed following an earlier review but a review last year deemed it to be now too large to sustain the local ice cream market and too small, and not specialised enough, to be a competitive supplier to the European network. Over the next few weeks, FÁS will interview staff on site, as and when requested by the workers, to see what assistance can be provided to the workers including suitable training courses.In south Dublin, Enterprise Ireland is working closely with 316 grant assisted projects in helping them to increase their competitiveness and exports. Last year, Enterprise Ireland provided financial support to 61 projects in south County Dublin at a cost of €2.67 million. At the micro-enterprise level, the South Dublin County Enterprise Board has, since its inception, supported a significant number of projects in the area. As regards foreign direct investment, Wyeth Biopharma in Grangecastle, Clondalkin, has 500 highly skilled people already employed at its facility. This major investment will create 1,300 jobs by 2005. The Japanese pharmaceuticals project, Takeda Chemical Industries which announced its major investment in Ireland, has begun construction in Grangecastle, Clondalkin. This will be Takeda's first bulk pharmaceuticals plant to be constructed outside Japan. The plant will employ more than 60 people upon completion.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	827	An amount of €1,472,339 was expended by my Department, including the Defence Forces, on advertising and external public relations consultancies in 2002, over 90% of which was expended in connection with the ongoing Defence Forces recruitment campaigns. I am confident this expenditure represents good value for money. Expenditure in this area is monitored and the funding for advertisements and public relations consultancy services is €1,023,000 for the year 2003.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	828	Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the United Nations which has the primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN possesses no standing military forces of its own and relies on the provision of such resources by willing members. National sovereignty is a fundamental underlying principle of participation in the European security and defence policy. Participation in any specific operation by member states is decided on a case by case basis and in accordance with respective national decision making procedures. The provisions relating to participation of members of the Defence Forces in overseas missions are set out in the Defence (Amendment) Act 1960, as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, which provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State, as part of a particular international United Nations force. Participation in an overseas operation requires UN authorisation, a specific Government decision and, where the level of participation is to exceed 12 members of the Defence Forces, the approval of Dáil Éireann.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The Department spent approximately €2.8 billion in 2002 on the provision of a wide range of schemes and services to support the agriculture and food sectors. The total annual advertising budget amounts to just over €718,000 or 0.00025% of the total budget of the Department. The expenditure on advertising is the minimum necessary to ensure that the Department's clients and the general public are properly informed of the full range of the activities undertaken by the Department. The vast bulk of this spend covers the placing of statutory notices and general display advertising dealing with the Department's schemes and services. The Department does not have a budget for public relations or marketing activities.

Every effort is being made to fill the vacant post at the earliest date. The application will be processed as a matter of urgency once the vacancy has been filled.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	831	The rate of pension payable under the 1994 early retirement scheme is the maximum provided for by the EU council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments. My Department's proposals for the early retirement scheme that commenced on 27 November 2000, which forms part of the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000 to 2006, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set instead. My Department then proposed a rate that was the average of the scale initially proposed. This was acceptable to the Commission and is the rate provided for in the new scheme.A number of changes to the scheme that did not require formal Commission approval have already been implemented. An independent evaluation of the schemes that form part of the rural development plan is currently under way as part of the mid-term review process and will be submitted to the European Commission in due course.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	832	Listings of the charitable organisations that have benefited from beef products and from butter allocated under this scheme in 2002 and to date in 2003 follow. The level of support granted in respect of butter amounted to 20.1 tonnes for 2002 and 12.3 tonnes to date in 2003. No canned beef products were distributed under this scheme in 2002 as arrangements were made for a supplementary supply of the same products using beef from the special purchase scheme (SPS). The SPS stocks satisfied demand from charities during 2002 and were only exhausted in early 2003, at which stage distribution of the intervention stocks recommenced. The level of support granted in respect of beef to date in 2003 amounts to 116 tonnes of canned products.The criteria that apply in the assessment of applications for the scheme is that the organisation must be a reputable charity that provides aid to deprived persons. The Department maintains a list of these organisations and other eligible applicants are added to the list as appropriate as they apply. Certain practical conditions are applied to the schemes in operation in relation to such matters as record-keeping, inspection, and the suitability of facilities for collection, storage and distribution. Charities in receipt of canned intervention beef products to date in 2003:Ashbourne Meals on Wheels, 27 Castle Crescent, Ashbourne, County Meath.Balyna Parish Community Council, Balyna, Broadford, County Kildare.Bray Old Folks Association, Killarney Road, Bray, County Wicklow.Brother Stephen Russel House, Mulgrave Street, Limerick.Callan Voluntary Housing, Callan, County Kilkenny.Capuchin Day Centre, Bow Street, Dublin 7.Cheshire Community Services, Ballyfermot Community Civic Centre, Ballyfermot, Dublin 10.Christ the King Day Centre, 114 New Cabra Road, Dublin 7.Community & Renewal Enterprises, Parochial Hall, Gurranabrathar, County Cork.Community Centre, St Michael Street, Tipperary.Cuan Mhuire, Bruree, County Limerick.Dublin Food Bank, 35 Portland Row, Dublin 1.Garryglass Play/Holiday Scheme, Our Lady of Lourdes Community Action Centre, Rosbrien, Limerick.Gowran Conference St Vincent de Paul, Monteen More, Dungarven, County Kilkenny.Grantstown Day Care Centre, Wellington Bridge, County Wexford.Kilbrittan Welfare Group, Kilbrittan, County Cork.Kilkenny Social Services, Waterford Road, Kilkenny.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	833	In the past three years a total of 634,300 cattle have been exported. This comprises of 406,300 in 2000, 100,500 in 2001 and 127,500 in 2002. Our live exports are recovering well since the drop in exports in 2001 which arose primarily from the foot and mouth disease control restrictions imposed that year. Continued recovery is expected and is reflected in our live export performance to date this year which is very strong, and at some 73,000 is more than two and half times the level than the same period last year. Increased price competitiveness of Irish calves is reflected in these significantly higher levels of exports.Since the beginning of the year some 32,830 calves have been exported compared to 5,245 in the same period last year. Most of these went to the Netherlands and Spain. The Lebanon remains our main third country market for finished cattle.

Already this year some 32,800 calves have been exported, mainly to the Netherlands and Spain and a small number to Belgium. Exports of stores, weanlings and finished cattle so far this year amounted to 27,300, mainly to Northern Ireland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain. The Lebanon is our main third country market for finished cattle with close on 13,000 head exported to date this year.Our live exports are recovering well since the drop in exports in 2001 which arose primarily from the foot and mouth disease control restrictions imposed that year. A continuance of this recovery is expected and is reflected in our live export performance to date this year which is very strong, and at some 73,000 is more than two and half times better than the same period last year. Increased price competitiveness of Irish calves is reflected in these significantly higher levels of exports.

The details of the programme are as follows:1) The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002 is currently awaiting Committee Stage scheduling in the Dáil. I hope to progress this matter in the near future. 2) It is intended to publish the public service management (recruitment and appointments) Bill during the current Dáil session. The purpose of this Bill is to reform the recruitment and appointment process of the Civil Service and the posts currently within the remit of the Local Appointments Commissioners. This Bill was promised in Sustaining Progress.It is intended that three more Bills will be published during the autumn session, namely, the central bank and financial services authority of Ireland Bill, the ombudsman (amendment) Bill and the civil service regulation (Amendment) (1956 Act) Bill. 3) Work is continuing on the preparation of the following five Bills with an intended later date for publication: dormant accounts Bill, financial services (consolidation) Bill, member of council of europe development bank and asian development bank Bill, revenue Bill and the Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act 2001 (Amendment) Bill. 4) Annual Bills such as the Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill will continue to be published and enacted each year.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	836	As the Deputy will be aware, the issue of a fair and transparent arbitration mechanism to deal with developing country debt has arisen recently either as a stand alone mechanism or as part of suggested mechanisms for restructuring debt. While not wishing to prejudge the outcome of such considerations, which are ongoing, I am aware of a number of difficulties with current suggestions. This is hardly surprising given the scale of what is proposed. At the very least, there are bound to be difficulties in seeking to modify current debt arrangements and maintain the flow of foreign investments to developing countries. To make such a proposal operational there would need to be a quite unprecedented degree of consensus between national governments, creditor and debtor nations, in particular the private sector bond holders and the international financial institutions. Furthermore, unless such a mechanism were to be very carefully designed there would be real risks to areas such as national sovereignty which might render the approach wholly unacceptable to the debtor countries concerned. It could also threaten to jeopardise the flow of new borrowing which is particularly vital to the development of HIPC countries. I am encouraged to see that these issues have begun to be explored.In addition, other measures, such as the use of collective action clauses which facilitate debt restructuring may be useful. These clauses provide for the orderly resolution of disputes concerning repayments, should such difficulties arise, and thus contribute to a more stable international financial order. It is the declared intention of EU states to use these contractual provisions when issuing bonds under a foreign jurisdiction.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	837	I share IBEC's concern as regards the relatively high rate of inflation in Ireland. However, the inflation rate is falling. The most recent CSO data show that the rate of inflation in Ireland in April, as measured by the CPI was 4.3% which represented the sharpest decline in the annual rate of inflation since January 2001. Strong services sector inflation has been the driving force behind Irish inflation. There are signs, however, that services sector inflation is beginning to moderate. In April, for instance, annual services sector inflation was 5.5%, compared to 6.2% in March and around 8% in the first half of 2002. Bringing our rate of inflation down towards that of our EU partners is a priority for the Government. This must be done to safeguard our competitiveness and avoid losing jobs. That is why the Government made the commitment in Sustaining Progress to work together with the social partners to exert downward pressure on inflation.

After consideration of this report and discussions with the IFA, I asked the Office of Public Works to carry out a pre-feasibility study into possible flood relief measures on the River Shannon. This process is currently under way. The report will take approximately nine to ten months to complete and will involve consultation with affected land owners and other interested parties.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	839	A wide range of important issues must be considered in the process of reaching a Government decision on decentralisation. That decision has not yet been taken and before it is taken it is vital that all concerned are fully consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental management concerned about the delivery of public services. While the deliberative process is ongoing, it would not be appropriate to second guess the outcome of the Government decision and therefore, it would be premature and inappropriate to identify a particular location, or a Department or office, or a section within a Department or office or numbers of staff which might be selected for inclusion in the new programme of decentralisation.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	841	As stated in the published code of practice for the governance of State bodies, and as reiterated in the report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee (2002) the Government expects commercial State companies to have a dividend policy which has as its objective the payment of a full commercial dividend to its shareholder. The payment of a dividend by Aer Rianta is to be seen in this context. Dividends from State companies are paid into the central fund as Exchequer extra receipts. They are accordingly used to fund Exchequer spending generally, rather than earmarked for any particular sector. The development of aviation infrastructure in the State-owned airports is the responsibility of Aer Rianta and is financed by its airport charges and other income.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	842	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer made a claim for the one-parent family tax credit in March 2002. A taxpayer who is a single parent, and who is not living with another person as man or wife, may claim the one-parent family tax credit for a qualifying child. The child must reside with the claimant for the whole or part of the year of the claim.The inspector of taxes wrote to the taxpayer in March 2002 and again in July 2002 requesting the information required to process his claim – his P60 forms and confirmation that the taxpayer had not lived with another person as man or wife during the periods to which his claim relates. The inspector has no record of having received a reply. When the inspector receives the required information, the taxpayer's claim will be processed as quickly as possible.

The most important requirement for the relief is that the person with a disability meets the medical criteria specified in the regulations and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer who is an official of the local health board. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the administration of the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, that they have no record of an application from the person concerned and I have arranged for issue of information booklet VRT 7 which sets out in detail the requirements for admission to the scheme, together with the appropriate application form.I recommend that the person concerned should, as a first step, contact the local senior area medical officer with a view to obtaining the required certificate, if he or she has not already done so. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for the relief without the issue of a primary medical certificate. If the person concerned requires further information with regard to the scheme they should contact: The disabled drivers section, Customs and Excise, Coolshannagh, Monaghan, phone (047) 82800, which will be glad to be of assistance.

The CSO estimates that growth last year was 6.3% in real GDP terms, and 0.6% in real GNP terms. The main implication of these developments is that the economy will have entered 2003 with little momentum. There is still considerable uncertainty about the timing of a global recovery. The risks to the budget day forecasts of GDP of 3.5% and GNP of 2.2% are therefore on the downside. It is essential that we maintain our competitiveness if we are to avoid losing jobs. In this context the implementation of the moderate pay increases agreed under Sustaining Progress is important. Also important is the anti-inflation initiative. Under this initiative, the Government, together with IBEC and ICTU, will work to keep downward pressure on the domestic sources of inflation.I am confident that if we adopt the correct policies and secure our competitiveness we will be well placed to benefit from the economic recovery when it comes.

In order to qualify for relief under the scheme, an applicant – disabled driver or passenger – must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the relevant health board. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. There are six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: (a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; (b) persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; (c) persons without both hands or without both arms; (d) persons without one or both legs; (e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; (f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.I have no function in the determination of whether a person meets the strict medical criteria to qualify for the various concessions under the scheme. However, the scheme has been reviewed by an interdepartmental group. Its report is currently being considered and any proposals in this report regarding the medical criteria and other conditions of the scheme will receive full consideration. There are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.

The reformed taxation system will continue to attract the inward investment which has proved so vital to our economic growth. Our work force is highly skilled and we are continuing to invest significantly in our education system to ensure that this remains the case. Infrastructural development also continues to be prioritised. Securing the competitiveness which has been so instrumental to our economic development, and thereby safeguarding jobs, is of key importance for this Government.Bringing our inflation rate down to that prevailing in our major trading partners as soon as possible is essential in this regard. The recent strengthening of the euro and its negative impact on our competitiveness has increased the urgency of this. That is why the Government made the commitment in Sustaining Progress to work together with the social partners to exert downward pressure on inflation. The anti-inflation initiative is part of this process and the Government agreed that proposals for action would be co-ordinated by a specially convened group. I look forward to the anti-inflation initiative group's report which is due by the end of the summer. I am confident that, working together in partnership, we will address the issue of domestic price pressures in the Irish economy to bring inflation down. In this context, the implementation of the moderate pay arrangements set out under Sustaining Progress is also vital. Keeping public expenditure on target will be important if our inflation rate is to moderate and I have put in place management and control mechanisms to this end.

Even allowing for the fact that GDP overstates domestic activity in Ireland, this is still a strong indication that Ireland's economy outperformed the EU-15 average in 2002. Looking at this year as a whole, the Commission has forecast that real GDP growth in Ireland will be 3.3%, which is ahead of its forecast for real EU-15 growth of 1.3%.

However, I am aware that the rate of inflation is a cause of concern to the business community and I share that concern. Bringing the rate of inflation down towards that of our EU partners is a priority for the Government. This must be done in order to safeguard our competitiveness and avoid losing jobs.

According to the most recent CSO data, inflation fell to 4.3% in April, which represents the greatest fall in the annual rate since early 2001. Services sector inflation is also moderating. The challenge now is to ensure that we bring inflation down as quickly as we can.

As a result the economy will have entered 2003 with little momentum. On budget day my Department's forecast for real GDP growth for this year was 3.5%, and 2.2% for real GNP growth. Considerable uncertainty remains about the timing of a global recovery, therefore the risks to my Department's economic projections for this year are on the downside.Currently, only a limited amount of data for economic indicators is available for this year. For most indicators we have less than two months of preliminary data available. However, at this point tax revenue performance and sentiment surveys indicate that the economy has yet to experience an upturn. CPI data, of which four months data is available, is moving downwards, with the April figure of 4.3% showing the sharpest fall in the annual rate of inflation since January 2001. The CSO will publish its finalised data for the first quarter of 2003 in July and for the second quarter of 2003 in October.

This small increase is due to technical factors rather than increased borrowing – Ireland ran an Exchequer surplus of €95 million in 2002.A slightly wider measure of debt, which includes the debt of the local government sector and non-commercial State bodies, is the general Government debt. The general Government debt-GDP ratio is the measure generally used for purposes of international comparison. Ireland's general Government debt-GDP ratio stood at 34% at end 2002 and it is projected to remain at this level at end 2003. This is the second lowest debt-GDP ratio in the EU.

The Embassy of Ireland in Tel Aviv together with the embassies of other EU member states is in regular contact with the Israeli authorities in relation to the safety of Irish, EU and other foreign citizens in the occupied territories.The safety of Irish citizens is of primary concern to my Department. The embassy in Tel Aviv, together with the representative office in Ramallah, continually monitor the situation and have made representations to the Israeli authorities in a number of cases concerning the safety and right of access of Irish nationals.Bearing in mind the security situation in the territories, my Department continues to advise against all non-essential travel to the West Bank and Gaza, and Irish citizens there are advised to leave. Irish citizens intending to travel to Israel or the occupied territories are strongly recommended to register with the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv.

There are very limited circumstances in which the Department of Foreign Affairs may refuse to grant a passport, primarily: where an Irish court order expressly and specifically prohibits the issuance of a passport to a particular citizen, including where a person has been released by the courts on condition that he or she does not leave the jurisdiction; where the Department's records show that a person has fraudulently claimed Irish citizenship, has fraudulently acquired or misused an Irish passport or has a history of losing Irish passports; and in the case of minors, where explicit written witnessed consent by parents or legal guardians is not produced.A passport would generally not be issued to a person while he or she is in prison. However, upon release, an ex-prisoner would be free to seek and be granted a passport unless there is some circumstance as outlined above which would disbar this.

The Government is deeply concerned about the situation there: the loss of life on a scale almost too awful to comprehend; the human rights and humanitarian situation, particularly in the troubled province of Ituri, but also in other parts of the east including North and South Kivu. Appalling atrocities have been carried out as premeditated weapons of war. There has often been a strong ethnic component to the atrocities. Very often, the scramble for control of the natural resources of the region has driven the violence, chaos and murder.

Any such action, as a practical matter, would have undesirable consequences, such as undercutting as far as Israel is concerned, the role which the European Union has in the peace process, blocking Palestinian trade with the European Union and rendering the continuation of our programmes of assistance to the Palestinian Authority and people more difficult to implement.Article 2 of the association agreement reinforces obligations which already fall to the signatories with respect to human rights. The European Union, especially at the meetings of the association councils with Israel, has conveyed its concerns to the Israeli authorities at the human rights implications of its security policies. Together with our partners in the Union, we will continue to take these opportunities to press the Israeli Government to respect fully its obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the fourth Geneva Convention, and under article 2 of the association agreement.I am aware that human rights organisations have expressed the concerns to which the Deputy refers. My Department has regular contacts with many non-governmental organisations concerned with human rights, political and development issues in the Palestinian Territories.

It was presented to the parties on 30 April and has now been accepted by both the Palestinian and Israeli Cabinets as the basis for a settlement. The presentation of the road map was marked by a statement of the current Greek Presidency of the European Union, which welcomed the development and reiterated the well known position of the Union. The road map and its implementation have been the subject of discussions by European Union Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 May. The Council adopted conclusions reaffirming the commitment of the Union to the peace process and the implementation of the road map. The road map was also discussed at the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Euro-Mediterranean States in the framework of the Barcelona process, which took place in Crete earlier this week. Israeli and Palestinian Ministers attended this conference and were made aware of our expectations for progress on the road map.

The restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities have recently been raised with Israeli representatives by the Presidency of the European Union in both Athens and Jerusalem and by the European Commission in Brussels. I understand that the measures will be reviewed by the Israeli authorities in the next few days and I am hopeful that they will be lifted. Israel has legitimate security interests, of which we are conscious. However, it also has obligations to the population of the occupied Palestinian territories under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Any security measures necessary must be proportionate and take due account of the needs of the people of the territories and Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law.

The Union has made representations at various times to both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority on the subject of human rights abuses in the territories. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 May the Council conclusions stated:The Council recognised Israel's legitimate security concerns. It is, however, deeply preoccupied by the number of Palestinian civilian deaths and called on Israel to act within the constraints of international law, and not to impede access to humanitarian groups.

I have articulated the Government's view on the matter on a number of occasions, including our views on the involvement of neighbouring countries in the conflict.We maintain a critical dialogue with the Ugandan Government and raise on an ongoing basis a range of issues which are of concern to us. In particular, we have taken serious issue with Uganda's involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We have made clear repeatedly to the Ugandan authorities our view that the full implementation of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement by all parties to the conflict offers the most viable solution to that conflict.Along with our partners in the European Union, we have issued a démarche to the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda about the situation in Ituri, expressing grave concern about the continuing violation of human rights which are being perpetrated by many armed groups in the province, and calling on the countries concerned to use their influence to reduce tensions in the region.

I joined with my Council colleagues in expressing publicly our continued alarm at the ongoing illegal settlement activities and land confiscations for the construction of the so called security fence which threaten to render the two state solution physically impossible.Any attempt by Israeli occupation authorities to appropriate land in the West Bank or Gaza is illegal and contrary to international law. This includes the appropriation of land for the so-called security fence. I would not accept that such a fence would best serve Israel's long-term security.

Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction under the capital programme for 2003, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position during this year to allow the project to progress beyond its current authorised stage. The timing of when the project will be authorised to progress is dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years.

It is a matter for the employing school authority to determine, within the guidelines laid down by my Department, whether or not an applicant for a teaching post is adequately qualified for the position as advertised. In the case of vocational education committees and the boards of management of community and comprehensive schools, the guidelines provide that, should the school authority consider an applicant's qualifications to be outside of the guidelines but nonetheless suitable for an advertised post, the school may refer the qualification to my Department for assessment of its suitability for the proposed appointment. If the Deputy provides me with full details of the particular case to which she is referring, I will arrange to have the matter examined as expeditiously as possible.

My Department, however, continues to work with Waterford Institute of Technology in developing and upgrading the institute. In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional Technical College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south east region. The committee's report also recommended an increase in student places, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. It was recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation rate in degree programmes.

Exchequer funding of €208,476.74 was provided in 2002 for works at the pier. There is no Exchequer funding available in 2003 for this project. The question of funding these works in 2004-06 will be considered in the context of the funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.

The findings of the latest Forfás consumer pricing report are undoubtedly a cause of concern for the Irish tourism sector generally and serve to reinforce worries that I have consistently expressed since taking office. It is critical that our tourism product remains competitive in international terms and the likelihood that Ireland is to become the most expensive country in the eurozone during 2003 represents a serious threat to our prospects of recovering from the setbacks of the last couple of years.

However, my Department and I have regular contacts and consultations with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, which represents the interests of key tourist industry groups including the Farm Holidays Association. I also understand the association was one of several key representative groups that met bilaterally with the Tourism Policy Review Group and that a useful and informative exchange of views took place in relation to the future development of the sector.There are no funds at the disposal of my Department under which grants can be made available to investors in this sector, although I understand they benefit from marketing supports provided by Fáilte Ireland.

Given the significant external shocks impacting on the tourism and travel sector globally and the absence of official statistics for the year to date, it is not possible, at this stage, to give a projection of visitor numbers for 2003. I understand there is evidence of a recovery in bookings following a slump in some key markets and Tourism Ireland Limited is still hopeful, rather than confident, of achieving its 5% growth target. In 2002, an estimated 13% of all overseas visitors came to Ireland specifically to participate in an activity or pastime, or to attend a cultural event or festival and a similar overall performance could be expected in 2003.
Question No. 191 answered with Question No. 186.

Achieving that goal has long been recognised, both in Ireland and elsewhere, as a major challenge.One of the key targets under the tourism marketing measure of the productive sector operational programme is a 2% shift away from peak season over the period of the national development plan. Results suggest that there has been a shift of 1% over the first two years of operation of the measure. That represents a significant achievement. Seasonality concerns will continue to influence our international tourism marketing campaigns which are delivered via Tourism Ireland Limited.Today marks the establishment of our new National Tourism Development Authority to be known as Fáilte Ireland. Fáilte Ireland will work with the industry to help achieve a wider seasonal and regional distribution of tourism business.

Proposals as to how the national conference centre project might best be progressed are being finalised by my Department.

However, it remains my intention to bring the matter to Government as soon as possible.

Currency fluctuations are a commercial reality for the tourism industry and for this reason I understand that many tour operators and travel agents take the necessary hedging precautions to mitigate against unfavourable currency movements. In this context, I am informed that the prices of holiday packages on offer to US tourists this year would already include an element of built-in protection against a weakening dollar. For this reason, Tourism Ireland does not envisage a significant impact on US visitor numbers in 2003 arising directly from currency variations.

Action on significant lifestyle factors which influence these major public issues has been recognised by successive administrations as requiring attention and I am sure the Deputy will agree that health promotion measures form an important element in tackling these diseases and in improving public health.The health strategy, Quality and Fairness A Health Systems for you, sets out detailed plans for further action in the prevention of disease and injury and the promotion of healthier living.Approximately 4% of overall expenditure under the general heading of public relations, marketing and advertising in 2002 related to the cost of personnel employed in the Department's press office which serves an essential function in providing information to the press and to the general public.

The service plan approved the transfer of funding from domiciliary home care services to support this priority development. The home birth scheme was suspended by the Western Health Board on this basis. The current caseload of patients who have booked for home births will have their service completed by the end of September 2003 and no further patients are being accepted.I understand that the board is awaiting completion of an internal evaluation of the project by the steering committee. The impact and future organisation of the domino service and the provision of midwifery led services is being examined by management and clinical staff at UCHG.The home birth pilot projects have their origin in the report of the maternity and infant care scheme review group which was published in 1994. Following the publication of this report, the chief executive officers of the health boards established an expert group to consider approaches to providing a home birth service as suggested by the review group.The expert group recommended the following three pilot projects which were subsequently established and funded by my Department: a community midwifery service, to be conducted in Cork by the Southern Health Board; a hospital outreach approach to be conducted by the Western Health Board and based at the University College Hospital, Galway; and a domino-outreach project, domiciliary care in and out of hospital based at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.At the request of my Department, the chief executive officers' group has established a domiciliary births group with the following terms of reference: prepare an up to date progress report on the implementation of the recommendations from the expert group on domiciliary births – 1997; make recommendations on the long-term approach, arising from the outcome of the pilot schemes; and establish protocols and procedures; to commission an external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects.

This is leading in turn to increased alcohol-related harm among young people. A policy response is called for and I intend to address some of the issues arising in this area in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003, the general scheme of which the Government approved at its meeting yesterday, 27 May.The purpose of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 will be to amend the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2000 in order to respond to certain recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and to concerns outlined in the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol. Also relevant in this context is the special initiative on tackling alcohol misuse set out in chapter 2 of Sustaining Progress, the Social Partnership Agreement 2003 – 05.The Bill will contain a number of provisions designed to combat under-age and excessive consumption of alcohol. For example, it is intended to strengthen existing provisions relating to the supply of intoxicating liquor to under 18s. Consumption of intoxicating liquor by a person under 18 will only be permitted in a private residence where a parent or guardian has given explicit consent. The Bill will also provide that persons under 21 must carry an evidence of age document on licensed premises. Sanctions and penalties will be increased and in order to improve compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws, the Bill will contain a provision extending enforcement powers to non-uniformed gardaí.The Bill will also contain a number of provisions relating to persons under 18 years. It is proposed to safeguard the existing discretion of licensees to exclude children under 15s from bars of licensed premises at any time but in future children will not be allowed in the bars of licensed premises after 8 p.m. Moreover, licensees will be permitted to exclude children wherever it appears that the duration of a child's presence in the bar could reasonably be regarded as injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the child. Licensees will also be given discretion to exclude young persons aged 15 to 17 from the bars of licensed premises at any time, but they must be excluded after 8 p.m.I propose to amend the Equal Status Act 2000 in order to permit licensees to set a minimum age for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor at a level above the statutory minimum of 18 provided the policy is publicly displayed and operated in a non-discriminatory manner.

The cost of retaining a communications firm to provide advice and assistance on a range of interactions between my Department and the public and media was €47,192 in 2002. There was no expenditure in relation to marketing.I am satisfied that the expenditure overall represents best possible use of resources.

It is not proposed to review the basis on which the scheme was terminated or to reintroduce the grant.Regulations setting out the circumstances on which new house grants would be paid after 14 November 2002 came into force on the day of the announcement. My Department published an advertisement in the national press on 15 November 2002 setting out the conditions for new house grant payment as stipulated in the regulations. A further reminder was published in the press on Friday 29 November 2002. Both press advertisements clearly stated that the closing date for receipt of applications was 4 December 2002.Some 13,827 new house grant applications were received in the housing grants section of my Department in the three week period between 15 November 2002 and 4 December 2003. Some 337 applications have been received since the closing date for receipt of applications. As these applications do not respect the well publicised deadline, they cannot be admitted and it would not be appropriate to investigate their details further.

This includes €41,690 spent on public notice advertising in the media and in Iris Oifigiúl. This advertising was placed in the media by an advertising agency who were chosen following an open tender competition. As the Deputy will be aware, one of the main criteria in awarding Government contracts in an open tender process is cost and value for money.The remainder of the expenditure on advertising was, €242,677.24 which was in respect of the National Forum on Europe, which comes under the auspices of my Department. The bulk of this was for advertising in the national and provincial media and related to meetings of the forum around the country. This advertising was purely informational and served to inform the public of the forum meetings in their area, the aim of which is to promote and foster a greater understanding of the European Union. My Department did not incur any costs in 2002 on outside public relations and marketing consultants.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	925	The use of advertising is essential in ensuring that all of our citizens are fully aware of their social welfare entitlements and are notified about improvements and changes affecting their payments and services. The amount of advertising expenditure in any one year is determined by the number of specific advertising campaigns which are undertaken.My Department's expenditure on public relations consultancy in 2002 was €6,534. Expenditure on advertising in 2002 was €1,319,239, of which €981,960 was in respect of the print media and €337,279 in respect of the broadcast media. There was no expenditure on marketing in 2002.Expenditure on advertising covered a wide range of departmental schemes and services and included three information campaigns relating to the promotion of the farm assist scheme among low income farmers; the promotion of awareness of the personal public service number and its use as the key to accessing integrated public services and e-government; and the budget 2003 information campaign which advised social welfare customers on when and how their budget increases would be paid.I am satisfied that the expenditure on advertising in 2002 served to promote awareness and understanding of our schemes and services and provided excellent value for money. It is expected that expenditure on advertising in 2003 will be €520,000.

The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. In addition to a basic allowance, supplements may be given to assist with various needs, including rent, mortgage interest, dietary requirements and heating. Payments are also made in cases of exceptional and urgent needs where, in the opinion of the health board, the circumstances of a case so warrant. The number of recipients of basic supplementary welfare allowance and supplements for each of the past two years is as shown in the following tabular statement. The tables also provide details of unemployment assistance cases which were pending appeal. The figures relate to the position at the end of December in each case.Recipient numbers of basic SWA and supplements at end of 2001

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	929	The respite care grant is paid to carers who are in receipt of a carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is not payable with other social welfare payments. However, a person with an entitlement to more than one social welfare payment will always receive the payment most beneficial to him-her. The person concerned is in receipt of a retirement pension at the maximum rate of €157.30 per week. He also receives a fuel allowance of €12.90 per week during the fuel season and is in receipt of the other free schemes. Overall he is therefore in a financially better position than if he were in receipt of carer's allowance including the respite care grant. All other matters relating to the provision and availability of respite care generally are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.

The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department, provides for exceptional needs payments to be made to assist with essential, once-off expenditure. Expenditure of the kind referred to in the question would not be regarded as appropriate for funding under the scheme.
