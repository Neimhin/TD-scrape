            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Darren O'Rourke</b> asked the <b>Minister for Transport</b> if his attention has been drawn to the funding shortfall at Meath Local Link, which has led to school bus transport from Ratoath to Navan being cancelled; and his plans to address the matter. [25882/20]</p>

          <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">Children in Skreen have attended school in Navan for generations and they have been accommodated under the school transport scheme for years. Similar to many others around the country, they found their own solutions when they were left out of that scheme, such is its exclusionary nature. Families managed to work with Flexibus and TFI Local Link Louth, Meath, Fingal to get a bus on the road and share the cost. When the 50% rule was introduced with three days' notice, they were told that the National Transport Authority, NTA, does not handle school transport. How will the Minister intervene to facilitate these 33 children?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Eamon Ryan)<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport. The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally. The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport including management of the rural transport programme, which now operates under the Local Link brand. The school transport scheme comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, and is managed by Bus Éireann on her behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> My Department provides aggregate funding for Local Link services to the NTA, which, in turn, allocates the funding to the individual transport co-ordination units, TCUs, nationwide, also known as Local Link offices. The TCUs manage the day-to-day requests for and delivery of public transport services. TFI Local Link Louth, Meath, Fingal, that is, Flexibus, operates and delivers rural public transport services on behalf of the NTA in counties Louth and Meath and the Fingal area in north County Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> The NTA has advised that Covid-19-related social distancing requirements have increased the costs on the existing service provided by Flexibus, about which the Deputy has inquired. As such, the company was not in a position to continue providing the service as previously without additional support or grant aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> Under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the definition of a "public bus passenger service" excludes the NTA from licensing or providing services for carrying children to or from school. Consequently, the NTA does not manage the delivery of dedicated school transport services. </p>
            <p eId="para_7"> Local Link services are for mainstream public transport services open to all. Dedicated school transport services continue to be funded by the Department of Education and Skills and operated by Bus Éireann, largely via a network of subcontractors. As such, the NTA has advised that it is not in a position to allocate resources to Flexibus for a school-specific service such as the one referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">The Government tells us all eligible children will be accommodated. That is a careful use of words, which hides the fact that thousands of children who would have been accommodated in previous years have been excluded from school transport scheme this year. Covid-19 is a factor, but the Government's complete failure to plan, prepare and deliver is a larger one. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, was consulted but the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, was not. That tells us everything we need to know.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> This case is particular but it is not unique. The families tried to fund the service themselves this year. The bus company needed €50 per child per week, €80 for two children and €120 for three children. That was a significant expense, which families simply could not meet. It has caused chaos, turning daily schedules on their heads, cramming kids into cars and putting more cars on the road. Will the Minister instruct the NTA and Flexibus to reinstate funding for the service or will he intervene with the Minister for Education and Skills and Bus Éireann?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">The Deputy is correct that this is not the only example. It is a cruel and critical problem for every family affected. If I recall correctly, 20,000 students throughout the country are on bus services not provided by the Department of Education and Skills. Many of these services are in particular difficulty because of the 50% rule concerning capacity of bus services. The local Flexibus service is a brilliant company, but there is a clear difference between an operation of that type and a bus service run exclusively for a school and its students. That cannot be funded by the NTA. By definition, Local Link services are open to all and are not school specific. If we changed the rules in this location, we would have to change them for the entire country, which would undermine the public Local Link services everywhere. It is unfortunate that the example the Deputy has raised is caught in the gap between a public bus service and an school service. There is no easy resolution to this, but the NTA will engage with Flexibus to see what steps are possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">Replies I received from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, confirmed that, as of last Thursday, 97,644 tickets had been issued for primary and secondary school transport, not including transport for students with special educational needs. The comparable figure this time last year was 103,764. That is a difference of 6,120 children. That is a lot of children who have been left without a service by the fixed constraints of the school transport scheme. Of course, the 33 children in Skreen are not included in that 6,120. Neither are the hundreds in Leixlip, north Louth, north Wexford, Donegal or Mayo. I could go on.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> Can the Minister confirm the real numbers? He referred to a figure of 20,000. Is that the number of students who have been excluded this year for these reasons? What solutions will he, his Department, the NTA, Bus Éireann, the Department of Education and Skills and the Government as a whole provide for these children?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">Those 20,000 children have not been excluded. That was an historic reference to the number of children who were on private bus services not operated by the Department of Education and Skills. In most instances, these children travel longer distances than to the local school.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">For that reason, they are not included within the scheme run by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The Deputy referred to 6,000 fewer school transport tickets having been issued. That issue, which falls under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills, relates to parents having various views in terms of how they operate within the Covid pandemic period. Indeed, the situation is changing because the Department of Education and Skills is having to look at revising the number of buses that are available in order to meet the Department of Health recommendations regarding the 50% capacity limit. There will be further changes to the school bus system but I do not believe they will solve the local issue raised by the Deputy because the service in question falls outside the catchment of the Department of Education and Skills.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">2. <b>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</b> asked the <b>Minister for Transport</b> if the demands of representative groups of taxi drivers will be agreed to, namely, to dissolve the taxi advisory committee and instead establish a national transport forum with strong representation from these representative groups, to extend the ten-year rule for replacing taxis to 12 years, to instigate an immediate moratorium on the issues of licence and to establish a licence buy-back scheme for taxi drivers wishing to exit the industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_19">As I have repeatedly stated to the Minister and his predecessor in recent months, the clock is ticking on the dire situation faced by taxi drivers. They believe they have no choice but to organise another demonstration, to be held on 9 October, because of the failure of the Government to give commitments and assurances about supporting them through income subsidies, extending the ten-year replacement rule to 12 years, a moratorium on the issuing of licences, grants to cover ongoing costs, a buy-back scheme for those who wish to exit the industry and disbanding the taxi advisory committee. Will the Minister give those supports and commitments as requested?</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_10" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I met delegates from four taxi representative groups the week before last. It was a useful and productive meeting at which I had an opportunity to hear about the impact of Covid-19 on the taxi industry and the representatives' proposals as to how the industry can best be supported through this difficult time. I undertook to meet representatives again in the near future once I had an opportunity to consider fully these issues with my Department and the NTA. I confirm that I intend following through on that commitment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I have no plans to dissolve the advisory committee on small public service vehicles, sometimes known as the taxi advisory committee, at this time. This is because the committee has played an important role in advising my Department and the NTA on the issues facing the industry and on how to assist it through the pandemic and ensure its future sustainability. In July, following a request from my predecessor, the then Minister, Shane Ross, the committee submitted a report with several recommendations. Since then, my Department has worked with the committee to examine how these can be addressed. We have shared the report with other Departments and it has served as a useful basis for engagement to ensure that small public service vehicle, SPSV, operators, many of whom are self-employed, are able to access to the greatest extent possible the range of measures the Government has introduced to support businesses through these difficult circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The advisory committee, which was established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, enjoys a broad membership, with members representing driver interests, dispatch operators, passenger interests and official stakeholders such as local government and An Garda Síochána. This diversity of representation, combined with members' commitment to having a well-functioning and effective SPSV sector, is a real strength of the committee. My Department will continue to engage from time to time with stakeholder groups, including driver representative groups, but the advisory committee has been and will remain the central focus of engagement with the SPSV sector regarding issues affecting the sector. In addition, the NTA, as statutory regulator for the sector, will continue to engage with the industry and communicate regularly with individual SPSV operators regarding the impact of Covid.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_24">I note that the issue of age limits for taxis is a matter for the industry regulator, that is, the NTA. I remind the House that the NTA has already extended age limits for vehicles that were due to reach the limit between March 2020 and the end of the year. This regulatory change by the NTA means that since the start of the pandemic no operator has needed to replace his or her vehicle due to vehicle age limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> I understand the NTA will continue to monitor the situation and will consider the need for any further extension later this year. This is a proportionate and reasonable approach that allows for appropriate and timely decisions to be taken in response to the prevailing circumstances. Of course, these vehicle age limits exist in the first place because the regulator recognises that newer vehicles are generally safer, more comfortable for passengers and more environmentally friendly. Therefore, we can expect any further extension of vehicle age limits to be targeted and limited, balancing the interests of SPSV operators and the wider public and passenger interest. This Government has committed to continue supporting the greening of the taxi fleet and will continue to provide financial assistance to drivers to switch to battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. My Department has several specific initiatives to encourage the movement away from fossil fuels in the small public service vehicle sector. As such, I would not favour a blanket extension of age limits of the type sought by taxi representatives as it would conflict with these important priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> I know that some taxi representative groups have called for a moratorium on the issuance of new SPSV licences. Current demand for new taxi licences has collapsed to a small fraction of previous application levels and as such it is not clear how preventing new applications would assist the industry through its current difficulties. In any event, for the past two decades the Government has not exercised quantitative controls on the issuance of taxi licences. Prior to the abolition of those controls, the country, and Dublin in particular, suffered from a chronic undersupply of taxis. The abolition of the controls was necessary to address these supply issues. Over the past two decades, this policy has served passengers well. As I do not believe passenger interests would be served by the reintroduction of quantitative controls, I do not favour imposing a moratorium on the issuance of SPSV licences at this time. When I met taxi driver representatives, they outlined a type of buy-back scheme for taxi licences but, in view of the fact that there are no quantitative controls on entry into the SPSV industry, I do not see a basis for such a scheme.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_27">In all that chatter, there was no clear commitment. The Government cut the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, of many taxi drivers who now have even less work available to them because of the new restrictions and there is no income subsidy for those who are able to return to work. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. They are in a dire situation but there has been no commitment by the Government. Will it commit to not cutting their PUP if they must stay off work and that the payment will give them the income subsidy? Incredibly, licences continue to be issued while the industry is on its knees and there is 70% less work available for the fleet. Taxi drivers have, on average, €11,000 of costs, which are clocking up all the time while there is no work available to them. They are not getting grant support in that regard. They have asked for the implementation of a buy-back scheme for drivers who wish to exit the industry but that has not been done. The last two actual taxi driver representatives on the taxi advisory committee left it because it is completely unfit for purpose, does not represent the interests of taxi drivers and does not put forward demands that would protect their livelihoods and industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I cannot give clear commitments on the matter now because we must sit down again with taxi representative groups in advance of so doing. As I stated to those groups, I wish to sit down with the Department and the NTA. I discussed the matter with the NTA this week. My Department had similar meetings with the NTA and will do so again next week before we have further discussions with the taxi representative groups. I wish to sit down with those groups. I listened to them identify the real and critical problems facing the industry, which is in real difficulty, as are many other industries, and I am committing to doing whatever we can to help it get through this difficult time. However, I wish to have a chance to talk to the representative associations and go through the possibilities rather than make commitments in the Dáil before my Department and the NTA have sat down to tease out the possible changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> It is certain and clear that the Government is looking to support taxi drivers through this difficult time, not just in Dublin, but across the country. They are a vital part of our transport infrastructure and they must survive this pandemic period and come out the other side. I am convinced that they will do so and I hope that we will end up with a better service for taxi drivers and their customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">It was not a good start for the Government to cut taxi drivers' PUP payments at the same time as it imposed restrictions that would even further reduce the amount of work available to the drivers. The Minister really needs to get a move on and give those assurances. The taxi drivers do not wish to hold another protest, but they believe they have no other choice because they are in desperate straits.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> On the ten-year replacement rule, that could be changed now. The drivers do not have the money to replace their vehicles. It is not true to state that this issue will not arise until the end of the year because the drivers need to know 90 days in advance whether they are going to renew their licence for their existing car, buy a new car or leave the industry. They need to know these things now. It is clear they have no faith in the taxi advisory committee. They were part of it but their last two representatives left it because it simply was not representing their interests. I appeal to the Minister to get a move on because taxi drivers are in a dire situation. Words, tea and sympathy are not enough. They need concrete assurances and real supports to get them through this period.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">We will act quickly on this issue but we need to get it right. I need to work with the Department and the NTA to make sure we go back to the industry representatives with clear measures that are doable. Not all of them will be doable, but wherever a measure is possible, we will act, such as by extending the PUP into next year. The Government has not ruled out further revising the PUP if that is needed because the pandemic lasts longer or is more severe than expected. There is no shortage of support available. The €3.5 billion payment so far under the PUP is just a part of what must be done. I commit to going back to speak to taxi representative groups again. Where it is possible to take practical measures that improve their lot and maintain a proper taxi service, we will so do. It will not be easy and not every measure will be achievable, but I certainly commit to look at each of them. I listened to the representative groups with real respect. I will meet them again. Where we can amend things, we will do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">It should not escape the attention of the Minister that 40% of the Priority Questions that have been tabled are on the issue of taxis. Rather than having a repeat of his exchange with Deputy Boyd Barrett, I ask the Minister to focus on the financial package for taxi drivers for which he is advocating as the Minister with responsibility for the sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_35">Rather than reading out the full reply I have before me, I will focus on the financial aspect of this issue. The fundamental problem is that there is no way to replace the passenger demand for taxis that has been lost during the pandemic. It will only return as the pandemic is brought under control and economic activity across all sectors recovers. However, the Government measures should ensure that operators who wish to remain in the industry will be able to do so, enabling them to thrive again once the pandemic abates. Many taxi drivers have been able to avail of the pandemic unemployment payment and it will remain open to new applicants for the remainder of the year. It is an important lifeline for SPSV operators. Many of them may have gone back to work as the economy began to reopen only to find that subsequent necessary public health measures once again suppressed passenger demand for their services. The continued accessibility of the PUP will provide an important safety net to operators, recognising their dependency on other sectors of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">SPSV operators who come off the pandemic unemployment payment can avail of the Covid-19 enterprise support grant. This one-off grant, worth up to €1,000, can be used towards the costs associated with reopening a business which can include the purchase of cleaning materials, approved dividing screens and personal protective equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> Self-employed SPSV operators, who were profitable in 2019 but not in 2020 due to Covid-19, may be able to avail of an income tax relief allowing for up to €20,000 of losses from this year to be offset against profits from 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> Many SPSV operators have car loans for their vehicles and, therefore, may be able to benefit from the Government's credit and liquidity measures. The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme provides for loans at a discounted interest rate backed by the Government. The Covid-19 business loans scheme provides for loans of up to €25,000 interest free for six months, with a Government rebate available for the interest payable for the following six months.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">I am glad the Minister mentioned the enterprise support grant. Taxi drivers are reporting that it can take up to 11 weeks for applications to be processed and in that time they are supposed to be back at work and earning. They do not have the reserves to get back to work. That delay needs to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> I will give an example from my constituency of an application under the credit guarantee scheme. One of my constituents who was refused a low interest loan on a Monday under the credit guarantee scheme was given a loan by the same bank on Wednesday of the same week to buy the same car at an interest rate of 9%. I want the Minister to look into that. It seems the scheme is not operating as intended and certainly not to the benefit of taxi drivers.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> Is there a proposal to increase the pandemic unemployment payment to €350? What will be considered in the budget? What proposals is the Minister making? What is in the mix?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_42">I would appreciate if the Deputy would provide me with details of the examples he gave. If there is an eight-week delay in processing the applications for the enterprise support grant, I would be keen to know that and I would check up with the relevant authorities as to why that happened. Similarly, if there are instances where an application under the credit guarantee scheme was refused only for the same bank to approve the loan under a separate scheme, I would appreciate if the Deputy would provide the details because I would get my Department to follow up.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> With regard to the pandemic unemployment payment, that is obviously a matter for the budget and the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance to decide. My understanding is this will not be exclusively a matter for the budget process and we may need an ongoing review process. We will have to establish a recovery fund later this year which will give us flexibility in how we manage the pandemic into next year. That may well include revisions, extensions and alterations, as appropriate, to either the pandemic unemployment payment or the employment wage subsidy scheme. However, that is not an issue for me to decide. It is for the Cabinet collectively to decide in the remaining months of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">I welcome the Minister's statement that he will engage with taxi drivers. They have clearly set out their requests and they want the Minister, who is their Minister at the Cabinet table, to articulate their position on expanding the Covid PUP and also the step-down payment. The Minister needs to hear that loudly and clearly from this side of the House and from taxi drivers. Taxi drivers need to hear from the Minister, both in the House and at the Cabinet table. That is a clear and reasonable ask.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> Another issue that taxi drivers have raised time and again is insurance costs. I would like to hear from the Minister a clear statement on his asks of the Government in the run-in to the budget and on his efforts to address the high cost of insurance.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">Insurance is a critical issue, on which reports from the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will have a material bearing. The Government will have to assess those reports and act on them to bring down the cost of insurance for everyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> With regard to the meeting with the taxi drivers and the range of issues that they rightly raised, the critical issues are the industry specific ones, including the lifetime of vehicles, access for taxis to bus lanes and protective measures within the cab. Those and the industry specific restart, credit and other support mechanisms are the issues on which I will have to focus.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> On the characteristics of the pandemic unemployment payment as a universal social welfare payment, it would be difficult and possibly incorrect to start moving away from the universality of the social welfare system because we would end up with whole categories of people falling behind or losing out. That is not an easy adjustment to make for a specific industry. However, where there are industry specific measures we can take for taxi drivers, I will focus on those. Looking at future licensing applications and the types of vehicles and supports for that are where there is real potential for us to help the industry through this difficult time.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_51">I thank the Deputy for his question.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> The Government's approach to international travel to date has sought to protect public health and contain the disease while respecting that in certain circumstances travel will be essential. Under the plan for living with Covid-19, it is proposed that Ireland will broadly support the European Commission proposals on a co-ordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. We will continue to engage with member states and the Commission to develop a regime that is consistent with the public health requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The European Commission proposal is to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within EU. A co-ordinated approach among member states requires joint efforts on four key points: the application of common criteria and thresholds in deciding whether to introduce restrictions to free movement; the mapping of common criteria using an agreed colour code; the adoption of a common approach as to the measures applied to persons moving to and from areas identified as higher risk; and providing the public with clear, comprehensive and timely information about any restrictions and accompanying requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> The proposal from the Commission is still under consideration by member states, but there are three components. These are common use of EpiData to determine which country is on which list, quarantine or self-restrictions, and testing at airports. Preparations for the implementation of the European Commission proposal will ensure that the establishment of pre-departure or on-arrival testing arrangements for incoming travellers do not impact on the testing and tracing of symptomatic patients and serial testing of high-risk groups or workplace environments.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> My Department is, therefore, engaging with Department of Health and the HSE in looking at possible ways to provide for a robust testing or screening regime that is consistent with public health requirements and cognisant of resources and capacity available in the health sector for the testing and tracing of the general public, to allow for an increase in international travel.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">I thank the Minister of State. It is abundantly clear that the aviation sector is in crisis. As has been documented internationally, we have imposed tighter strictures on the level of activity in the sector. We have Brexit coming down the tracks and people will need access to air travel in order to create new connections and to open new markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> I am not sure how widely we have been looking at testing rather than waiting for the European Union to come up with possible opportunities. I raised in the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response some time ago the availability of antigen testing, which has not been examined. These are short-term, 20-minute turnaround tests that could be used in aviation. I cannot understand why they are not being spoken about or approached.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> I would welcome the idea of a Europe-wide protocol on aviation. However, we are probably not on many countries' green lists and we will not be added to them unless we can get something done in the community here. However, I would like to see greater priority given to the issue of testing and quick turnaround tests.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">The DAA is exploring options for Covid testing involving modelling against a possible new approach to international travel requirements in line with the European co-ordinated approach to help assess the possible business and public health interests under different scenarios. It will factor in projected passenger demand and availability of testing supply capacity and that will inform our decision making. A significant concern is that whatever testing regime is put in place, it should not have an impact on our own public health testing capacity. We are all mindful of that. I agree that getting international travel back is essential. It is critical that we do so in a safe way that is evidence based. </p>

            <p eId="para_61">I reiterate the importance of the aviation sector to Ireland. As the Minister of State is probably aware, Ireland is the world's largest aircraft leasing centre. In addition, particularly in respect of Ryanair, there is the question regarding services into Cork, Shannon and Knock. Will the Minister of State give an update on Waterford Airport's application for funding under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport? It was to get a new runway. We hope that having got past Covid strictures, we can get services into Waterford. It is important to have a south-eastern regional airport link.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">On testing, it is important that we align ourselves broadly with Europe. The European proposal is a Commission recommendation for Council consideration on 13 October for adoption as a Council recommendation. The proposal is being dealt with under the interior and home affairs branch of the Commission. Initial indications from the Irish permanent representation are that this will be a challenging proposal for member states also. The issue of testing is complicated and is the subject of a great deal of discussion, including in my Department. I met representatives of the DAA yesterday. The officials in the Department also met the HSE and the Department of Health on our approach. Every focus and effort is being put into the testing regime and ensuring we can do that.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">As a result of Covid-19, the challenge facing the aviation industry is unprecedented, and Irish airports have been fully exposed to the dramatic downturn in activity. I absolutely appreciate the effects that this could have on the long-term economic viability of airports, particularly smaller aviation enterprises like Ireland West Airport Knock. </p>
            <p eId="para_68"> The Government is committed to doing what it can to support the industry, while having regard to the many other demands on the Exchequer. </p>
            <p eId="para_69"> In order to assist business and protect employment, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of generalised supports for all companies, such as wage subsidy schemes, grants, low-cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities. Up to the end of August, Ireland's smallest regional airports, including Ireland West Airport Knock, had received or were in the process of applying for supports to a value of almost €700,000. </p>
            <p eId="para_70"> In addition, and in line with priorities for regional development, the Government is also providing €6 million in grant aid for safety and security related measures under the regional airports programme in 2020. To date this year, Ireland West Airport Knock has received over €1 million in capital investment and will be eligible to apply for operational supports in the coming weeks. A new regional airports programme for 2021 to 2025 is also being finalised, which will help regional airports, like Ireland West Airport Knock, to remain viable as they begin to plan for recovery and transition away from the devastation of Covid-19. </p>
            <p eId="para_71"> All support mechanisms for the aviation sector will continue to be reviewed in the context of the Government’s plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the aviation task force.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">The Minister of State referred to loans being available. The sad reality is that for airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock, income is €4 million less this year. One can borrow money but how can one repay it if there is no income? There has been a 50% reduction in the workforce. There is a focus on many things. The Minister of State has met people in Dublin Airport. Has she met people such as Mr. Joe Gilmore in Ireland West Airport Knock or anyone in Shannon Airport to hear their frustration? The Minister of State will understand, as she comes from Galway. The situation in the west of Ireland is unique because of the number of youngsters who had to take the plane when the country went broke. Regional airports are the link that keeps many families together and which make the west accessible to get to places like England rather than taking three hours to get to Dublin and queue for ages. If people from the west have to go through Dublin Airport, they will not bother returning every weekend, as it is too much hassle. Is the Government prepared to ensure those airports, whether Ireland West Airport Knock, Shannon or Cork, are kept viable and kept going?</p>

            <p eId="para_73">I am also aware of the importance of our regional airports and ensuring that we maintain that connectivity. I have visited Knock Airport and have had meetings with all the airports since my appointment. I am acutely aware of the pressures they and their staff are under and the great work and difficult decisions that many regional airports have had to make over recent weeks and months.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> Ireland West Airport Knock is not alone in experiencing the stresses that many regional airports and the airline sector are under. In July, I announced supports of €2.5 million for capital investment in areas of safety and security in Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West airports, the latter having received €1 million. Further funding will be available for operational support to a total value of €3.5 million. I will continue to work on this. </p>

            <p eId="para_75">The only problem with capital investment is that it does not help with the day-to-day running costs of an airport. I am asking the Minister of State to be very mindful that everything has focused on Dublin Airport. There is a danger for Cork, Shannon and Ireland West that if things continue as they are, they will not survive and we will lose the regional airports. Will the Minister of State give a commitment to secure the future of the regional airports whatever it takes?</p>

            <p eId="para_76">There was funding for capital investment. A process will also open up for regional airports to access operational support under the Government's regional airports programme. Historically, Ireland West Airport Knock has been well supported by Government-backed programmes. Last year it received €9.4 million in Exchequer funding. This year, I intend to bring forward a regional airports programme for a five-year period starting in 2021. That will ensure ongoing capital and operational supports for airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I assure the Deputy that the Government recognises the value of our regional airports in relation to connectivity, tourism, the local area and jobs within the regions. I will continue to work with the aviation stakeholders, as will my officials. It is in everyone's interest that the airports, like all businesses, are in a good position to contribute to Ireland's post-pandemic recovery. That is a commitment that I give the Deputy today. </p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_83">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 26 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_84"> There are important and differing views on this issue across the House. It is a critical issue and we must consider whether to reopen phases 2 and 3 of the western rail corridor. Regardless of our views on this proposal, what we all agree on is that we need to make a decision soon. On 1 July, my Department received from Iarnród Éireann a copy of EY's report on the proposal. That report was prepared in accordance with the commitment given in the current national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> As was signalled publicly at the time of its commissioning, the report is subject to a short independent review to inform my consideration fully prior to bringing the matter to the Government. However, Deputies can rest assured that this independent review will be completed soon and, importantly, can add real value to the process. It is being conducted by Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions, JASPERS, an agency established by the European Union and the European Investment Bank, EIB. JASPERS has vast experience in advising member states and public authorities on regional development proposals such as the proposed reopening of phases 2 and 3 of the corridor. Its analysis will provide a broader perspective on issues such as the potential wider economic impact, freight services and climate impact and a view on the potential for securing EU funds if the proposal were to go ahead. Deputies will acknowledge the importance of all these issues as we consider the matter and an independent perspective on the question of freight is something that I am particularly keen to see. The work is expected to be completed shortly and I will then bring the matter to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> Since I have the time, I will elaborate on that last issue. I have had a series of discussions with people interested in the project, including those to whom the Deputy referred. We need to consider this matter, not just as it relates to the section of the rail line between Athenry and Claremorris, but in the wider regional context. I would go even farther south and add to this the potential reopening of the Foynes freight rail line, which I understand is a prerequisite if Foynes is to get any support in developing as a European TEN-T international port, in that the port in any such development must have rail freight capability. That makes sense because Europe is moving towards rail freight as a significant part of our climate change agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> We are going to examine this possibility in real detail. If we include it, and I believe we should, then it opens up a strategic question. Putting in a rail connection between Athenry and Claremorris opens up the whole north west to the rail freight capability of Foynes, which is a high-quality deepwater port. From an industrial economic perspective and in light of the bigger picture of a zero-carbon world by 2050, we will have to develop a very large renewable wind energy capability offshore in the west. In the Shannon area and the wider west, we have significant clean water resources that modern manufacturing industry needs. In the north west, we have some of the most advanced and best manufacturing capability in the world, including high-quality expertise in high-quality manufacturing. Put clean power, clean water and a highly educated and highly skilled manufacturing workforce together and we have a long-term economic potential like what we have in Ballina and what we had in Asahi. This industrial development would be on the back of an international rail freight capability, which would allow us to access international ports.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> I would extend the development farther from the Limerick-Shannon-Foynes connection to Waterford. We would then start to have an island-wide spine of rail freight capability that also delivered passenger capability. I am keen on examining the overall question from this wider perspective. It would change the perspective on what we were doing.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">I agree with everything the Minister said. He does not have to sell the project to me or my colleagues in the Chamber, but we need action on it. This is a shovel-ready project and the time for tweaking and talking is over. We are impatient. We need the Minister to do what he says he will do. The reopening has been included in every plan, including the sustainable public transport infrastructure plan. The regional spatial and economic strategy reads:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_91">(a) It shall be an objective to deliver the Athenry - Tuam - Claremorris - Sligo Rail to an appropriate level of service and to a standard capable of facilitating passenger and freight transport.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_92">(b) It shall be an objective to progress through pre-appraisal and early planning the extension of the railway from Athenry - Tuam - Claremorris - Sligo.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">We know what is needed. This is a vital piece of infrastructure and a chance for the Minister to deliver, regardless of whoever the Taoiseach or the proxy Taoiseach is. It fits everything in terms of sustainability, connectivity and balanced regional development. I call on the Minister to act. Do not be swayed by EY and the many other auditors around. Please, get this started.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">I am reassured by what the Minister has said but it is also important that we focus on the statement that we hear every day in every plan about balanced regional development, given that it is rarely implemented in the west and north west. Recently, the Minister announced an extra four stations on the Luas line at a cost of a few hundred million euro, but what is a few hundred million euro up in Dublin? He also announced the electrification of the Maynooth line, which will cost another few bob. He announced that we would examine the prospect of high-speed rail from Dublin to Belfast, Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Limerick, but there would be nothing for the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_95"> We can call this the Lazarus line. Actually, it would not be Lazarus, but the guy who was at the gate, could not get food and asked people to send a few bob his way.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> According to the figures, Athenry is doing very well because there is a reasonable frequency of trains into town in the morning. In other words, there is a large commuter demand. The population of Tuam is twice Athenry's and the population of Castlebar is three times Athenry's. There are plenty of people in those towns commuting to Galway city. Someone could make it to within approximately ten miles of Galway more quickly by car in the morning, but it is the last three, four, five or six miles that hold people up, depending on the morning. That is where the train scores, as the Minister knows.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> It is time for decisions, not talk. We are just looking for a few bob for the west.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">All of those investments in public transport from Dublin make sense. They have to make sense. One cannot proceed unless one has a good business case. There needs to be the same for rail investment in the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> I have mentioned the freight issue in various meetings I have had with several Deputies. I did so because, if we try to win this project on the basis of it being a commuting route from Tuam or Claremorris to Galway, an argument based on those numbers will be difficult to win.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">However, if one considers the route in a wider strategic context of economic development, it is only when passenger rail services operate on the back of what is really the key strategic benefit - an industrial rail freight capability that brings employment and manufacturing to a region that has clean power, clean water and a highly skilled manufacturing workforce - that this starts to make sense. To my mind, none of the reports to date has examined the question in that broader context. No one has asked the big 20-year or 30-year industrial development question about what we need to do in the north west.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> This would not just be good for the people of the west, but for the whole country. It would bring income, tax breaks and balanced regional development. It is not a Dublin versus anyone else situation. Rather, it makes logical industrial development policy sense. It means that the IDA can go abroad and tell people that, if they want high-quality, guaranteed and low-cost energy, high-quality water supplies, a very good workforce and rail connectivity to an international port that allows them to ship their goods to anywhere in the world, then they would have a choice between Foynes or Waterford as part of a spine that extends right the way up the west.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">The need for this is shown by the fact that we must ask certain questions. For example, are there constraints on the Ballina-Dublin-Waterford rail freight services?

            <p eId="para_109">Why can we not do the same at Castlebar, Westport, Tuam, Athenry and all the other stations along that line? Tuam used to have an industrial rail freight-based system. We know it has worked in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">It makes more sense to focus on that rather than the Tuam commuting route, because a bus route from Tuam into Galway city would provide an equally good service. Rail freight wins the case, in my view, but we need to examine all the options.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">I thank the Minister for his impassioned response. Rail freight does win the case and the Minister does not have to doubt his belief in it. Deputy Canney and I emphasised that point when we spoke to him at the West-On-Track meeting some weeks ago. A total of 1,000 freight trains per year leave Mayo to serve Dublin and Waterford ports. Those freight train journeys displace 20,000 long-distance truck movements annually but there is potential for much more. The Minister is absolutely on track, if I may use that phrase, in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> I recognise that there are constraints. We have one of the highest freight rail costs in the EU. Irish Rail needs to be far more aggressive and competitive in its selling of freight as an opportunity. Deputy Ó Cuív is correct that, if we open up the rail side and drive it on to Sligo, it will increase the attractiveness of the proposal even further. If we open up the passenger side, that opens up the city of Galway as a commutable city in terms of healthcare, work and education. This proposal has always added up. I welcome the Minister's passion and interest. However, after the discussion we had earlier with representatives of Ireland West Airport Knock, he will need that passion to fight against sceptical officials and doubters if he is to advance this project. He will have the support of us all in that fight and I will give him my political support in it. This projects adds up, economically and regionally. I welcome the Minister's passion and commitment as demonstrated here this morning. By God, he will need it over the next few weeks and he will have our backup in that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_114">The debate on these issues has to be reasoned and there must be an economic argument behind it. As I understand it, Iarnród Éireann has commissioned a study by AECOM to look at the future of rail freight. That will be available at the same time as we publish the JASPERS study and the EY-DKM study on the Claremorris-Athenry link. We must be real about this. At the moment, it is mainly fertiliser and other bulk goods coming into Foynes. We have to look at port strategy, which is connected to the rail issue. We need to consider which products would be suited to rail freight transport. In Ballina, for example, it works for Coca-Cola's operations and it also worked in the past for the former Asahi factory. The same is true with sugar beet and so on at Tuam. We have to consider issues such as the development of forestry. We are moving forestry products up and down the country on a road haulage basis. Could some of that be switched to rail freight? I believe it could and I am interested to see what the Iarnród Éireann report will find in terms of what systems are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> The EY-DKM report and other reports argue that the distances are too short in Ireland for rail freight to work and that such systems only work where there are long-distance rail freight trips. My understanding is that the EU is changing its position in this regard. In the case of the development of a europort at Foynes, the requirement for a rail freight solution is because Europe is saying that as part of its low-carbon future, we must switch to rail freight and start designing around it. If I were to go to the Minister for Finance and say I want to build a new rail line from Ballina that extends right up to Sligo and right down to Waterford, I would be told it was a mad idea that would cost €5 billion or €10 billion and it could not possibly be done. However, it would be a different prospect if I were to say to him that we have an existing underused rail line running through Waterford, Clonmel, Tipperary town, Bansha, Limerick Junction and all the way up that has just two small sections missing. In the case of the first, from Limerick to Foynes, a station could be put in at Dooradoyle and another at Adare. The second missing section, the Athenry-Claremorris line, is relatively small and there would be no real difficulty in redeveloping it.</p>

I would take it to the EU's climate action recovery fund and say that this proposal makes economic sense. This is a region with clean power, clean water, manufacturing expertise and two deep-sea ports that can be connected by rail freight. I do not see why it cannot work.</p>

            <p eId="para_122"> In this context, the authority seeks to deliver an efficient, accessible and integrated public transport system in both rural and urban Ireland. It funds public bus services in rural areas through its public service obligation, PSO, arrangements, mainly with Bus Éireann and through the Local Link service. </p>
            <p eId="para_123"> I understand that the Deputy's question relates to a number of PSO services in Cork that are operated by Bus Éireann, namely, the 233 Macroom to Cork route, the 235 Rylane to Cork route, the 236 Castletownbere to Cork route, the 239 Butlerstown to Cork route, and the 243 Newmarket to Cork route.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> Having consulted the NTA in regard to future service plans, I can advise the Deputy that there are no specific plans at present to increase frequency on the routes in question. However, it is important to note that the authority keeps the network of bus services operated by Bus Éireann under regular review and consideration of increased services is part of that review process.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> In regard to Macroom specifically, my understanding is that there were plans for the expansion of services in 2020. Unfortunately, those plans were put on hold, similar to many other projects, as a consequence of the Covid pandemic. My understanding is that the Macroom route will again be taken into consideration. Any development in that regard must fit within the policy approach being taken by the NTA and Local Link services in respect of all routes and the assessment of which will be put forward for prioritisation. I can see the good logic in the proposals for Macroom. Given the plans to proceed with the Macroom bypass project, it makes sense, at the same time, to take steps to deliver high-quality public transport services.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">I thank the Minister for that overview. As he points out, the Macroom service was one of the services identified as being particularly problematic and as offering an opportunity for growth in serving villages such as Ballingeary, Inchigeelagh, Kilmurry, Crookstown, Cloughduv, Aherla and on down to Killumney and Coachford. If one wants to get in and out to Cork city from Coachford, for example, one can get a bus in the morning at 7.40, but to get back home again, one has to be out of the city before 1 p.m. It is not practical. For people living along the Bride Valley who want to get in and out to work, they can get a bus at 7.30 a.m. but they must be out on the Model Farm Road at 4.30 p.m. to get home. That does not suit most people who are going in and out of Cork city.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> There were plans to expand the service, as the Minister outlined, but plans do not get put into place immediately. It takes a bit of background work to take them forward. It should not be the case that we should park all such projects at this time. The coronavirus crisis should not mean that everything stops. Plans should continue in the meantime and there should be a readiness to switch projects back on. I understand that these cannot be advanced overnight but preparations can be made. The Minister referred to the 243 bus service that goes out to Grenagh and on up to Bweeng. Grenagh is 20 minutes from the city centre by car but it feels like a week by bus. Improved services need to be rolled out as soon as possible and the preparatory work must be going on in the background in the meantime.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">One of the most significant things in the programme for Government is the towns first idea, which seeks to bring life back into the centres of towns. I am taking Macroom as an example because it is very familiar to me. It is very important that we have good, high-quality and high-frequency public transport services on services such as the Macroom to Cork route.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">It is also important to integrate local transport services, including Local Link, that have been very successful in Cork. They need to be connected to ensure accessibility to Macroom. In this Covid-19 world, many people living and working in Macroom may have commuted previously or they may be staying in the town to work for three days a week rather than commuting into Cork for work. We need to get right the co-ordination of Local Link services and more regional bus services. We should use examples like Macroom to make sure the hinterland is connected in to that bus service, the timetable works and the system is seamless and integrated.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> Even with the new bypass in Macroom, if we try to develop Ireland on a roads- and car-based transport system, and even if we restrict the numbers of people who commute, we will still reach bottlenecks when we get to the edge of the city and that will not work. The only way of managing our future development is active travel, local travel and Local Link bus services. We need this hierarchy with public transport services between large towns and cities, such as Macroom and Cork. That is the future development of public transport and transport in general in our towns and cities. This holds out the key prospect of restoring towns and bringing life back to the centre of towns. That towns will not be choked full of cars is one of the benefits of this whole process.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">I very much agree with the Minister on supporting services in and out of Macroom. Ballingeary and Inchigeelah only have one bus to Macroom per day, which leaves people having to return home very early in the day. In the absence of bus options, we see huge tailbacks at the Ballincollig bypass near the EMC facility and at Leemount Cross. Macroom is being choked. Bus services to both of those villages need to be improved. People also want to be able to get in and out to Cork and that bus service needs to be advanced. These needs have already been recognised. There are new sewerage schemes in Dripsey, Coachford and Ballyvourney, for example, which are advancing further housing development. There will be a need for bus services to Cork and Macroom. That will not happen instantly but the Minister needs to advance those plans. Background work has already been done on those plans, which should not be parked up. The Minister should be bringing along those plans and making bus service improvements available to people within months, rather than pushing them off into the never-never or for several years.</p>

            <p eId="para_132">I agree with the Deputy. On Macroom specifically, I understand that plans are afoot and quite far advanced in terms of reviewing the frequency of the Cork-Macroom service. Once there has been a restoration of some normal services after the pandemic, I will be supportive should the National Transport Authority, in consultation with regional transport systems, decide that those plans are now ready for development. That would be a very positive development.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 21 and 30 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> I will give a general response to all three questions and I will then specifically address the MetroLink project. I am happy to go into detail on MetroLink, but I should also set out the status of some other major transport projects in the greater Dublin area and the current status of the transport strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> There are three current mega-projects under development in the greater Dublin area, namely, BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink. Each of these projects are multibillion euro investments, among the largest public investment projects ever to be undertaken in the State and each is significant in its own right. Together they have the potential to utterly transform sustainable mobility in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_140"> On BusConnects, I am pleased to see continued progress with today’s announcement of the final network redesign. Implementation of this new network will now commence in 2021 and I very much welcome this move towards implementation. Work is continuing on the development of the preliminary business case and in finalising the infrastructure requirements for the core bus corridors, with another round of public consultation scheduled for November.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> Over the summer, I launched a consultation process on DART+, specifically proposals for the Maynooth line. DART+ will effectively double the capacity of the commuter rail network and is hugely important. Alongside that consultation process, work continues on developing the preliminary business case and assessing tenders received in relation to fleet expansion. As required by the public spending code, all of these preliminary business cases will require Government approval to allow the three projects to progress together, and I expect to bring these business cases to the Government early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> At a strategic level, the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 is being reviewed and will be updated if required. A review is required every six years and the NTA has already commenced work on this, which will include examining the potential for further metro routes into the future. I understand a public consultation will commence next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> On MetroLink, the finalised business case is expected to be submitted to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport during the first quarter of 2021 and brought to Government for its approval in line with the public spending code. It is expected that the railway order and planning permission application will be lodged with An Bord Pleanála next year also. Construction will begin once that procedure is completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">It is my hope and expectation that the business case presented to the Department will be the strongest one possible. I do not know of any other strategic project in planning that meets such a transport deficit. MetroLink links the third largest town in Ireland by population, Swords, with our capital city, our international airport, Dublin Airport, and Dublin City University through Phibsborough and into the city centre. It is vital infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> Many people have asked me and the Acting Chairman, Deputy Alan Farrell, if the issue of MetroLink comes up at the doors when we are canvassing. It does not come up because people in north County Dublin and Swords do not believe it will happen. In recent months, however, people have seen some exploratory works and ground testing taking place. The MetroLink insignia has also been seen on barriers near Seatown Villas and other areas around Swords. That gives people hope that the project will move forward and ultimately be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> I ask that the railway order and the business plan be arranged as early in 2021 as possible. The Minister referred to the first quarter but we have an hourglass for this important project and we cannot allow quarters or years to pass.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I agree with the Deputy. We are 20 years late on this project. We started it in the late 1990s when I was on the Dublin transportation advisory committee. At the same time, the Danish city of Copenhagen was looking at a project involving a similar length of line. In the meantime, I believe Copenhagen has built three metro lines while our project is still stuck in planning. We have to get it out of planning and start building.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> The debate earlier focused on Dublin versus the regions. MetroLink is a critical piece of national infrastructure. The case for it has always been the planning gain. It is not just a metro to Dublin Airport but a project that will allow us to align our housing with sustainable transport systems. It will allow us to plan for sustainable development of housing in the city as well as the development of transport. Transport-led development is where we need to go in addressing our housing crisis. We need real certainty for developers and local councils in the city. We need to tell them that whatever they do, they must ensure new housing is built in close proximity to the new stations that will be in this project. That will guarantee quality of life and an efficient, clean and social city. This is why this project and all the other public transport infrastructure we have are important.</p>
            <p eId="para_149"> The Deputy is right that we need to move into planning. Given that an earlier iteration of the project has already gone through planning and it has probably been the most researched, assessed and tested project on the planet in the 20 years we have waited for it, I hope we can quickly get the business case completed and the project moved into planning and built.</p>

            <p eId="para_150">I am encouraged by the Minister's reply. We have spoken about this outside the Chamber as well. The Minister is consistent in his view on this both behind the scenes and in this House which is very encouraging.</p>
            <p eId="para_151"> The town of Swords, which will benefit from MetroLink, is an example of an area where we can improve active travel, to which the Minister referred in earlier answers. We can improve the cycling infrastructure in order to be able to get people from the west side of Swords to where the MetroLink stations will be located without them having to use their cars. We need to improve walking routes and disability access as well. If and when this is delivered, and I am an optimist on MetroLink, we must make sure that people will not have to get into their cars to travel from one side of Swords to the other. They should be able to travel quickly, efficiently and in an environmentally friendly way to the metro to go to college or into town. This will benefit all of Fingal, particularly those living in the rural villages and rural areas who will be able to get to Swords relatively quickly and then on into Dublin city. It is not just a service for Swords or the airport; it is infrastructure that will benefit the whole of north County Dublin. It is something I will be bringing up on an annoyingly regular basis in this Chamber during these questions and I hope we can continue to see progress on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">Again, I am in danger of agreeing with the Deputy. I will go back, if I can, to the Copenhagen example and how the Danes made it work. These are very expensive pieces of infrastructure. They are multibillion euro projects. Outside the train station in Copenhagen, there is a very low-cost bicycle park that has thousands of bicycles. The surrounding community, through a ten- or 15-minute cycle, has access to the train service that is easy, reliable, quick, clean and cheap. Such low-cost solutions deliver high-quality local communities and attractive places to live which are not dominated by cars and where everyone has good quality connectivity that is not expensive. That is the gain according to the cost-benefit analysis. To go back to what I said earlier, it is the wider planning gain we get from this type of public transport alongside connected, active travel through pedestrian, cycling and local bus service connections. It is that sort of vision and if one costs the benefits from all of that, it makes these projects stand up and make sense and that is why we need to build them now.</p>

            <p eId="para_154">The Government has allocated €10 million to the coach industry, which is very welcome. The fund is to be distributed via Fáilte Ireland. To date, however, not one cent has been allocated. The private hire market has completely collapsed. There are 1,700 operators in the country employing 11,500 people. The aforementioned fund is equivalent to €870 for each of those employees. This is insufficient to deal with the specific problem that the industry faces, an industry that normally carries approximately 75 million passengers per year.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">I assure the Deputy that the Government and the NTA are actively engaged in entering into contractual arrangements for new temporary funding supports with licensed bus operators who are providing necessary public transport services. The NTA and my Department have been engaging directly with commercial bus operators throughout the crisis to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we continue to deal with the impact of Covid-19. I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for so many business sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_156"> Public transport is a key facilitator of interaction in the economy and society. It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for public service obligation, PSO, services and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector. These temporary funding supports have been introduced to help ease the financial pressure on operators arising from the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months and are targeted at covering the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant state aid considerations. The National Transport Authority is responsible for administering the funding support and is in the process of entering into contracts with the relevant operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_157"> These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment, which operators can avail of and remains open to new applicants until the end of the year, and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant that can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. These measures are in addition to rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.</p>

            <p eId="para_158">To synopsise what the Minister has just said, if you are not a licensed bus operator providing a licensed service, if you are not contracted to Bus Éireann, then there is nothing for you. As the Minister knows, the NTA has washed its hands of the industry outside of the licensed sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_159"> I wrote to the Minister and the NTA in August regarding the private school bus operators who had not received even a single sheet of paper on how they should operate their services from 1 September in order to meet the Covid-19 criteria. The NTA came back and said that it was not its problem and I am still waiting for a response from the Minister on that issue. The vast majority of coach operators are being ignored. The only fund that has been put in place is through Fáilte Ireland and not a single cent has been distributed to the operators.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">I am very glad the Deputy mentioned the school transport service which is a key element in the jigsaw of coach and bus operators. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and I met a wide spectrum of operators across tourism, school transport, PSO services and others. However, primary responsibility for managing the engagement with school bus transport providers lies with the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> One of the mechanisms being considered by the Government will hopefully be of benefit to a wide variety of coach operators. Given the public health advice, albeit issued at short notice, on restricting bus capacity, the Department of Education and Skills has been engaged in recent weeks with various operators on the provision of further services and the contracting of additional buses to meet the public health criteria in the provision of the school bus transport service. The Department has indicated that this process will take some time to complete because it is not a small operation. This will involve a very large number of buses and drivers and require a range of systems changes in order to manage the process. I understand that the Department is currently engaged in that process and is in talks with the industry. That may provide one outlet for operators which are otherwise very quiet. There is very little in the way of bringing football teams to matches, there are no tourists and the myriad other vital services the coach and bus industry provides are not available at present. I hope the additional requirements for school bus transport will generate business for operators and help them through the crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">The reality is that the taxi, chauffeur-drive and private school bus operators have been completely ignored by the Government to date. Five weeks ago, I wrote to the Minister regarding the private school bus operators but he has yet to respond to me. These operators do not come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is only interested in those that are contracted to Bus Éireann. In fact, private operators that are providing private services had to borrow copies of the documents that were circulated by Bus Éireann to find out what specifications they needed to meet. That is not good enough. The private hire market has completely collapsed at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_163"> I ask the Minister to intervene with regard to the second level school bus system. Will he explore the possibility of buses bringing half the number of students on a first run and then going back for a second run, to be rotated on a weekly basis? In that way, we could double the capacity of the bus fleet very quickly and help to address some of the problems at second level.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">I would not rule anything out but I would point to one word in what the Deputy said, which is that these are “private” bus operations. I have myself asked the question as to whether we could look at options such as having two runs. However, to make that work, we would have to get into arrangements with the schools and we do not know if they would be happy to have staggered arrival of pupils or whether that gets in their way. Inexorably, we are brought back to the Department of Education and Skills because we would have to get agreement from the schools via that Department as to how that would be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_165"> All of these various options have been looked at. It has to be done in a co-ordinated way in order for solutions to be found. The ultimate solution, I would argue, is for us to be able to stabilise the level of Covid and not have to proceed with this 50%, which would then bring back into operation the system that had been set up through private arrangements. However, that is something we do not have full control over.</p>
            <p eId="para_166"> In the meantime, I will ask the Minister for Education and Skills to follow up on the Deputy’s proposal and on whether this is possible for those schools that have private bus service operations. The difficulty is that some children may come from a local town and some from a further town, and having different arrangements for different students could be very difficult. That may be one of the constraints in terms of a specific solution. However, I will follow up and I will come back to the Deputy if there is any possibility. </p>

            <p eId="para_168">My question relates to the much-needed extension to the Luas green line from Bride’s Glen and Cherrywood. I note that the extension of the Luas lines to Bray, Lucan, Poolbeg and Finglas was included in the National Transport Authority’s 2016 transport strategy for Dublin, and news that the Finglas line is proceeding is welcome. However, residents in the other areas are wondering where they stand. In particular, will the Minister provide an update on the status of the extension to the Luas line from Bray?</p>

            <p eId="para_169">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of public transport in the Bray area, including the issue of light rail. I note, of course, that Bray is set to benefit from investments in BusConnects and DART+, both of which will boost public transport capacity in the area. I am delighted that the final BusConnects network will be published today and that the NTA can move forward with delivery of a much improved network of bus services.</p>
            <p eId="para_170"> The transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is the strategic framework within which transport infrastructure in the region is considered and developed. It has a statutory basis and, importantly, is integrated within land-use plans across the region, thus laying the foundation for a much more sustainable approach toward development generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_171"> The strategy is a 20-year framework and it makes a number of proposals in regard to light rail infrastructure over that period. These proposals include the Luas cross-city, which has been completed, the Luas green line capacity enhancement, which is well under way, and the proposed extensions to Bray, Finglas, Lucan and Poolbeg. Building on the strategy’s recommendations, the current national development plan provided indicative funding toward planning and design of those Luas extensions to Bray, Finglas, Lucan and Poolbeg in the greater Dublin area. Indeed, a number of weeks ago, I was pleased to launch a public consultation on the emerging preferred route option in regard to the proposed Luas Finglas project.</p>
            <p eId="para_172"> The transport strategy’s proposal in regard to extending Luas services to Bray was predicated on an upgrade of the existing Luas green line to metro standard. This was considered a prerequisite in order to ensure sufficient capacity on the line to cope with additional demand generated by the extension. More recently, the Bray transport study was published in 2019 and sets out a number of sustainable mobility interventions designed to facilitate continued population growth in the area. It recommends the introduction of a new bus service from Sandyford to Bray, via Old Conna, until such time as a Luas extension might be delivered, as well as other measures for the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_173">Residents across Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and not just in the Bray area, want to see delivery on public transport improvements. I note what the Minister has said about BusConnects and DART+, which is very welcome. However, development is currently taking place in areas such as Cabinteely, Carrickmines, Cherrywood and Old Conna, to name but a few. I estimate some 50,000 people will be living and working in that area over the next few years. Development plans were agreed on the basis that public transport would be upgraded, along with the extension to the green line. There were three preferred routes back in 2006 and any delays to projects such as the Luas link to Bray or the construction of the new Woodbrook DART station, on which I have another question today, would put serious pressure on the road network. Something needs to happen.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_174">Any development plan should, to my mind, be conditional on real certainty as to where the public transport is going to go in. We should not be developing any area or putting this into any development plan if we do not have concrete certainty around the development of public transport nodes in those areas. Otherwise, we are confining people to a future of car-based dependency, which will not work, will not serve the community and will not serve the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_175"> The issue about the extension of the line beyond Cherrywood will be critically dependent on what happens to the metro and, as I have said, that is not yet even in the planning system. Even when it is, MetroLink will be a project that runs to and stops just south of Ranelagh. There will be a further study looking at the alternatives after that because, for example, if it was to extend in a south-west direction, that would not resolve the problem of capacity on the existing green line. The other options would be to upgrade the green line or to run a spur via UCD and Stillorgan to Sandyford, which would address the capacity issue on the green line.</p>
            <p eId="para_176"> That capacity issue is not a short-term issue. We should be very careful to say to Wicklow County Council and others that they should not be developing sites for projects or housing in areas on a speculative basis where we think there might be particular projects down the line. We should focus on those areas where we know there is expansion, with BusConnects and with the DART+ programme, and where we know the Luas extensions, for example, the Finglas extension, are going to come. We have to start integrating planning and development. I, more than anyone else, will support public transport extensions but we cannot have housing where we do not have certainty we will have public transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">While I agree with the Minister's view about future development, the development plans are under way and I hope the Minister's office will contact the relevant local authorities. As I mentioned, the Cabinteely, Carrickmines, Cherrywood, Shankill and northern Bray area has enormous development already planned and, on the back of that, it is anticipated public transport will be delivered. In fact, many of the developments that have happened are on the back of the idea that public transport will be delivered in those areas. One of those projects is the Luas green line, the B2 line, which, as I said, had three options. People want a high-frequency, high-capacity link from Bride’s Glen to Bray. In addition, and as the Minister mentioned, there are key employment areas such as Sandyford, Dundrum and Cherrywood. It is critical that we have an alternative to the car, that it is a reliable service and that the capacity is there to accommodate all of those people living and working in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_178"> I ask the Minister to commit that, in the national development plan, we fast-track and reconsider that extension to the Luas line.</p>

            <p eId="para_182">I am as frustrated as anyone with the congestion that grips Galway and that has the potential to choke the city’s social, cultural and economic development. I am acutely aware of the need to implement improvements urgently to the city’s transport network, centred on the hierarchy of pedestrian, cyclist and public transport. While the Deputy will know that I am long aware of these issues, they were reinforced yet again in meetings I had with various representative and interest groups from the city and region since assuming office. I am determined that my Department will provide the right type of policy framework and the overall levels of funding required to enable delivery on the ground by local authorities of the infrastructure set out in their various transport strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_183"> I hope that this summer’s July stimulus provided a signal as regards our intentions. I emphasised the need for the rapid roll-out of active travel measures and allocated significant funding for that very purpose. During the summer, I met with Galway City Council and urged it to take advantage of this funding and roll out new and improved active travel infrastructure to support local communities and businesses as they learn to live with Covid. July’s stimulus also contained additional money for new and improved bus services, including in Galway, and I know the NTA is continuing to develop and plan those services with the operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_184"> While the local authority is at the heart of delivering change in Galway, I know central government needs to support it in ways over and above pure funding and needs to consider issues such as technical support. In this regard, this year, the NTA established a park and ride development office, which is working with local authorities to deliver park and ride in all the cities, and that office is also working with Galway City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">I am also aware that the county council, in co-operation with Iarnród Éireann, is also exploring options to further improve facilities at Oranmore station. From conversations with other Deputies from the Galway area, including the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and Deputy Grealish, I understand that park-and-ride facilities were introduced on the site of Galway Airport. This was close to the Parkmore industrial estate and the route travelled by some coming in from the east of the city. I am interested in hearing from the Deputy as to why that project did not progress after its operation on a trial basis. These are practical quick wins we should be looking at as potential ways of delivering facilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">I appreciate the Minister's frustration, engagement and determination but 15 years have passed and park-and-ride facilities have not been operated in Galway. There was a failed attempt by the chamber of commerce to run a facility at the former airport site when the airport fell. This project was not led by the city council. Indeed, its planners advised against it. Park-and-ride facilities have never been rolled out except at Christmas, when they are very successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_187"> Some 15 years later, what are we going to do about this? It is clear the council will not implement such facilities. I am told it has made progress in identifying sites but this measure is not going ahead because it is utterly dependent on the ring road, which may or may not go ahead. Once again, we are putting all our eggs in one basket and failing to deal with traffic congestion in Galway. Park-and-ride facilities are just one aspect of this. I agree with the Minister that we also need an integrated school transport service and so on but this will not happen because of the doublespeak regarding a road which will sort out all our problems and a failure to take action.</p>

            <p eId="para_188">I agree with Deputy Connolly. I had a series of meetings with representatives of the various cities across the country this summer and I was disappointed and felt that Galway was missing out most on the opportunities afforded by investing in active travel, public transport and sustainable solutions. I agree that, if the city authorities believe that waiting for a ring road to solve their problems will make matters better, they are making a fundamental mistake. Real urgency is required in the delivery of public transport solutions, greenways and active travel measures. The funding is not the problem. There seems to be a problem in getting resources together locally to deliver projects that have, by and large, been agreed. I will continue to press for that and to push for those solutions because they are the way forward. They will allow Galway to thrive.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus leis an Aire. Sa tseachtain atá amach romhainn, tiocfaidh deireadh leis an sos a dtugtar do shealbhóirí morgáistí agus d'aisíocóirí mar gheall ar Covid-19. Beidh tionchar aige seo ar na mílte daoine agus teaghlach ar fud na tíre. Beidh na daoine seo i riaráistí agus i dtrioblóid le haisíocaíochtaí muna gcuidíonn an Rialtas leo. Impím ar an Aire, ar an Rialtas, ar na bainc agus ar na hiasachtóirí eile céimeanna a ghlacadh agus cinneadh a dhéanamh go sínfear amach an sos seo. Níl fágtha anois ach sé lá leis sin a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> In March, the Government, the five main retail banks and their representative body, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, announced measures to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on borrowers. These measures also involved other non-bank lenders. Among the measures introduced was a three-month payment break for mortgage customers, which was later extended to six months. These payment breaks were introduced in response to the introduction of guidelines by the European Banking Authority. These guidelines stated that, where payment breaks were implemented appropriately, loans would not go into default. </p>
          <p eId="para_191"> According to the Central Bank, 74,000 payment breaks have been granted to mortgage holders since the beginning of the pandemic. Nearly 40,000 of these have availed of an additional extension to their break. These payment breaks are, however, due to come to an end and no provision has been made for those whose breaks are to come to an end or for what will happen afterwards. With unemployment rates remaining sky high and cuts made to the pandemic unemployment payment by the Government taking effect from yesterday, many borrowers are facing imminent default. </p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The situation is no less grave for our small and medium enterprises. The Central Bank estimates that a quarter of SMEs have applied for Covid-19 payment breaks since May. With further restrictions now possible, the ability of many of those businesses to return to regular repayments is in doubt. </p>
          <p eId="para_193"> While the option of taking payment breaks of three to six months has been offered by Irish lenders, measures across Europe have differed. In Germany, breaks of nine months were offered while breaks of 12 months were offered to borrowers in Spain, Italy and Portugal. Covid-19 and the public health measures necessary to contain its spread will be with us and with the economy for some time to come. Many of those who have become unemployed will remain so for some time and many of those who lost income will not see it recover for some time. Many businesses whose trading has been disrupted will not be in a position to return to normal activity for some time. Unless these payment breaks are extended in the context of Covid-19, many of these borrowers will fall into default. That is the sad reality of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> This is very concerning. The European Banking Authority's deadline for the application of its guidelines is 30 September, which is next Wednesday, six days away. Our banks and non-bank lenders must extend payment breaks before then or many of these borrowers will fall into default. We are quickly running out of time. I have been raising this issue with the Minister for Finance for some time but he has refused to act. I have also raised it with the Central Bank and have met its representatives in that regard. I have contacted all five main retail banks in the State. This is what the Minister for Finance should be doing. Urgent action is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> We read in the <i>Irish Daily Mail </i>that the Minister for Finance is to meet the banks on Monday. That is two days before the deadline - 48 hours. It is simply too late. Will the Minister ensure that the Government, with Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, the retail banks and the non-bank lenders, urgently announces an extension to the payment breaks granted in the context of Covid-19? Will he ensure that interest will not be accrued during such payment breaks, a measure permitted under the guidelines?</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I share Deputy Doherty's concern for those in difficulty because of Covid-19, not only with regard to mortgage repayments, but a whole range of financial issues. It is a critical issue. If one is facing a particular debt problem, it sharpens and brings into focus a real difficulty. I roll in with the Deputy in saying that those who are in such a position, and who will have to act quickly in advance of 30 September, should, if they intend to make an application, do so in this short interim period.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> That will not be the end of the issue and it does not mean that it will not be possible after that period for banks to continue offering loan payment breaks on a case-by-case basis. That is not ruled out by the European regulations. This comes from the European regulatory system and it does not preclude doing so. Even after 30 September, it is our experience of managing such issues that it is always best for customers to approach the banks and engage with them so that the issue is not put off to become a greater difficulty later. It is better to work to resolve these issues than to ignore them. </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> If customers experience difficulties in how banks deal with them and how this is managed, they may work with the Central Bank's consumer protection unit and make use of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. Banks cannot act in a way that is completely contrary to good public policy and the public interest. They have to consider the wider issue and deal with customers fairly. Failing that, the State offers other supports. It is never ideal to be in such circumstances but systems are in place through the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and other offices to provide supports and advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has central responsibility for this issue and is, as was reported in the newspapers today, due to meet the banks. I am sure he will remind them that, as I have said, this is not a time to clamp down on customers but a particularly severe period of financial difficulties which we must get through.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">In everything we are doing it is recognised that exceptional tolerance and spending are required of the Government in a whole variety of ways to support customers. We have to abide by the regulations as set out by the European Banking Authority. The members of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland will have to ensure the new arrangements do not lead to a further shock to the economy, which does not need further shocks. I am confident that the Minister will express that clearly to the banks and that they will work with him and the Central Bank to ensure that we avoid this becoming a further difficulty for the economy and a particular section of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Individual banks can always extend a payment break. They always could and always will be able to do that. However, what it means for customers is that they will be in default and will have a negative credit rating. What it means for the banks is that they will have to hold additional capital. The European Banking Authority has recognised the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic across Europe. The authority has said that if a bank announces a payment break before the end of this month, which is in six days' time, its customers will not be in default and the bank does not hold additional capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The Minister talks about how the banks can do this and that and about the consumer protection code. We are in a unique position. Tens of thousands of homeowners will fall into default in the coming days. Tens of thousands of businesses have staff who cannot go back to work and who have loans in respect of which the banks will start asking for full payment. What is the position of the Government? The State is the majority shareholder in Allied Irish Banks and Permanent TSB and a significant shareholder in Bank of Ireland. Does the Minister have a position on this? Does the Government have a position on it? Only six days are left to announce a payment break. Otherwise every borrower will be on his or her own.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The problem is that there is consistency in this. This Government is failing to tackle the meat plants, insurance industry and banks. Who is always left with it? It is the ordinary individuals. There is a system in place that we can avail of. The Government should do the right thing and not leave it until the last minute. I cannot understand why this has come down to the wire. We need to protect these borrowers, homeowners, businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">There are a range of different circumstances depending on the individual circumstances. Some people are now going back to work and payments are starting again. For others who are not going back to work and who are in difficulty, the Government position is clear. Lenders must work with their borrowers and put in place new payment arrangements that are suitable for borrowers who are still experiencing difficulty at the end of a Covid-19 payment break. Lenders are obliged to engage and work with co-operating borrowers to identify an appropriate and sustainable solution having regard to the particular circumstances of a case. It is done on a case-by-case basis but there is an obligation, from the Government's perspective, on all banks to work with customers who are willing to engage to avoid default or other difficult circumstances. For some borrowers, temporary additional supports may be the answer. In this regard, we have to be clear. The European Banking Authority has made clear that banks can continue to support their customers with an extended payment break after 30 September. The authority is making a Europe-wide regulatory change but that does not preclude banks from applying the same break measures that allow customers to get through this period on a specific case-by-case basis. However, it has to be on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">Last Wednesday, 80 people were on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick. I am familiar with the hospital as it is my local main acute hospital. That is worrying. I am used to such figures in the depths of January and February but not in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Today, the Government launched the winter initiative from the HSE. I understand it was launched late but had been ready for some time. The Government is saying there are 1,500 new beds. A total of 830 new acute beds were announced but 409 of these are actually already in place. Similarly, some 63 new critical care beds were announced but 45 are already in place. That means only an extra 18 beds. The announcement states 484 new sub-acute beds are coming but 395 of these are already in place, so in fact there are only 89. The Government is saying 1,500 new beds will be delivered as part of this winter plan, which extends until April. However, when we add it all up, there are only 528 new beds. Why is the Government announcing 1,500 beds? That is my first question.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Will the Minister break down where those beds are going? We need to know where the concentration of beds will be. We know we have extraordinary issues in the acute sector in the mid-west and in Cork University Hospital as well. We know where the problems are. We know wards in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin are closed because of Covid-19 outbreaks. There is a difference between what is being spun here versus what is the reality. I want the Minister to give assurances with regard to these figures that we will have capacity, because when Covid-19 goes into hospitals beds will disappear. The virus spreads and we do not want it to spread, so wards will close. Will the Minister give clarity on those figures immediately and break down where the beds will go?</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> There are ambitious plans for recruitment in health, with 12,500 staff to be recruited, including 5,000 before Christmas and 7,500 afterwards. Where will they come from? Ms Phil Ní Sheaghdha of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has pointed out that some nurses who came home from abroad have been unable to get full-time jobs. What will radically change? Will the Minister explain that to us? Where will we get the consultants we require? The Minister for Health is out on a limb on this. I have never seen a Minister commit to something so much. Will the Minister outline where all these staff will come from, how the Government will deliver this commitment and where these staff will be placed?</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Will the Minister tell us the position on the flu vaccine? Some 1.5 million people will get the flu vaccine. We know there is a delay and I accept there are issues internationally. However, we were pointing this out long before now. How will the vaccine get out in time before Christmas? How will we ensure that 1.5 million people, including vulnerable groups and categories, will be dealt with?</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> I will recap. Where are the beds and what are the beds? Where are the staff and where are they going? How will the flu vaccine be delivered before Christmas?</p>

          <p eId="para_211">The commitment of the Government to manage and get us through this health crisis is clear in the additional €2.5 billion spent so far. That will not be the end of it this year or next year. There will have to be major multibillion additional spending so that we can cope. To date, we have coped. It has been difficult and has involved serious stress on front-line workers and everyone else in the country as we have tried to suppress the virus and avoid going beyond the capacity of our health system. However, we have managed that to date. That is why in recent weeks the Government had to make a tough call by raising the level of restrictions in Dublin. Although the numbers are low, they are rising. That forced us to make that call.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> That is the primary issue in terms of managing through this winter period. I believe we can manage it. We have 11,000 beds in the system. Even though the numbers are rising, the number of Covid-19 beds is still relatively small. If we can see in Dublin and other parts of the country the same success that we saw in counties Kildare, Offaly and elsewhere in terms of stopping the increase in its tracks, we will manage our way through it. Part of that involves €600 million on top of the €2.5 billion spending already committed this year. This additional spending is to ensure we get through this critical winter period. My understanding is that this will provide a further 900 acute beds and 50 critical care beds. I am confident that the system, as it has shown in the past six months, will be able to be flexible and adapt as needs be, depending on what numbers are required in the bed capacity. The approach will include measures such as bringing private hospitals into the system, as needs be and if we need to do so, which we also did earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Critical to managing this will be maintaining the strategic direction of change that was agreed by the previous Dáil and committed to by this Government, namely, the development of Sláintecare. The critical point in our system, as we all know, is in the emergency wards and rooms in our hospitals. We should use what happened during Covid-19, that is, the emergence of the ability to use online and other systems and other new efficient ways of working, to take out some of those pinch-point bottlenecks. That will be the key measure. The HSE and the hospital system, in managing Covid-19, have shown exactly the flexibility we need to be able to manage our winter programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I will have to come back to Deputy Kelly with specifics on how exactly we will roll out the flu vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">That is a technical issue and I will have to come back to the Deputy with the mechanism for doing it. The key to it is this broader strategic approach to how we address Covid, implement Sláintecare and use the flexibility that has come in the Covid period to manage the winter period with these additional resources. I am confident that we can and will do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I mean no disrespect to the Minister but that is not an answer. He obviously does not have a clue. He does not know the data. This plan has been there for a couple of weeks. It has not been launched, for whatever reason, but he obviously does not know the data. There are 830 new acute beds, 63 critical care beds and 484 new sub-acute beds. Of that 830, 409 are in place; of the 63, 45 are in place; and of the 484, 395 are in place. The real figures, therefore, are 421, 45 and 89. That is information for the Minister from me, which he should have. Why is the Government saying this volume of beds are in place or are coming, when this is the reality? These are the figures that were broken down at the Government's press conference announcing this this morning, but the Minister does not know them here in the Dáil. I ask him, although I know he is not the Minister for Health, where these beds are going.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> The Minister for Health always talks about "the data". Can we get a breakdown of those who have been diagnosed with cancer, month by month, this year versus last year, so that we can see that we are dealing with the disease, which has impacted so much in our society, in the best way? The figures have not been published.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> My questions relate to the data on cancer figures and, most important, what the figures for the beds are, why the Government is announcing 1,500 beds and where they are going.</p>

          <p eId="para_224"> What I want to make clear is the strategic approach the Government is taking. It is the wider strategic approach that we, as members of the Government, have to consider. There is no shortage of support from the Government or of flexibility and effort if we find ourselves in a difficult winter period due to the Covid pandemic progressing in a direction we do not want, or to influenza, or to a recurrence of the problem of people on trolleys, which is a perennial problem every winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The key strategic point I want to make to the Deputy, which I believe is the important point, is that we will use the flexibility we learned during the Covid pandemic to make sure our health system removes some of the obstacles that exist there. That is not a data point but it is the key point in terms of how we improve our health service at this difficult time. We will use strategic decisions such as the development of online, eHealth systems that our system has developed in the Covid period to solve this problem. That is the emphasis we need to make and the important lesson we need to learn. It is what we now need to deliver.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">In the North, the opening of schools has been acknowledged as a key driver of a second wave of coronavirus cases. There is growing evidence in the South that the same is the case, as can be seen in the weekly case increases of people of schoolgoing age as a percentage of new cases. It has increased from a low of about 4% a week at the end of June to approximately 13% in recent weeks since schools have returned.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> Last Saturday, the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, decided to ballot teachers for industrial action. They have resorted to this because they are unsatisfied with the measures that have been taken to ensure their safety and the safety of students at school. We all know that the coronavirus seeks out vulnerabilities in individuals and attacks them mercilessly, but the same is true on a societal level. It has exposed the weaknesses in an underfunded health service in particular, but the same is also true in schools. We are paying the price for the lowest rate of investment in schools in the entire OECD. We are paying the price for a pupil-teacher ratio of 26:1, compared with an EU average of 20:1, and for circumstances in which one in four schools does not have running hot water. It is incredible that, in 2020, one in four schools is without hot water.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> One crucial, immediate issue is that of ventilation. We know now that airborne transmission is a key way in which the virus is spread. It is why indoor environments are particularly dangerous. A total of 84% of principals say their schools do not have adequate ventilation. Will the Government commit to rolling out a programme of retrofitting of ventilation in schools?</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> There is also an issue with the provision of information. Last week, the Dáil was cleared out while the Minister for Health was getting a test, but at a school in my constituency, someone tested positive and the teachers and the students who had worked side by side with the student were not even tested. It is mind-blowing. A quite outrageous story was reported a week and a half ago in Drogheda, where a teacher was notified by the Covid tracker app that they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive, but when the HSE found out they were a teacher, they were reportedly told that because they were a teacher, and because the transmission had happened in a school environment, they were no longer counted as a close contact. Why are teachers and students not being categorised as close contacts and tested in the same way as others?</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> Many other issues are raised in respect of safety at school. Teachers with underlying conditions and at high risk are still, despite the publicity around it and so on, being forced to go into school by a private company, Medmark. One of the cases was a teacher who has reported battling acute leukaemia, diabetes type 2, asthma, anaemia and an auto-immune disorder, and was told by Medmark they had to return to work. Will the Government give a commitment that no teachers who are high risk, and who are advised by their doctors not to work from school because they cannot safely do so, will be forced to attend work? The ballot by the ASTI is a warning to the Government. Is the Government going to heed it?</p>

          <p eId="para_231">The reopening of schools has been an important milestone for children and society. The safety and well-being of staff, students and the whole school community has been of paramount importance in the Government's planning for school reopening. The Department of Education and Skills has engaged extensively with stakeholders, including the ASTI, in developing the plans for reopening. Significant funding of more than €375 million was secured and given to schools to ensure the implementation of the Return to Work Safely Protocol and the recommendations of the public health authorities in providing a safe environment for the whole school community. The Department has continuing weekly engagement with the public health authorities so that schools can remain open safely, and is also working with stakeholders, including the ASTI, in this respect. Appropriate information and guidance for schools leaders has been provided by public health experts at the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills. Detailed information on the public health approach when there have been confirmed cases on a potential outbreak at a school has been published and issued to all schools. To date, where confirmed cases have arisen, schools have co-operated with public health experts to minimise further risk to the school community. Funding for any personal protective equipment, PPE, required has also been provided to schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> As for high-risk staff, an enhanced occupational healthcare service has been put in place. Very high-risk staff are permitted to work from home, and other staff in the normal and high-risk categories can return to the workplace provided that appropriate risk-mitigation measures are in place and implemented according to their school's Covid-19 response plan. This is in line with the approach being adopted in other areas of the public sector, including the health sector. A review process is being put in place where concerns remain and the Department will continue to engage with all education partners, including the ASTI, in the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">The point is that teachers are saying that enough has not been done, and that the conditions are not safe enough for teachers, students and the wider community. They do not want to be saying this; everybody wants schools to remain open, but if this issue is not dealt with, it is only a matter of time before there are school outbreaks, with classes and whole schools being sent home, causing chaos. Teachers are blowing the whistle on unsafe conditions that will mean chaos if they are not addressed. When meat plant workers blew the whistle on their working conditions, they were ignored and dismissed by the Government until it was too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Rather than ignore them this time around, I urge the Government to listen to what they are saying and take action. In a concrete way, we can take the example of the high risk teachers. The answer the Minister gave accepts the fact that people such as that teacher with multiple conditions such as acute leukemia, type 2 diabetes, asthma, anaemia and autoimmune disorder can be ordered by a private company to go back to work even though his or her own doctor says it is not safe to do so. That should be withdrawn. The advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, in the USA is that when community transmission is high, better control measures are needed in schools than when it is low. That is the case now and we need urgent action by the Government to address these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">In this and other areas the Government cedes to public health authorities because their expertise and advice point towards the best way of managing these matters for all concerned, including teachers, pupils and the wider public. That is where such issues have to be addressed and considered. The process includes a review and it is within that which I expect the Government will listen to the ASTI and others and make sure their concerns are addressed as best they can, subject to public health advice, which is the test that has to be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> On the investment in schools, be it in ventilation or in other mechanisms, my understanding of that funding of €375 million is that it was spent in a short period of time but that it was spent effectively. A lot of schools turned things around and did a remarkable job and it was often the school management and board, along with teachers and pupils, who were engaged with that. I understand that this funding allowed schools to put enhanced cleaning and hygiene arrangements in place, modify buildings and rooms to facilitate physical distancing, hire extra and replacement teachers and purchase PPE through a procurement framework. If there are gaps in that, I again suggest that the review process will allow those gaps to be filled. To date, there has been no reluctance from Government to fund the work that needed to be done to back up the public health advice with physical work on the ground to help protect all of the people involved.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Lowry<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_237">In recent months, we have heard impassioned pleas for assistance from almost every sector in the country. The Government, for the most part, has heard these pleas. Help has been provided that has gone some way towards easing the financial burdens of those most seriously impacted by Covid-19. While we remain in the increasing shadow of this virus, the new normal is unfolding as we find ways to operate within the restrictions and guidelines. The majority are being given some opportunity of survival to live alongside the virus. There is, however, a small but dynamic minority that remains firmly in the dark tunnel and is not seeing even a flicker of light on the horizon.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> The entertainment industry in Ireland is dying. It is gasping for help and support. This industry is as vital to our culture as all our historic landmarks and breathtaking scenery. It has been silenced for six months. We are not only talking about the big household names in the industry that can no longer tour the country. We are talking about the guy with his guitar who plays in the pubs over the weekends, the bands that play at weddings and parties, the DJs who work in pubs and nightclubs and the actors who perform in established venues. The list that falls under the realm of entertainment is vast and varied. It accounts for no less than 35,000 people who make their living from bringing joy and pleasure to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The music has stopped and the party is over for many in the business. Their work may have stopped but their lives continue. The younger generation of entertainer is crippled with debt, such as mortgage commitments, repayment of loans on expensive gear and sound systems, leased vehicles and a variety of other costs that cannot be met. The entertainers with dependant families and co-workers are emotionally wrecked and financially strapped. This group of talented people crave relief from the bondage of their ordeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Numerous festivals and events across Tipperary are also impacted as they have been cancelled, with a huge loss of vital revenue to local clubs, organisations and charities. The seriousness of the knock-on effects are evident in my home town of Thurles, where we have two successful event companies. Of these, one specialises in all things electrical and the other provides a complete on-site cleaning service. The management and employees of both companies have been hammered by the repercussions of restrictions on live events and they need help. They need immediate support that will enable them to survive for what could realistically be up to two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> It is somewhat ironic that our vibrant entertainment industry feels that its voice is not heard. As it stands, it will be the last sector to return to any form of normality. This fact must be recognised and reflected in next month's budget. The entertainment industry's demand for financial support must be heeded. Otherwise, it is facing its final curtain.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I agree with the Deputy. The music, entertainment, arts and cultural sectors are probably among the worst hit. The definition of their work is performance with an audience and that has meant they have not been able to operate. Some businesses have lost 80% and some have lost 30% but a lot of the performing sectors have lost 100% of their outlets, ability to work and livelihoods. It is not just their loss of livelihood but for us there is a loss of entertainment, inspiration, hope, culture and creativity in all of our lives. A price cannot be put on that but we all know it is a massive loss to us as a people.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> In recognising that, the Government has introduced a number of measures, initially on a test basis in the July stimulus to try to see what might work. There was a €1 million pilot music stimulus package for funding schemes that were designed in conjunction with the music industry to see how it might be possible to support music venues or genres in this difficult time. There is also a €5 million pilot - again it is a pilot to see what works and then we can scale it up - live performance support scheme, which the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht set up to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performance to provide employment to workers in the creative industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> Recognising that we need to go further, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Catherine Martin, has established a new task force for the recovery of the arts and cultural sector under the chairmanship of Ms Clare Duignan. The task force, which met for the first time this week, includes culture, the arts, the audiovisual industry and the live entertainment industry, with the events industry alliance having two representatives on the task force. It has critical work to do to answer the question of how we will get our arts and entertainment industries through the worst of the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> On the pandemic unemployment payment, the difficulty is whether we can do something specific. It is difficult to apply universal social welfare payments down to specific areas but the Government has set up a cross-departmental task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the views of all stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and cultural sectors. That will play a key role as part of the development of the national economic recovery plan, which will have to come after the budget and complement and work with whatever is done in the budget to get our entire economy through this difficult period, but specifically the sectors which are hardest hit.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> It is younger people and people in the entertainment, hospitality, arts and other sectors who are worst affected by this crisis and we need an economic recovery plan that specifically targets them in whatever way it can. I know my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is talking to all of the people in the sector to try to get that right and I know the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have similar views that this has to be the focus of our attentions. I commit to that for those in Tipperary and beyond.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I thank the Minister for his response and his acknowledgement of the needs of this sector. The approach required to help must be multifaceted. Helping the entertainment industry to survive will require what the industry itself is all about, namely creativity. Financial support is crucial to it at this time. Getting the industry itself back on its feet, and therefore less dependent on the financial supports that are in place, will be a significant challenge while the necessary restrictions remain in place. I am requesting that the Government recognises the needs that have been spelled out in submissions from both the National Campaign for the Arts and the event production industry. I request that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, who I accept has set up a task force, examine this issue and have that reflected in the budget. The situation of the industry needs urgent and meaningful responses in the forthcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Will the Minister have discussions with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his party colleague, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to find a way forward for the industry?</p>

          <p eId="para_249">I commit to doing that and I know my Government colleagues will give their full attention to this. I will give one message of possibility. We have had real difficulty in recent times with increasing numbers but in the establishment of the five-level framework, there was a clear understanding that even within level 2, we needed to start allowing audiences to come back in a safe and organised way, depending on the size of the venue or how controlled it could be. For large areas of the country, where we hope there will not be an increased level of virus transmission, there will be the possibility of starting to organise some events.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> This will have to be done under public health guidelines but the design of the levels, from my experience of the discussion on them, looked to try to give the capability of some events to return or performances to take place in a controlled environment with the proper social distancing. I have been to certain events in theatres or elsewhere and people are doing this. This industry is creative and highly capable, and it is keen to get back to work. We should start doing that. We should use the levels and, I hope, work collectively to get to lower levels of virus transmission.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> We are not at a point where no events can take place but the events must take place in a safe environment. The industry can and should work with that aim in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">Will the Government introduce the legislation that the Central Bank has called for in order to hold individual bankers to account in order that people could be jailed for the type of practices that have gone on over the past decade in this State?</p>

          <p eId="para_258">First, I acknowledge that the Deputy's statement is absolutely right. What those companies did was totally inappropriate, wrong and unforgivable. The bank in question has been fined €18.3 million because of how it dealt with 3,741 customers, and it has had to repay, to date, €153.5 million. Permanent TSB was previously fined €21 million because of how it treated tracker customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> As I have said, it is shocking that they wrongly took people off cheap loans and that this led to the loss of 11 family homes. Nobody would condone or accept that. The Government welcomes the actions of the Central Bank to hold KBC to account and compensate borrowers and it has committed to making mortgage lending in Ireland fair and transparent. The programme for Government commits to increasing the availability of long-term fixed rate mortgages, as well as examining the development of green mortgages and State-backed mortgages for first-time buyers. It also commits to examining the introduction of a code of conduct on mortgage switching.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">Students have been in touch with me, and, I would imagine, most Deputies in this House about accommodation. Planning for the year ahead, they face very difficult choices about whether they will need accommodation because lectures are moving online. In Dublin, there are additional restrictions for universities and third level institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> NUI Galway has confirmed that any student registered to stay in university-owned accommodation will now be entitled to a full refund if he or she decides not to go ahead with the booking because there is a less of a need to spend time on campus. This needs to happen across the board and every third level institution must say the same to students who are potentially booking or have booked accommodation. Otherwise, there will be a rip-off.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Will the Government ensure the appropriate Minister will communicate to all third level institutions that they must do the same as NUI Galway and ensure third level students do not have to pay for accommodation that they will not use?</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I agree with the Deputy and when colleges have accommodation, particularly when it is under their control, it should be an asset for the student body and not a revenue source. It must be part of the flexible solutions that must apply in how third level institutions are managed in this time. Where colleges have accommodation, they have been requested to try to show flexibility in its use. Several of them are doing so and others are constrained by students having already booked accommodation. It would be desirable for private operators to show the same flexibility but it is not within the remit of the Department to issue an instruction for the market. I agree that where colleges can do so, we should be showing flexibility and that must be part of an overall solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">I am aware of the legislation and I spoke to the Deputy about it last week. It has not been discussed at Cabinet and I have not yet discussed it with my party. My understanding, and certainly with my party, is that such flexibility or such an approach is a real possibility. It is not the norm in this House but where there are matters of complex conscience and very different views, that tends to be a possibility. I certainly would not rule it out. Following discussion in my party we will revert on our approach. As I said, it has not yet been discussed by the Government and each party would really have to speak for itself in tune with the approach suggested by the Deputy, that this is not something on which we would divide on party political grounds.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">Mary Bartley Meehan lost her son and husband to Covid-19 in Kilbrew nursing home within six weeks of each other. She was recently shown a video of her husband before he died. The side of Ultan's face was discoloured with black, congealed blood. His nails were long and black as he had, unknown to himself, been picking his facial tumours and, as a result, his face had become infected. Shockingly, his face was infested with maggots.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Months after this happened, Mary has sought an investigation by asking the Minister for Health, the Department of Health, the HSE and HIQA for one. All have refused such an investigation. My colleague, Councillor Emer Tóibín in Meath, wrote to the Ombudsman and asked his office to investigate. He sent a letter in reply today, indicating that he has once again raised this issue of extending the remit of his office to include clinical judgment. He states the vast majority of cases relating to the healthcare sector involve some element of clinical judgment. He states it is a matter of frustration to him that complaints like these cannot be addressed by his office.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Will the Minister guarantee that somebody will take responsibility for this and carries out an investigation? Will the Government look to extend the remit of the Ombudsman?</p>

          <p eId="para_276">The Minister has outlined his disgust at what KBC Bank Ireland has done in robbing and stealing from its customers. Tens of thousands of business owners, including musicians, contractors, taxi drivers and bus operators, are waiting anxiously to see if the banks will extend the repayment moratorium, which will run out in a couple of days. The Minister told a Deputy earlier that the Minister for Finance would be meeting with representatives of the banks next Tuesday. Why put people through this misery during the Covid-19 pandemic? The banks must be dragged kicking and screaming all the time to act instead of being up front with and half decent to their customers and giving them peace of mind. These customers are hanging on by their fingernails trying to provide for their families and their employees. It is shocking. The banks in this country act like it is the Wild West. They do not respect any business or any customer's length of time doing business with them. Surely the Government can decide that the banks must offer a moratorium and deal with people sensitively during this time of need.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">My understanding is that the Minister for Finance is meeting representatives of the banks on Monday. The timelines here are set by the European Banking Authority rather than by anything the Government has done. As I said earlier during Leaders' Questions, this was not a statement that there could not be further payment breaks. I encourage the banks and the customers to come together to decide on the appropriate mechanisms to get customers who are in difficulty through this crisis, including the extension or continuation of payment breaks. Those who are in difficulty and feel they will need them should act now, before 30 September, to try to secure the best arrangements for them. This has to be done on a case-by-case basis. That advice and message should go out to any constituents who are in that position.</p>

Does he think it is fair that utility companies such as Electric Ireland are incentivising people to go online to pay their bills? People are being asked for a deposit of €300 if they wish to continue paying at their post office. I am really concerned about the impact this will have on post offices. Has the Government examined the impact this will have on the operation of post offices?</p>

          <p eId="para_279">As it happens, that question touches on two sections in my Department. I will be honest, in that I think the future of An Post is in the development of a range of new business applications. We are seeing it happening already. An Post is operating as a parcel delivery company and a financial support company for energy refits. The company is increasingly delivering Government services through its network. An Post has turned around in the past two or three years and is expanding into new areas. There will still be a mail system. We have a universal service obligation and it is a critical service. For many people a return to mail may be an appropriate and desirable way of communicating. It is appropriate for those energy companies to offer choice to customers or to favour moving services online in order to reduce their costs and thereby the costs to consumers. I do not see the two concerns as connected.</p>

This area includes Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Wexford and Waterford and has a population of more than 400,000 people. This is unacceptable.

          <p eId="para_284">Some 12,000 people in Ireland suffer from Parkinson's disease. Each and every one of them lives with the disease without much State assistance. Local county-level Parkinson's groups have operated in Ireland for many years. In Cork, one of these has been making the lives of Parkinson's sufferers somewhat easier. It raises funds locally for research and equipment for patients and last year purchased a minibus to take Parkinson's sufferers to events. This group keeps people with Parkinson's together so they can share information to help each other through a very difficult time in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> The umbrella group, Parkinson's Association of Ireland, has experienced numerous changes in the past 12 months, many of which are affecting its branches on the ground. The association has sent strongly worded emails to the heads of local branches at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. I ask the Minister to bear in mind that these branch heads suffer with Parkinson's disease themselves. This is worrying and upsetting members. </p>
          <p eId="para_286"> I ask the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to step in with the association to end any concern on the part of the local branches before its AGM on 10 October.

          <p eId="para_288">As the Minister will be aware, we in County Cavan do not have any rail line and do not have any east-west link as yet, though I am still hopeful. We are totally dependent on our road network. Some 70% of our population lives in rural areas. Our county sees very intensive rural commercial activity, leading to very high volumes of heavy goods vehicles on the local road network. There are very poor drainage conditions and, therefore, our roads are structurally weak. Page 9 of the programme for Government features a commitment to essential road maintenance and upkeep. Will the Minister commit to increasing the depleted allocation from his Department, which currently stands at €15 million? That must be restored to the €20 million allocation of ten years ago. At most, that will only allow us to protect County Cavan's regional and local roads. We need more funding to be allocated to Cavan County Council to protect what we have.</p>

          <p eId="para_290">The challenge we have is that we need to fund investment in both public transport and the road network. Areas where there is no public transport alternative, as Deputy Niamh Smyth pointed out, must take precedence within the roads maintenance budget, which is not extensive. Road maintenance will also help bus services, which can be part of the public transport solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I am very aware of the lack of co-ordination in the provision of services to allow for the most beneficial use of the Tipperary rail lines. I do not know if Deputy Martin Browne is aware, but earlier during oral questions, we had a debate on the potential for development of rail freight services, which are completely contracted. If that happens, and it is a real strategic possibility, it might help us to make some of the necessary investments, particularly in those lines without significant passenger numbers. In that way, we could improve passenger services at the same time on lines in County Tipperary, for example.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">Bus Éireann has agreed to carry out a review of the school bus service in order to comply with the 50% capacity ruling. It was expected that it would take five or six weeks and that additional buses would be provided to resolve the dreadful situation in which many families who do not have access to buses find themselves, as well as assisting beleaguered private bus operators. We now hear from Bus Éireann that the review may take up to 12 weeks, which would bring us up to Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Many balls have been dropped by Bus Éireann throughout this process. I am aware of numerous children with special needs who, four weeks into the school term, still have not been able to attend school because Bus Éireann has not finalised the provision of transport for them. I acknowledge it will take money to sort out this crisis but the reality is that money invested will trickle down to private operators if Bus Éireann can get its act together. It is a semi-State company and it is important that, as such, it steps up to the plate at a time of national crisis. It receives more than €40 million in State subvention each year. Its handling of this crisis thus far has been disgraceful.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">The school bus transport problems in rural Ireland are diabolical. Constituents based in various parts of the country have contacted me because they cannot go to work, as they must bring their children to school. Many other people have been keeping their children home from school because there is no school bus available. There was a lack of organisation to deal with the problems caused by Covid. Initially, people could not get tickets. When they did get tickets, there was no space for them on the bus. They were then told the rules had changed. This is a crisis affecting ordinary families who are doing their best. There were problems before Covid and those problems have multiplied. An effort needs to be made to step up to the mark and recognise that families with schoolgoing children in all parts of the country, not just in urban areas, have a right to a school transport system.</p>

My understanding is that the Department of Education and Skills will be coming to the Government within a much shorter timeframe with a review of the further changes we need to make to the public school transport system in response to the health advice. The system Bus Éireann and the Department set up in very difficult circumstances responded effectively and in a timely manner, with procedures and mechanisms to ensure children would be safe on buses as well as in their schools. Due to the unfortunate spike in numbers in the second half of August and early September, which no one could control or manage, further health advice provided a short time before schools were due to return stated that further spacing should be catered for in order to follow public health advice to the letter. The Government made a decision to proceed with the plans that had been put in place because it was critical to get children back to school. That was the right decision. It was critical that children returned to school. There are and have been real difficulties, as all Members acknowledge. There are always difficulties with regard to the school transport system, such as schoolchildren not having the relevant concession. The Government agreed to see whether it could contract several hundred additional buses in order to meet the further health advice. That is what the Department of Education and Skills is now doing. I expect it to revert to the Government on the matter in the not too distant future and the House will be updated on that basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I am seated behind the Minister. I have his back. There are many vulnerable groups in society, but I wish to raise the plight of a particularly vulnerable small group, namely, expectant mothers. This issue has been raised previously in the House. Like many other Deputies, I have begun to receive an increased volume of correspondence from expectant mothers. As the Minister is aware, they are not allowed to be accompanied by their partners or spouses during labour, which is particularly isolating, lonely and distressing. In addition, they are not allowed to be accompanied by their spouses or partners when attending any pregnancy-related appointment. I recently received correspondence from a young woman who was one of just two expectant mothers in a waiting room capable of holding up to 100 people. Her husband had to wait for her in their car for up to five hours. I ask the Minister to explain the rationale behind these rules and to outline whether there is any hope of them being relaxed somewhat in the context of public health.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">As I have stated several times during Leaders' Questions and Questions on Promised Legislation, the Government tends to follow public health advice because it is a good north star to follow in these times. However, one sometimes wonders what the rationale for particular decisions is. In the instance cited by the Deputy, I tend to agree with him. The restrictions to which he referred are a remarkable imposition on and difficulty for expectant parents. Anyone who has been in that position knows that being present when one's child is born or when a scan comes through for the first time is one of the most important moments in one's life. I believe the restrictions are applied on a case-by-case basis. Different hospitals are applying different rules. My personal view is that it would be far better and more appropriate to allow partners to be present for those particular moments, as much for the resultant health benefits as for anything else.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">I was contacted yesterday by a parent whose daughter was about to start college at UCD. Her timetable indicates that she will attend on campus for three days between now and January, yet the university is seeking full payment for her on-campus accommodation. The student and her parent have been told that they must pay up by this evening or her place will be cancelled. I acknowledge that the Minister stated there would be intervention on this matter, but I ask that the intervention by the Minister with responsibility for this area, Deputy Harris, whom I have contacted on this matter, be made today. Parents and students are under significant pressure after what has already been a very difficult year. We cannot have a situation where universities and colleges are charging full accommodation costs when students simply will not be on campus between now and January. Indeed, they may not be on campus for the rest of the academic year.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">As I stated, the Government is asking colleges and universities to show flexibility, particularly where they have control of the accommodation. The impact of the pandemic on college life must be a great disappointment, particularly for those who are starting college this autumn. For those who are lucky enough to attend third level, it is an incredible time when one meets new friends who often turn out to be friends for life and when one begins learning in a new way. I hope that we can bring our numbers back to stability in a very quick timeframe. It is not about getting the numbers right down to the point of suppression. Rather, the public health ambition and goal is about stabilising the numbers such that we are not facing a doubling of cases every ten days. If that is done and the incidence of Covid in Dublin and other counties drops to a lower level, it may be possible for colleges and universities to introduce elements of face-to-face learning, as well as the other important part of college life, namely, interaction with one's peers and lecturers in a way that is not all online.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">The section of the programme for Government that deals with education states that teachers and pupils are at the heart of the education system. Earlier this week, I visited Edmund Rice College in Blanchardstown. It has been waiting for a new school building for five years. It has now been told that the earliest it will be delivered will be February 2022. The reality is that construction takes far longer than that and the school believes the building will be delivered later that year, possibly in September 2022. If the Government can fast-track co-living developments, strategic housing developments, strategic infrastructure and prisons, why can it not fast-track schools? Why does it take so long for schools to be built? I appeal for the Government to look at the legislation and figure out whether we can get schools delivered quickly because there is serious pressure in Dublin 15 in the context of school places.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">It is my understanding that the Department of Education and Skills was standardising the process and has a staged process that aims to smooth out the difficulties in order that schools are built quickly. If the Deputy provides me with details of the case in question, I will forward them to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, and ask her to identify the best possible timeline for the delivery of the school.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">The programme for Government outlines that the Government wishes to establish a national medicines agency to set a fair price for drug reimbursement. I can tell the Minister that that process is not working. I am aware of applications for drug reimbursement which would save the State millions but which are not being approved because headline discounts of up to 50% are required. No cost-benefit analysis is being conducted with regard to the possible future impact on patients. I ask the Government to give consideration to that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> The programme for Government commits to the provision of a catheterisation laboratory in Waterford. Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach why there is a four-month procurement process to approve an approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The funding has been ring-fenced for almost 18 months and yet we are talking about entering a four-month procurement process on a project that should have started.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Can I also confirm that yesterday, in the House, the Taoiseach advised that there was diagnostic angiogram activity going on through a service-level agreement, SLA, in Waterford with the Whitfield Hospital? That is not the case. We have been delaying 30 diagnostic angiograms a week at University Hospital Waterford since February. I ask that the Government review this.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">On the Waterford cath lab, which is critically important for the region, it was unfortunate that there were delays due to Covid-19 but it is intended that the project will now go to tender. The HSE advises that funding was allocated in the 2019 capital plan, as the Deputy said. The fire certificate was granted in June of this year. The disability access certificate was granted in April of this year. Preparation of contract documentation has commenced and the contract selection is complete subject to a cooling off period. As to why there is that four-month period, it is deeply frustrating in our State and, unfortunately, I have seen it in so many different areas. I suppose the only, best and honest answer is we conduct procurement to the dotting of i's and crossing of t's properly so that there is never any question and that it is safe from any legal challenge.</p>

The culture of banking needs to change in this country. While my party welcomes the €18.3 million fine issued by the Central Bank today, it does not change anything in terms of holding individual bankers to account for their actions. Corporations do not make decisions; individuals do. Two years ago, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, promised to introduce a new senior executive accountability regime. The Minister has failed to do that. Can the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, inform the House as to when that new regime will be in place?</p>

There has been a range of instances dating right back where lax standards in character, culture and tolerance of failings have bedevilled Irish banking and that needs to change. I am not aware of what the Minister, Deputy Donohoe's proposals were with regard to monitoring and policing standards in that area but white-collar crime cannot pay. We must make sure that such crime is seen to be treated in the same way as if someone was robbing in a different way. I do not have the particular legislative measure but I will try to find out and respond.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_332">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to restore the eligibility of all persons born in the island of Ireland to Irish citizenship, to extend the eligibility for Irish citizenship to children resident for a period of time in the island of Ireland and related matters, to enhance the eligibility for Irish citizenship for children resident in the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Citizenship for Children) Bill 2020 has two purposes: to restore automatic citizenship for all children born on the island of Ireland; and to provide citizenship for children residing here for three years or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> It is fair to say that the decision to move this Bill at such a relatively early stage in this Parliament has been inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> The Bill will reverse the legislation enacted in 2005 on foot of the 2004 citizenship referendum, which was, in my opinion, a racist referendum, and it aims to provide security of rights for thousands of young people growing up in this country undocumented. The 2004 referendum removed automatic birth right for citizenship for young people born on this island if they did not have parents coming from the EU or a small number of other European countries. It has impacted the lives of thousands of young people, not least the hundreds of young people who have been deported from this country since that time or who face deportation today.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> It is particularly apt that the Bill is being moved at this time because a young person who was born around the time that legislation was enacted is approaching his or her 16th birthday now and is facing into the denial of freedoms and rights that peers, friends and classmates enjoy. Let me give the House a couple of examples from some recent parliamentary questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> I wrote to the Tánaiste to ask if measures would be put in place to ensure that persons born here post 2005 and who were not Irish, UK, EEA or Swiss nationals would not need to apply for work permits or other organisations to work here. In his reply, the Tánaiste stated that, in order to work in the State, all non-EEA citizens required a valid employment permit or relevant immigration permission issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Therefore, young people born in this country face the prospect of having to apply for work permits in order to work in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> I asked the Minister, Deputy Harris, if measures would be put in place to ensure that students who were born here and who had been long-term resident in Ireland but were not Irish, UK, EEA or Swiss citizens would be able to avail of the free fees scheme and apply for SUSI grants. In his reply, the Minister said that, to qualify for a student grant, it was the candidate's nationality or his or her immigration status in the State that determined whether he or she met the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and regulations, and went on to say that, where students did not qualify for free fees funding, they must pay the appropriate fee. In other words, young people born in this country or who grew up in this country face the prospect of having to pay exorbitant fees to go to college and, in effect, of being locked out of third level education. This is a scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> If the Black Lives Matter movement showed anything, it showed that the children of immigrants are not prepared to accept this discrimination, they want equality and they want the removal of obstacles to a decent life.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">This is summed up by some of the things that were said around that movement. Tamilore Awonusi observed that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_341">During the recent discourse, the “Ireland isn’t racist” rhetoric has made me uncomfortable. Could it be that this “norm” is so embedded in our culture to the point that we’re oblivious to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Erica Cody stated: "We’ve endured so much and Irish people of colour are ready to tell their stories and ready to be heard," and that "this is not going to go away and people are ready for change worldwide." We are attempting to bring the mood on the streets into this Parliament with a clear message summed up in this Bill that the time for discrimination is gone and the time for equality is now. </p>

          <p eId="para_347">I am grateful for the opportunity to update the House on developments in recent months with respect to Brexit. As I have said previously in this House, despite the continued focus of the Government, and the country, on the unprecedented challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, Brexit also poses an unprecedented challenge for Ireland. The Government’s focus and strategy, with regard to the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, the future of the relationship between the EU and the UK and the future of our bilateral relationship with the UK, has not wavered. </p>
          <p eId="para_348"> In the past two weeks, there has been much attention on the publication of the UK Government's Internal Market Bill. Its publication caused grave concern, as I will discuss in more detail later. Time is short now, as we all know, and serious issues remain outstanding. Despite noise, and despite setbacks, this Government’s focus remains on the implementation, in full and in good faith, of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol, and on achieving a successful conclusion to the future relationship negotiations. </p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I will now seek to address in more detail the state of play with regard to EU-UK negotiations, implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the Government’s discussions with UK and EU interlocutors in recent days, the readiness in Ireland for the end of the transition, and Ireland’s bilateral relationship with the UK, on which we must always focus. </p>
          <p eId="para_350"> On negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship, the EU has been engaged in intensive negotiations with the UK over recent months to try to agree a broad and comprehensive future partnership agreement. This remains the goal. Ireland supports the closest possible relationship between the EU and UK. However, what can be achieved will also be determined by the scope of the UK’s ambition in this area and its willingness to engage seriously with the EU's red lines. We want an agreement, but it must be one that respects the EU's long-term economic interests. </p>
          <p eId="para_351"> Eight formal negotiating rounds have now taken place, with additional informal contacts between the chief negotiators and their teams outside the formal setting. These talks continue to address a broad range of issues, from trade in goods and services to transport and energy, from law enforcement to mobility, and so on. The ninth round is due to take place next week. Unfortunately, nowhere near sufficient progress has been made. </p>
          <p eId="para_352"> Significant gaps remain on key issues, in particular on the level playing field, governance and fisheries. These fundamental issues must be addressed to secure an overall agreement. As set out in the political declaration agreed in October of last year, the EU-UK future relationship must encompass "robust commitments to prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages". We want this commitment followed through. Level playing field provisions must reflect the proximity and depth of the trading relationship between the EU and the UK. These are necessary to protect fair and open competition and to prevent diverging standards in areas such as environmental protections and workers' rights</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> State aid is a key consideration in the EU-UK future relationship talks. The political declaration agreed by the EU and UK clearly sets out state aid as one of the critical areas to ensure a level playing field and open and fair competition between both parties. Progress on fisheries has also been disappointing so far. The original intention was to resolve the area of fisheries by midsummer. Fisheries is an important priority for Ireland. We are seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in terms of both access and the quota share it currently enjoys in British waters. From the outset of the negotiations, Ireland and our EU partners have been clear on our level of ambition in this area and on the fact that progress on an overall trade deal is linked to progress on fisheries. This is reflected in the EU mandate and the draft EU legal text. The two sides are still very far apart, however. The task force is continuing to push for increased UK engagement on this area, and affected member states, including Ireland, are continuing our very close engagement with the task force on the EU approach. I spent some time speaking to Michel Barnier on this issue this week. </p>
          <p eId="para_354"> The next negotiating round will begin next week, on 28 September. Time is growing very short, but we should not forget that it is in everyone’s interests for a deal to be reached. Michel Barnier and his team have done enormous work representing the interests of all member states. They have our full and unequivocal support. For our part, Ireland will continue to work as part of the EU 27 to ensure that our collective approach to these negotiations reflects our values and interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> The withdrawal agreement, of which the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is an integral part, was agreed by the EU and the UK, just less than one year ago, in October 2019. It was approved by all EU Heads of Government and received the assent of the European Parliament. It was signed and ratified by the UK Government. Legislation implementing it was passed by the UK Parliament at the beginning of this year. It is a legally binding international agreement. </p>
          <p eId="para_356"> From the beginning, Ireland's approach has been guided by the principle of securing a deal that worked for Northern Ireland and the island as a whole. The protocol includes provisions that avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, that recognise the common travel area, protect continued North-South co-operation and protect the integrity of the Single Market and, as important, Ireland's place in it. </p>
          <p eId="para_357">It also affirms that Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the UK and its place in the UK's internal market. It maintains commitments to ensure no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It maintains the single electricity market and reaffirms the commitment of the EU and the UK to the PEACE PLUS programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The protocol is designed to operate in all circumstances, including the absence of an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK. Some commentators forget that. The negotiation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol was lengthy and detailed and the protocol represents a fair and balanced outcome for all parties, with compromises on all sides. It is specifically designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> Clarity on and stability in all aspects of the protocol are vital for businesses and people in Northern Ireland. The protocol allows them to be fully assured that the peace and prosperity delivered through the Good Friday Agreement will be protected in all circumstances. A vital component of this is protection of the all-island economy, which is important to businesses across the island of Ireland, now perhaps even more than ever. We have always been clear on the need for the protocol to work for the people of Northern Ireland and for the business community there. Throughout the Brexit process, I have maintained close contacts with leaders in Northern Ireland, including contacts today and yesterday. I have also continued to engage intensively with its farming and business representatives and other key stakeholders. I recognise the importance of east-west trade for Northern Ireland businesses. I welcome that the EU is already engaging closely with the UK to find appropriate and agreed solutions, but they must fall within the framework of the agreed protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> The withdrawal agreement affirms in black and white the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. This is set out in the very first operative article of the protocol. It is vital that the protocol be implemented now in full and in good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> The UK published the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill on Wednesday, 9 September. The British Government's approach in this legislation is deeply concerning. The Bill, if it were implemented in its current form, would undermine the withdrawal agreement and the certainty and stability that is so vital to protecting the Good Friday Agreement. It would seriously erode and damage trust in Northern Ireland and between the EU and the UK. Injecting uncertainty and confusion at this point of the process is not helpful on any level.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The Taoiseach raised our concerns directly with the British Prime Minister on the day the Bill was published. He also discussed these issues with the EU's chief negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, and Commission President von der Leyen. We raised the same points during the extraordinary meeting of the joint committee on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, which met on Thursday, 10 September. At that meeting, Commission Vice President Šefcovic urged the British Government to remove the problematic measures from the Bill by the end of this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I attended the General Affairs Council in Brussels on Tuesday of this week, where the state of play on Brexit was discussed and the full unity of the EU in support of Mr. Barnier, our chief negotiator, was expressed strongly. I also had a range of meetings and contacts while there on Brexit-related issues. I met Vice President Šefcovic, the co-chair of the EU-UK joint committee, and Mr. Barnier. We agreed that our collective focus should continue to be on achieving a successful conclusion to the future relationship negotiations and continued engagement through the mechanisms provided for under the withdrawal agreement to resolve outstanding issues. Let us see what progress can be made in the coming short weeks, but in any final trade deal, we will have to be clear and fully certain that the withdrawal agreement will be implemented in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Even if we get an agreement on a future relationship, I do not believe it will be ratified if there is still a threat by the UK to legislate to undermine the withdrawal agreement and break international law. Why would the EU ratify a new agreement with a country that is threatening to break an agreement that is not even 12 months old? As with everything in politics, trust and relationships are what matter in this context. I continue to try to remind the British Government in particular that, when all of this is done and we are on the other side of the transition at the end of this year, the relationship between the EU and the UK will be important for many of the global challenges that we face together and many of the mutual interests that we have and on which we need partnership. As we try to close out a future relationship agreement that puts in place a basic trade agreement and makes the end of the transition as acceptable and implementable as possible in terms of the change and disruption that are coming, we must bear in mind that, after all of this, the relationships between the EU and the UK need to be protected so that, for many reasons, we remain close in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> The next meeting of the joint committee will take place on 28 September and Ireland will participate as part of the EU delegation, as always.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> As Members of the House know, we have urged the British Government to step back from its deeply concerning approach in terms of legislation and to work to repair the trust that has been damaged and implement successfully and faithfully the withdrawal agreement and protocol that we agreed together. A positive resolution to this issue is in all of our interests in the short and medium terms. We remain in close contact with all of our EU and UK colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> This Tuesday marked 100 days until the end of the transition period on 31 December. Irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing EU-UK negotiations, there will be substantial and lasting change for citizens and businesses from that date. The Irish Government has been planning for Brexit since the UK's referendum. We had made significant progress as we faced no-deal cliff edges in March and October 2019 and again in January 2020. While this earlier work stood to us as we moved into the transition period, we were also conscious that the end of the transition period was a different proposition from a no-deal scenario. It was necessary to recalibrate our work to address the immediate challenges and the long-term permanent changes that would arise on 1 January. As with every other sector of the economy, we had to do this while responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Ireland has always supported the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, but the limited progress we are seeing in the negotiations requires us to plan for a less ambitious outcome than that. In May, the Government agreed to intensify its readiness planning on the basis of two possible scenarios: a limited free trade agreement with a fisheries agreement and with level playing field and governance arrangements intact; and a hard Brexit with the EU and UK trading on WTO terms after being unable to agree a future relationship and trade deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> In the first scenario, the EU and UK would agree a limited free trade agreement with level playing field provisions, providing for zero tariffs and zero quotas, and finalise a fisheries agreement in parallel. This outcome would bring substantial challenges for supply chains and trade flows and would require checks and controls in both directions on EU-UK trade. In practice, this will mean that every time Irish companies or individuals import from or export to Great Britain, they will need at least to complete a customs declaration. A limited free trade agreement would not address the full range of the EU's relations with the UK. Far from it, unfortunately.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> In the second scenario, if the EU and UK fail to reach an agreement, we will be faced with a hard Brexit and an immediate and disorderly change in the way the EU and UK trade and engage with each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">In such a scenario, from 1 January 2021, the EU and UK will trade on WTO rules. In addition to the implications for traders in terms of the added administrative burden, this outcome will also see the introduction of tariffs and quotas on trade, in both directions, with significant impacts on Irish trade. The effects of this will be particularly acute in the agrifood sector, where we could see an estimated tariff cost in the region of €1.35 billion to €1.5 billion per year. When one considers that we export some €5.5 billion worth of food and drink to the UK each year and import some €4.5 billion worth of food and drink from there, one sees just how significant that tariff would be in term of the cost competitiveness of that market for Irish products, particularly dairy products and beef. Either scenario will be highly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications, first and foremost for the UK but also bringing significant and lasting impacts for Ireland and the rest of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> The Government published its Brexit readiness action plan on 9 September. The plan focuses on preparing for the change we know will arise at the end of the transition period. For each challenge arising, the action plan sets out the concrete actions Government, business and individuals must take now to address the changes and mitigate the risks that will arise regardless of the outcome of the negotiations between the EU and the UK in the weeks ahead. While Brexit will bring many changes, one of the greatest will be that, from 1 January 2021, the UK will no longer be part of the EU's Single Market or customs union. This will happen regardless of the outcome of the negotiations. Any businesses that move goods from, to or through Great Britain need to be ready for the range of new procedures and paperwork that simply do not apply today to such trade. These include customs, VAT and excise duties and rules of origin requirements. These processes have consequent cash flow implications and logistics considerations. Consideration needs to be given to certifications, authorisations and accreditations as well as specific issues relating to importing or exporting animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> Every business owner who trades with Great Britain, no matter how small the operation, needs to understand the impacts any new rules or processes will have on his or her operations and supply chains Failure to implement these new requirements will prevent businesses from trading with the UK or could lead to significant delays in moving goods. It is important to note that these changes will not apply to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland will apply from the end of the transition period, ensuring Northern Ireland will have full access to the EU Single Market in goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The Brexit readiness action plan is the platform from which we will deliver concrete supports to businesses and citizens in the coming weeks. We are taking this work forward in three distinct but overlapping streams. The first involves work on which the Government can lead directly, such as infrastructure at ports and airports, introducing new legislation, which will come before the House in the coming weeks, and engaging with the European Commission on contingency planning and much else. The second concerns communicating with and supporting sectors and businesses most directly impacted. We are doing that every day. The third stream will involve helping to prepare for wider societal and citizen-focused impacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Supporting supply chains and trade flows remains a key priority. We are carrying out this work with the twin aim of ensuring trade can flow as smoothly as possible while also maintaining food safety and public health. The infrastructure required at Dublin Airport is now in place, while work continues at Dublin Port and at Rosslare. We will certainly be ready on 1 January for the challenges that lie ahead. Provision has been made to facilitate the deployment of some 1,000 staff to ensure compliance with import and export customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, regulations. The capacity of ICT systems has been significantly increased to deal with the expected growth in transactions post Brexit. Revenue estimates that as many as 20 million declarations could be lodged per annum, compared with a current figure of some 1.7 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Ensuring the efficient and effective functioning of the UK land bridge is also a key priority. Ireland has been working closely with our EU partners and the European Commission to ensure Irish and EU traders can continue to use this vital route between Ireland and the rest of the Single Market. The UK has acceded to the Convention on Common Transit, which is an important facilitating step. However, new procedures will apply. These will include a requirement for new paperwork as well as the need for each consignment to have a financial guarantee in place to cover the potential customs duties and other taxes at risk during the movement. Traders and hauliers will have to prepare for these changes if they wish to continue to use the land bridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> We must expect delays at key ports immediately after the end of the transition period. The Dover-Calais route has been identified as a particularly likely bottleneck. That was confirmed yesterday in the House of Commons by what Michael Gove had to say. Of course, goods that are moved directly between Ireland and elsewhere in the EU will not be subject to any of these new procedures. Traders moving across the UK land bridge might consider direct maritime services as an alternative route to market, particularly in the short term. Operators have indicated that capacity is available on direct routes. I encourage early engagement between all parties, including traders, hauliers and ferry companies, to discuss needs and options. The Government will be part of that discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> We have put in place a range of financial supports such as the Brexit loan scheme and the future growth loan scheme. We will all hear a lot of marketing and advertising information on radio and elsewhere in regard to these supports. As part of the July jobs stimulus, we rolled out the €20 million ready for customs package. This allows businesses to claim grants of up to €9,000 per employee hired or redeployed to a dedicated customs role. Skillnet Ireland's free customs training programme, Clear Customs Online 2020, is open for applications. Both these programmes are a response to a need identified by the business sector. We continue to provide upskilling and advisory supports through Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, LEOs. A wide range of webinars are being hosted by Departments and agencies for affected sectors. Revenue has written to 90,000 businesses to advise them on the steps required and has followed up with 14,000 telephone calls to provide further advice. We continue to host a range of sectoral stakeholder events for the transport, retail, construction and agrifood sectors, among others. As Minister, I chair the Brexit stakeholder forum, which brings together a number of business and NGO groups as well as political parties. At the last couple of meetings, the Opposition parties were not represented. I understand why that is the case in the current Covid environment but it would be good to have their input at the upcoming meetings. Such engagement contributes significantly to a sense of togetherness in respect of the political effort. Further targeted measures to support business and affected sectors to prepare and adapt will be considered in the context of budget 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> The Government is also working to pursue supports at EU level. I met Commissioner Hahn in Brussels earlier this week to discuss the special Brexit adjustment reserve, which provides funding of up to €5 billion aimed at countering the adverse consequences of Brexit in the member states and sectors worst affected by it. I highlighted to the Commissioner that economic studies have consistently shown that Ireland and, in particular, certain sectors of the Irish economy will be disproportionately affected by Brexit. We will continue to engage with the Commission as its thinking on the reserve develops in the weeks ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> To underpin the required readiness measures at the end of the transition period, further legislation is required. On 29 May, the Government approved the preparation of a scheme for a new Brexit omnibus Bill. Some Deputies will remember the previous Bill we introduced. The overarching aim of this legislation is to address the wide range of issues that could arise post transition, seek to protect citizens and consumers, facilitate the functioning of key sectors and ensure our businesses are not disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Bill will also support aspects of the common travel area and North-South co-operation. I expect to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas later in the autumn, probably in three weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The launch of the readiness action plan is accompanied by a whole-of-government communications campaign under the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready banner. The campaign includes advertisements in national and local media, social media outreach and direct outreach by Ministers to stakeholders. I would welcome the assistance of Members in getting the key messages out to their networks to reinforce the message that action is required now to address the profound and immediate changes that are on the way. The Government will assist Oireachtas Members in playing any supportive part in giving information and timelines around what we want to do, including any technical assistance that Members may want.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> It is fundamentally important for Ireland, and in our interests, to work to maintain a strong and constructive bilateral relationship with the UK. We want to strengthen this relationship, which is one between neighbours, trading partners and co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement. Our bilateral trade with Britain is worth over €1 billion per week and our people-to-people relationships are close to being unique in international terms. Close co-operation into the future remains clearly in the interest of all our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> Just as the future shape of the relationship between the UK and the EU will be decided in the coming months, we need to continue to develop Ireland’s bilateral engagement with the UK now that they are outside the EU. We need to develop a new framework for British-Irish engagement for the coming years. A new framework may include developing structures for regular meetings at heads of Government, ministerial and senior official levels. It will be important to enhance the role of the British-Irish Council and British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Working through these institutions will help to ensure that our interests are protected and advanced. In this regard, the continued effective operation of the common travel area and the safeguarding of reciprocal rights in social protection, education and healthcare will remain high on the agenda. Ongoing contact across Government with the UK on our responses to Covid-19 will continue to be essential over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> We are investing in the British-Irish relationship and specifically our presence in the UK. The Government is committed to opening a new consulate in the north of England, a region linked to Ireland by history and our diaspora and which offers significant commercial opportunities. Ireland will work also to ensure the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK in the time remaining. Ireland’s place remains at the heart of the European Union. I will continue to inform the House on developments in the weeks ahead. </p>

          <p eId="para_392">The course that has emerged in the last month around Brexit has been dominated by the intent of the British Government literally to tear up the international treaty that is the withdrawal agreement. That this is a legally binding treaty, endorsed by the EU Parliament and the House of Commons matters nothing to the high Tories of the Johnson Government. The agreement, drawn up between the EU and the British Government, represented a compromise on both sides. No matter how he chooses to describe it now, make no mistake, this is Boris Johnson's agreement. The signing of the agreement was described by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as a "fantastic" moment, he boasted that it was "oven-ready", and he said that he believed it was an agreement that formed the basis for a future trade deal. Should we be surprised? One minister of this British Government previously stated, in quite an appalling manner during earlier negotiations on Brexit, that she believed the British could starve the Irish people into submission with food shortages. Obviously, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, did not get the memo on the perfidious nature of British negotiating tactics on Brexit when he tweeted as recently as 7 September that "Ireland has always accepted the good faith of Britain in #Brexit negotiations." Meanwhile, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, told the House of Commons that the internal markets Bill would break international law but in "a very specific and limited way". Our Government colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, has claimed: "I believe Britain will comply with its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement in the same way it has always respected its international Treaty obligations". The British Government and Boris Johnson could not be more explicit about their intent. The international community is very clear in its understanding of British intent and the potential disaster it threatens. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, took the opportunity of the visit of British Government minister Dominic Raab to the United States of America on 16 September, to school the British on the implications of their actions, when she told Mr. Raab: "If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress." The chairman of the powerful ways and means committee, Congressman Richard Neal, has echoed these concerns. A bipartisan letter was also sent to Boris Johnson ruling out a post-Brexit trade deal if the Good Friday Agreement was in any way undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> The EU negotiating team, led by Michel Barnier, and the EU Parliament have been steadfast in their support for the Irish protocol. The Vice President of the EU Commission has said "if the Bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an extremely serious violation of the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law." In comparison, the response of the Irish Government has been weak and wanting. This was illustrated by the Taoiseach's equivocation over whether or not to pick up the phone to Boris Johnson to tell him, in no uncertain terms, the Irish position on his disregard for the Irish protocol and the utter contempt he has shown towards the Good Friday Agreement. I put it to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that the Government needs to be stronger in defence of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> There are major concerns over the preparedness of the Irish economy for a potential no-deal Brexit. British MP Michael Gove has claimed in the last few days that there is potential for huge delays at ports across Britain. He has claimed that in a "reasonable worst-case scenario" between 30% and 50% of trucks crossing the English Channel will not be ready. This would lead to potentially more than 7,000 trucks backed up, bumper to bumper. RTÉ previously illustrated the potential for a traffic jam at Dover that would represent the equivalent of traffic being backed up from Dublin all the way to Waterford. Mr. Gove has further claimed that imports and exports could be affected for up to three months as the situation could worsen considerably if there are any Covid-19 outbreaks among customs staff. All of this is bad enough, but if Michael Gove describes it as a "reasonable worst-case scenario", then God help us when it becomes a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> In Ireland we face the potential of increased costs in supermarkets and the potential of Irish goods being supplanted in Britain by cheaper, inferior imports. I put it to the Minister that we need to prepare Irish businesses and we need to be on an emergency footing. The combined effects of Brexit and the Covid crisis represent unprecedented challenges and they demand unprecedented action. Brexit will come into being on 1 January 2021 at the end of the transition period, with or without a deal between Britain and the EU. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is on record as recently as last week stating, alone among his EU counterparts, that the British want to do a deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">We can only hope that he is right on that one. Regardless of whether a deal is struck, this will come to be seen as an horrific and misguided political decision that will haunt the British political classes into the future. It is the democratic right of the people of England to make that choice but what the British Government does not have is the right to impose that decision on the people of Scotland and the people in the North of Ireland who voted to reject Brexit in its entirety. The Internal Market Bill, which has been condemned by five former British Prime Ministers, including Theresa May who said that she would vote against it, bestows upon the British Government the unilateral power to impose its own rules on the devolved assemblies in Stormont and in Scotland. It gives the British Government the power to force the Northern Ireland Assembly to accept lower environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards. The Bill will also undermine the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and sideline areas of North-South co-operation and co-ordination. </p>
          <p eId="para_397"> A no-deal Brexit, which, despite the Minister's opinion, is looking more likely, raises the spectre of a hard border in Ireland. What the British want to achieve is a situation where having left the EU, they continue to enjoy all of the advantages that membership brings while positioning themselves to reap an unfair trading advantage over EU states through unfettered access to EU markets without any cost or responsibility. However, it is the assault on the Irish protocol that is the most worrying issue. The Irish protocol, which the British Government signed up to in the withdrawal agreement, despite its grievances, is designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the all-island economy, prevent a hard border and preserve the integrity of the Single Market. The protocol is part of an international agreement and is not dependent on any future agreement that may be reached between the EU and the Johnson government. It places the North under EU law regarding state aid which has the potential to reach across to Britain in given circumstances. This is anathema to the Tories and they are determined to get rid of it. To do this, they are prepared to wreck internationally binding agreements, deliberately and provocatively break the rule of law and recklessly endanger peace and stability on the island of Ireland. Conversely, the EU wants to protect the Good Friday Agreement through the Irish protocol and to protect member states from British predatory trading practices by insisting on the creation of a level playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> The British have also signalled their intention to reduce the influence and authority of the Human Rights Act, which became British law in 1998 and underpins the human rights components of the Good Friday Agreement. The Act has long been a target of the Conservatives who, under Theresa May, planned to scrap it entirely. The British have failed to honour other areas of the Agreement. There is no civic forum in the North, no all-Ireland civic forum, no bill of rights for the North, no joint North-South committee of the two human rights commissions and no all-Ireland charter of rights. </p>
          <p eId="para_399"> The only long-term solution to the problem of Brexit and British misrule in Ireland is Irish unity. A united Ireland is the only viable and logical solution. Ireland needs to start planning now for that eventuality. We need cross-party consensus in this Dáil on the Irish stance on Brexit. Time must be set aside by the Government next week to bring forward a cross-party motion on Brexit. The Seanad and the Assembly in the North have both passed motions and it is imperative that the Dáil does so too. Ireland needs to send a strong message to Boris Johnson. A message needs to come from this Dáil to the British Government and the international community that the island of Ireland is united. This island is absolutely and unequivocally opposed to Brexit, to the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill and the serious economic, social and political implications for the citizens of Ireland, North and South. Let us bring forward a motion that enjoys the support of all parties in Leinster House and all Deputies in this Dáil. Let us stand together and send a clear message to Boris Johnson that we as a people will not stand for the duplicity, folly and disregard shown by the British Government to the island of Ireland, the EU and the international community who stand in support of the Irish peace process. I urge the Minister to set aside time in the next week so that we can work together, set aside our political differences, unite on this and agree a cross-party motion that sends a clear, united message to Boris Johnson and the British Government on Brexit and the defence of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_400">In my previous life not so long ago, although it seems like an awfully long time, I was in the European Parliament where the issue of Brexit and the concerns around a no-deal Brexit took up significant amount of our time and deliberations. During all those debates, I could not think of a worse prospect for our country than a no-deal Brexit scenario. Little could I have imagined that we could be faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit scenario coupled with a global pandemic but that is the reality that is facing us, head on.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> A number of issues struck me in my conversations with many European colleagues in the European Parliament, in various embassies and within the European institutions throughout the Brexit talks process. One was their disbelief at the often duplicitous nature of the British stance in negotiations. They would tell me of their astonishment at situations where British ministers entered a room and negotiated a position but immediately on walking outside would start to unravel what they had just agreed. That was a source of astonishment but I consistently reminded them that nobody in my constituency would have been one bit surprised that the British Government would try to renege on agreements. Indeed, very few people in my constituency would be surprised that the British Government is intent on breaching international law. What we would all be surprised at, however, my European colleagues included, is that a British Minister would stand up in the House of Commons and acknowledge that it is the intention of the government to breach international law. </p>
          <p eId="para_402"> We need to stand firm because cannot rely on the British Government to protect Irish interests, stand up for the Good Friday Agreement or protect the objectives of the Irish protocol. My main concern with the Minister's statement is that it is predicated on a belief that the British Government is going to adhere to the withdrawal agreement even in the event of a no-deal Brexit. I have a real concern that in that scenario; the British will not do so. That creates huge challenges because then the responsibility lies with the Irish Government and the European Union to determine what we do with that thing that we call the Border in our country which, from my perspective, is far too hard already. </p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The second thing that struck me when talking to my European colleagues was that they were always willing and eager to talk about the issue of the reunification of our country in the context of Brexit because they saw it as a logical mitigation of the worst excesses of Brexit. A number of them said that among their number, the people most resistant to even having that conversation were Irish Government officials. That conversation needs to be had. If we are in a situation where it is a choice between putting in place barriers between my county and our neighbours in counties Fermanagh, Armagh or Tyrone or having a conversation about how we can make this country a better and fairer place, a united Ireland for all of our citizens, then we have to go with the latter. We have to have that conversation and the Government needs to step up to the plate.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">The Minister will be very familiar with the issue of jurisdiction over Lough Foyle. In November 2016, the then British Secretary of State, Mr. James Brokenshire, declared that the whole of Lough Foyle was within the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">That has always historically been rejected, not just by the Irish Government, but by the Irish people. The facts are that the British Government and the Crown Estate claim jurisdiction over all of Lough Foyle. One of the outworkings of the failure to resolve this issue is that we now have large numbers of unregulated oyster trestles along the western shore of Lough Foyle. Can we think of anywhere else around the coast of this State where we would tolerate a huge proliferation of aquaculture that is unregulated? Because of the failure to resolve the jurisdiction issues, we are left with this scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, to engage urgently with the British Government to draft joint legislation. These are disputed waters and we accept that they are disputed. However, we need to have joint legislation that gives bodies like the Loughs Agency increased powers to regulate aquaculture. It goes further than that, however. We now have the issue of Brexit, the withdrawal from the London fisheries agreement of the British Government and the fact access to their waters is front and centre of these trade negotiations. We are left with a sense that the failure to resolve this issue puts the fishing community in the Inishowen peninsula in serious peril. We need to get clarity from the British Government on its intentions, particularly in regard to the fishing waters in Lough Foyle and north of our island. I was speaking to a very prominent representative of the fishing industry in Ireland just this morning and his words were that the biggest threat to the industry in 100 years is Brexit. I ask for reassurance from the Minister on what he is doing about that issue and what he is doing to resolve the huge problems around Lough Foyle.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">I thank the Minister for his statement. While I do not wish to go over what has already been said, regardless of the outcome of the Internal Market Bill, and whether it is passed or not, the whole process involved has demonstrated very clearly to us what we would have already known, which is that we cannot trust the British. It should put us on a whole different level because, while east-west relationships are crucial, we have learned we cannot trust the British establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I commend the Minister for the stance he has taken. I watched his appearances on the Andrew Marr programme and other programmes, where he was very forthright in dealing with this and letting them know exactly how we felt about it. I also want to commend US Congressman Richard Neal, chairman of the ways and means committee, whose input has been crucial in all of this, as has that of Congressman Brendan Boyle and Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. The Taoiseach's attitude on Irish unity is a mistake, with him not even able to mention a united Ireland in his contributions. We need to learn from Scotland and how it is looking towards Scottish independence, and Wales as well. There has never been more need for us to progress a united Ireland and unity across our island. We should constantly remind the British of that and what they have done in terms of the break-up of their precious union. </p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I welcome the Minister's intention to provide supports for business. I speak to businesses every day of the week which are very fearful of the impact on them. This support will need to be in the form of direct aid and simply providing advice through the local employment offices and other agencies will not be sufficient to do the job we need done. The CAP negotiations are crucial in terms of the deal we get for farmers and agri-industry and the investment in key infrastructure projects is urgent and necessary. We spoke earlier about Knock Airport and the western rail corridor. These are the things that are going to sustain us. We cannot look at Brexit in isolation and we have to look at it in terms of the long-term investment in infrastructure projects. I welcome the Minister's highlighting of the reciprocal arrangements on education because the issue of third level exchange students travelling between North and South and between Ireland and Britain is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I ask the Minister to work with us. We commend our MEPs and others who, right from the beginning of Brexit, have sought to get support from member states and to get them to recognise the vulnerability of our island to Brexit and what the British might do, particularly in the case of a hard Brexit. I ask the Minister to work with us and we will work constructively with him. We have to put the Irish nation and businesses front and centre of all of this. We will certainly hold him to account on what he has said but we will work with him in every way we can. We need unity across this island.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_411">The introduction by the UK of the Internal Market Bill seems, to most sensible observers, the final act of madness in the bizarre handling of the withdrawal negotiations by the Johnson Government. To admit openly the intention of a sovereign government to break an international agreement in the midst of trying to negotiate a new agreement simply beggars belief for most of us. The unified reaction from the European Union, together with the very strong, sane voices that emerged from within the British political system, not only from the opposition benches but from distinguished former Prime Ministers in the UK, coupled with the clear warnings from Washington, at least from the non-Trump political part of Washington, seems to have somewhat halted the incredible gallop of the Johnson Government to the unthinkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I used to watch Fox News to get a glimpse of alternative America. It used to raise my blood pressure but I thought it was a good learning curve. I also, in similar fashion, occasionally read some of the Tory newspapers to have some understanding of the parallel universe inhabited by the most fervent Brexit cultists. I have to say the commentary is as depressing there as it is unreal and disconnected from any sense of reality. Some of the headlines read, “The EU is about to collapse”, or “Barnier is instructed by Germany to yield”. It is an incredible parallel world, but we have to understand it. Who knows what the next stage will be for the madness of King Boris? He may well cut a fair deal yet and abandon all that has gone before: that is not unthinkable. However, from our perspective, we must prepare for the inevitable, in my judgment. Maybe it is not inevitable, but I think we have to prepare for a hard Brexit. </p>
          <p eId="para_413"> I know significant preparations have been undertaken and that real work has been done across government in a way that is not paralleled in Britain and I absolutely acknowledge that. However, there is one area which is of deep concern to me and that is our ability to export and import to continental Europe in the immediate aftermath of 1 January. There is a significant irony that the focus of the British Government is on potential checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain while, now, it has said goods entering the county of Kent will require a special permit to avoid the expected chaos. Last week, the UK Road Haulage Association met with Cabinet Office Minister, Michael Gove, and his team.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">After that meeting, the CEO of the UK Road Haulage Association said that it "fell far short of our expectations." He continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_415">The mutually effective co-operation we wanted to ensure seamless border crossings just didn't happen and there is still no clarity over the questions that we have raised. Although I don’t think we are quite back to square one, we are certainly not much further along.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">After the same meeting, the chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation of the United Kingdom said: "There is no point pretending it’s going to be smooth – we are heading for major delays and disruption – systems are not ready, processes are unclear". Last week the BBC described the same meeting between the UK Road Haulage Association and the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Mr. Gove, as a "washout". The Road Haulage Association said that it got no clarity from the minister on how border checks would operate after the transition period. Amazingly, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said the same meeting had been constructive. </p>
          <p eId="para_417"> British hauliers believe there will be long tailbacks at ports and significant disruption to supply chains. Other Members have already referenced the leaked letter from Mr. Gove in which he acknowledged that there will be monumental disruption to the exit of goods from Britain into continental Europe from 1 January.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> What are we to do? I have been saying for a very long time that we need to be proactive in this regard. I had many discussions with the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and officials in the Department. Some €240 million remains in our connectivity fund from the €335 million originally included in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF. The land bridge is a very important link for our exports and imports. Some 150,000 Irish trucks use the UK land bridge to export 3 million tonnes of goods to the European Union. That is an enormously exit and entry point for goods. The Irish Road Haulage Association has urged Government to help set up a fast direct daily ferry service to continental Europe for lorries in order to avoid that chaos. The land bridge currently carries 40% of Irish exports and 13% of imports, both in terms of value and volume. That represents €18 billion worth of exports and €3 billion worth of imports. </p>
          <p eId="para_419"> We need to use the resources in the connectivity fund to prepare, just as we did when the Covid pandemic started. We asked what the most urgent issue to address was, which was, at the time, the preparation of intensive care units and the expansion of intensive care capacity. We should be thankful this capacity was not utilised but it would have been absolutely unconscionable not to prepare for what potentially could have happened when we saw what was happening in other jurisdictions at that stage. Similarly, we need to provide direct links. We are too dependent on the British land bridge. </p>
          <p eId="para_420"> We are also too dependent on Dublin Port. This week, we saw rationing, or metering as it is called, of trucks into Dublin Port. I obviously have a bias in favour of Rosslare Europort but it is an underutilised resource. There is a very good road network leading to it and, in very recent times, the State has invested significantly in expanding its potential and more investment is ongoing. We need to proactively talk to shipping companies rather than take their word for it that something is going to happen. We need to proactively ensure that there is real competition and real capacity. We need to give an equity stake in new companies or service provision supports for new companies so that, although we will not be able to obviate all the impact of the chaos I believe we will see on 1 January if a deal is not secured, we can mitigate it. </p>
          <p eId="para_421"> We can mitigate this chaos if we have more direct links, thereby taking trucks off the UK land bridge. We must sign up and support additional ferries and nail down the exact number of vessels existing companies will have available on 1 January, where they will berth, what kind of vessels they are, what capacity they have and at what times they sail. Bluntly, there is currently too cosy a relationship in Rosslare Europort in my home county of Wexford. There are two very important operators there but they sail for the Continent on the same three days of the week. It suits them to do that but we need much more competition. We need to open up those markets. I want the Government to be proactive in this respect because the very first test of the success of our Brexit preparations after 1 January will be our capacity to continue to import and to export goods from this island directly to continental Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I have one clear message for the Government today. I hope the Minister is listening and will take careful note of it. We need to have a very clear understanding of the number of vessels that will be sailing directly from Irish seaports, including what I hope will be a greatly increased number from Rosslare Europort in addition to those leaving the Port of Cork and Dublin Port. These will be direct links to a variety of ports across continental Europe from Spain as far as the Netherlands. I look forward to a comprehensive reply in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">I will be sharing time with Deputy O'Connor. We will take six and a half minutes each. We are repeating our combination of last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> The Minister and I have been following Brexit at a level far beyond anything I ever could have dreamed of for quite some time. It is not an understatement to say that the past fortnight has been the worst period of this process, even including the period prior to the referendum. The tabling of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill 2019-21 and the specific amendments thereto that run a cart and horses through the Irish protocol of the withdrawal agreement were extremely disappointing and soured the mood for a period. I know the Minister has engaged with his counterparts in the UK and, more importantly, across the EU, including the former Commissioner, Mr. Barnier, who is the EU's negotiator.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> It needs to be repeated that the Bill, in its current form, remains completely unacceptable. It violates a binding international agreement and the responsibilities of the British and Irish Governments and of the entire EU remain clear under that withdrawal agreement. When we talk about that withdrawal agreement and this Internal Market Bill, what does all this say about the UK and the world and about the ability of a great country like the UK to honour its agreements and to meet the rule of law internationally? I do not say that glibly. The UK has just negotiated a trade agreement with Japan modelled on the world's largest existing trade agreement, the European partnership agreement between Japan and the EU. This agreement has been negotiated and agreed but has it been ratified? Why ratify an agreement with a country if that country is prepared to break that agreement only months later?</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> If I have said it once, I have said it a million times; there is no such thing as a good Brexit. There is no good Brexit for Ireland, for the EU or, particularly, for the UK. That is why it behoves everyone, including our negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Lord Frost, to negotiate to the very last minute and to continue to negotiate. A deal is absolutely vital for all concerned. A no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating for Ireland and for the UK. </p>
          <p eId="para_427"> We need to salvage our relationship with the UK from this process. I have no problem castigating the British Government when it has gone wrong. I sometimes get in a little bit of trouble for doing so. I also have no problem making sure it is held to account and nor does the Minister. We cannot, however, burn bridges. It is disappointing to hear people in this Chamber say this afternoon that one cannot touch or trust the British. They may have been talking specifically about the occurrences-----</p>

          <p eId="para_429">Let me finish. Deputy Conway-Walsh may have been talking specifically about the current British Government. I accept that but we have to remember that not every single person in the UK necessarily holds the same opinions as Boris Johnson or Dominic Cummings. We need that relationship and we need to work for it, regardless of the form Brexit takes, in order to ensure a warm and close relationship with everyone in the United Kingdom, whether in Scotland, England or Wales. I welcome the new British ambassador to Ireland and look forward to meeting him when he finishes his period of self-isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I wish to pay credit to the outgoing British ambassador, Robin Barnett, and wish him well on his retirement. He was a good friend of Ireland and the EU at a difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I wish to finish my contribution by looking about our role and place within the European Union in the context of the weeks just gone and the weeks to come. The whole process in recent years has reinforced the importance of Ireland's place within the European Union. We negotiate this process not as a small island nation but as part of a union of almost 500 million people. It is the world's largest economic block. It is a union founded first and foremost on the preservation of peace. Let us not get lost talking about directives, trade negotiations, straight bananas and blue passports. Let us bring it back to what the European project is about. It is about peace. The withdrawal agreement is about protecting peace too. We may look about our role within the EU and recovery from Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I wish to endorse every word Deputy Howlin said relating to connectivity to the Continent. I welcome the fact that operators have said there is capacity. It is no longer about simply going from Rosslare to Cherbourg or Le Harve. It is now about Santander, Portugal, Ostende, Zeebrugge and, maybe in due course, it will be Duisburg. It is about opening up to aspects of what is Ireland's largest export market. This is not the UK; it is the EU. That is where our future must be. The more we can convince companies and entities to ship direct to the Continent, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Will the Minister outline what exact efforts are being made in this regard? How do we bring on board companies to show that there is a comparable alternative to the land bridge? How can we show that cost and pace can be worked on? How do we convince operators, as Deputy Howlin has said so eloquently, of the commercial viability of continuing with shipping, whether from Dublin or Cork? As a proud Dubliner, I agree with Deputy Howlin that the future is in Rosslare. Rosslare Europort has a direct link to the train line. It has the capacity to open up the entire island.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Of course, we have to work out our interests within the EU. This is the key point. Last week or a fortnight previous when the UK Internal Market Bill was presented, we all got push notifications on a Sunday night. The British media became obsessed with this issue and it was headline and breaking news. We were told about the important compromise in Westminster between the Conservative UK Government and the rebel backbenchers. The compromise is worth absolutely nothing. The former UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, has said as much. There seems to be a belief that what happens in Westminster is the only important thing in the Brexit debate. It is not. This is a conversation between the EU and the UK. It needs to be a conversation between sovereign equals. It needs to be realised that the negotiations are between Michel Barnier and Lord Frost, not within Westminster. The difficulty for us is how we keep the interest of our colleagues in the other 26 EU member states. Brexit may be headline news in London. It may be the third item on the news here. However, the Minister and I know that our colleagues are barely paying attention any more on the Continent.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesOConnor" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Deputy James O'Connor<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_435">I thank the Minister for being here. I am conscious that I am probably one of the first Deputies elected to Dáil Éireann who grew up with the Good Friday Agreement in place. I am part of a generation that saw peace come to this island and violence eventually come to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> This peace is now being threatened by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the UK Internal Market Bill. It is welcomed that the EU will not allow the UK Internal Market Bill or any other legislation that would undermine the protocol in Northern Ireland to be used as a negotiating tactic by the United Kingdom. We cannot and must not allow peace on this island to be undermined or an international treaty obligation to be broken. I support the Minister, the Government and the EU in ensuring that these laws are upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> However, we must recognise that from 1 January 2021, the way we trade with the United Kingdom will be dramatically different. We must prepare accordingly and ensure a smooth transition occurs. I am keen to take the opportunity today specifically to speak about the needs of our agricultural sector, with a focus on protecting family farms. I live on a family dairy farm. I am acutely aware of the potential harm that could be done to this sector by a disorderly Brexit. Brexit will change the way the Irish agrifood business trades with the UK, its customers and suppliers. The United Kingdom will become a third country at the end of the transition period. This will see the introduction of new customs formalities, including import and export declarations, prenotifications for certain products and produce, licence requirements and other regulatory requirements. I wish to highlight the issues faced by the dairy industry. I do so because thousands of families in my constituency of Cork East rely on the agrifood sector for their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> While I am the first to recognise that Ireland's dependence on the UK market has fundamentally changed since Ireland and the UK first joined what was then the European Economic Community, it is clear that the Irish dairy industry is highly reliant on exports to the UK market. The UK is Ireland's largest market for food and drink, with 40% of our food exports destined to the United Kingdom. In 2016, 34% of Ireland's dairy exports went to the UK, representing 53% of our cheese exports, 29% of our butter and 12% of our skim milk powder, SMP. Exports of cheddar cheese were 78,000 tonnes, representing 82% of all cheddar imported by the UK in 2016. Ireland is the only significant exporter of cheddar to the UK market and the UK is the only market of significance for Irish cheddar. We must ensure this market is protected and a sensible agreement must be reached to ensure that such markets stay open.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> We face two major issues with the dairy industry. The first is an over-reliance on a single market and the potential disruption of a vital supply chain. While I welcome the supports that the Government is proposing in its Brexit readiness action plan, including a €2 billion credit guarantee scheme, we need to think more broadly about market diversification of this industry. Major capital investment has been made across the country by family farms in recent years since the abolition of the quotas. There is a real fear that this will potentially all go to waste. Irish farm output has jumped by almost 50% since 2010, predominantly because of the lifting of the milk quotas. Frankly, there needs to be more focus on a transition out of the UK market. We cannot act within the reality of what we want but must act on the reality that is. It is growing every more likely that we will find it difficult to have any sort of comparable access to the UK market that we previously enjoyed. We must act accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I know great work has been done by the likes of Bord Bia and other semi-State bodies to promote market diversification. However, it is critical that supports are put in place at local level to ensure small family farms are supported in this market transition. We should not be seen to be simply plastering over the cracks and hope that the house will not collapse when we should have been looking for a new house to start afresh.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> The second issue I mentioned was the need to ensure that the Northern Ireland protocol is upheld. We must ensure the Union customs code and other EU provisions necessary to preserve the integrity of the Single Market are upheld and ensure that they continue to apply to and in Northern Ireland. The current highly integrated all-Ireland milk processing structures will not survive if these are not upheld. It is true that were we able to reconfigure our supply chain in the wake of Covid-19, and many efforts have been made to do so, it could do much to protect the sector. However, in terms of viability, the dairy sectors of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will be dramatically and negatively impacted if a configuration away from Northern Ireland was to arise. We must have all-Ireland approaches when it comes to managing our resources. Any negative blockade to this would be unwise for the maintenance of peace. It would be unjustified economically and not in the best interests of family farms across the country. I know the Minister is committed to ensuring the Northern Ireland protocol stays in place. We need to do all we can to protect our agrifood connections with the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> I wish to echo Deputy Richmond's comments welcoming the new British ambassador to Ireland. I know he arrived in the past week. I also wish the former ambassador the best of luck in his future career.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">The Irish Government is co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent agreements should be the utmost priority of this Government. We have all benefited from the peaceful solution offered by the Good Friday Agreement. This needs to be protected. Customs infrastructure on the island of Ireland will jeopardise this peace. Peace needs to be protected at all costs. I am asking that this Government does precisely that.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The Irish protocol reflects in a small way the wishes of the majority in the Six Counties to remain part of the EU. We need to ensure that all people on this island have the option of availing of benefits of EU membership. The ultimate solution to a no-deal Brexit is to start a conversation of uniting Ireland. We need the Government to convey the wishes of the people to the British Secretary of State to the effect it is time to start the process of preparing for a unity referendum. There needs to be informed discussions on how reunification will affect the lives of all citizens on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Irish unity makes sense not only from an economic point of view but also from an agricultural one, by treating the island of Ireland as one market. It certainly makes sense from a biosecurity point of view, particularly in light of the recent emergence of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Britain has left the European Union, as is its right. We need to defend the rights of Irish citizens living in the North, who have nobody to advocate for them. The Government needs to ensure their voice is heard at the highest level. We also need to ensure that a fair deal is agreed to between Britain and the EU so that farming families have unimpeded access to larger markets. I ask the Minister to look after this.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">As we are all aware, in the past few weeks the British have done a U-turn on the withdrawal agreement. Businesses throughout our island have already been brought to their knees by the pandemic and now they again have to contend with the shock of a potential no-deal Brexit. The British are clearly not prepared for this eventuality and their chaotic approach will affect Irish businesses on both sides of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> We heard this week about the latest problems affecting hauliers due to delays and queues at Dover. It is a farce. If the British proceed with their plan to break international law, it will have a detrimental effect on everybody on this island. Workers in the North could be affected by weaker labour and environmental standards to cut production costs in Britain. In this State, we face the potential for price increases in shops and the possibility of exports to Britain being replaced with cheap imports. I represent a Border community and constituency, and I reiterate there will be no hard border here. It will not happen. We fought hard for the Irish protocol to protect us from all this and to protect the Good Friday Agreement, and the British now want to destroy all that with their no-deal Brexit. The Government has to step up and fight for the rights of all Irish citizens on this island and to protect communities and businesses. We cannot expect the EU to fight this on its own. The Government needs to take a much stronger approach to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> I could not understand why Government Deputies were so surprised that the British would break the agreement. Anyone who watched the documentary "Unquiet Graves" last week will have been given a stark reminder of the British attitude towards Ireland and the Irish people. The British have never done right by the people in the North and, in fairness, nor have successive Governments down here either. We have to step up now and fight against the outrageous and arrogant behaviour of the Tories and protect our island, our peace and our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> We all know, of course, that the only logical solution to this mess is the reunification of our country. This very real conversation needs to start at Government level here and it needs to do so urgently.</p>

        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_452">There is now no doubt as to how serious the circumstances are in which we find ourselves with respect to Brexit and the prospect of Brexit without a trade deal. The so-called bulletproof backstop - the guarantee that no matter what, there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland as a result of the UK's departure from the EU - was traded in by the previous Government for a withdrawal agreement the UK Government is now violating. We have heard media reports of the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade saying the avoidance of a hard border after Brexit is now not guaranteed, while Donald Trump's special envoy to Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has warned against the dangers of creating a hard border.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> With respect to the UK's Internal Market Bill, which seeks to allow the UK to break the agreement it has made, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis, confirmed in the House of Commons that the Bill will break international law. There has been significant reaction and fallout from this, not least from within the UK itself, where some of the strongest opposition to this has emerged. We should differentiate, when we are talking about the actions of the UK Government, between the UK Government and the British people. They are not the same and, in fact, some of the people who will pay the greatest price for Brexit are the British people.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> We should also recognise there has been strong opposition from within the UK. Jonathan Jones, the Treasury Solicitor, resigned from his position in protest; Richard Keen, the Advocate General for Scotland, resigned in protest; Amal Clooney resigned her position as the UK's special envoy on media freedom in protest at the legislation; Theresa May, the former Prime Minister, said it would cause untold damage to Britain's standing in the world; Tony Blair and John Major, in a joint article, described the legislation as shameful; while outside of the UK, too, there has been strong opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> The US presidential candidate, Joe Biden, has spoken out against it strongly and Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, said there would be no chance of a US-UK trade deal going ahead if the UK altered its withdrawal agreement with the EU. There is a decent prospect that Joe Biden will be elected in the presidential election and his priorities for concluding trade deals are likely to be quite different from those of the incumbent. He may well value a trade deal with the EU over and above one with the UK. In addition, the Northern Ireland Assembly has passed a motion opposing the Internal Market Bill and the Scottish Government has threatened to fight the Bill's provisions in the courts. Maroš Šefcovic, the EU Commissioner in charge of the implementation of the agreement, has confirmed that the Commission is studying all legal options on the table in case the UK fails to back down on passing the Bill, and national governments throughout the EU have stated they increasingly believe that the UK Government does not want to reach a deal with the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> While the prospects of a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement, which is strongly in the interests of Ireland, the EU and the UK, are not looking as positive as we would all have hoped, it would still be a mistake to conclude, based on the previous erratic behaviour of the UK Administration, that a deal will definitely, or will definitely not, be done. We simply do not know at this point. There is, of course, every prospect that the latest negotiating tactics by the UK Government are part of a strategy to run down the clock to secure a bare-bones, zero-quota, zero-tariff agreement, with minimal commitments on the part of the UK. That is what it has always sought. What is happening at this stage is having a considerable impact on the UK. Research from the Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy shows that the areas that voted for Brexit in the largest numbers are the areas with the greatest poverty in the UK. The former industrial areas are already being hit hardest by Brexit, and worse, unfortunately, will follow. The City of London also has the potential to lose a significant amount if its access to the EU for its financial services market is hit. We also know that investment in the retail section of UK equity has hit an historic record low due to Covid-19 and Brexit. Some €15 billion worth of costs will apply to UK businesses due to the bureaucracy of the customs declarations that will have to be done, and that is before any tariffs are applied. There will be significant economic fallout for the UK and it is the British people, and in particular those in the midlands and the north of England, who will pay the heaviest price for this. In that regard, I welcome the comments from the Minister about the establishment of a consulate in northern England.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> In respect of the arguments about state aid, it is worth remembering that the Tory Party has, historically and especially in recent decades, been dead against state aid or any government support or intervention. It is quite a recent argument, therefore, that it is making. In fact, the EU state aid rules, if they were adopted and adhered to by the UK, would be quite beneficial for the UK. They are really about channelling subsidies into productive areas such as research, decarbonisation and the training and upskilling of workers. It is very much, therefore, in the interests of the UK to agree to a set of principles that would mirror those of the EU. The EU state aid rules are also very much about preventing governments, local or national, from embarking on a race to the bottom by competing for investors through subsidies. They also impose transparency and reduce cronyism. They are absolutely in the UK's interests. In these negotiations, we must not lose sight, as the Minister noted, of the importance of a level playing field in other areas, including workers' rights and responding to climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">That is especially important in the context of continued reports we get from the UK of sweatshop labour conditions in some areas, with clothes manufacturers paying as little as £3.50 per hour due to the lax enforcement of employment laws and the minimum wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> If one was to take a cynical view of the negotiating tactic being adopted by the UK Government, one might think that it is seeking the frictionless entry of goods from the UK to the European Single Market on a zero-tariff and zero-quota basis, without a level playing field on workers' rights and environmental protections and that the strategy of the UK Government to put the focus on the UK Internal Market Bill and state aid is a distraction from that. That said, at this point we must do everything in our power to prepare and step up preparations, as I know the Department is doing, for a no trade deal Brexit. It is good that there has been engagement from the Department with transporters and ferry companies but I strongly urge the Minister and the Department to take as much of a hands-on approach on that as possible and to really get into the detail of that. For the first few months, regardless of whether there is a deal or no deal, and especially if there is no deal, it is of crucial national importance to our economy, businesses and exporters, particularly in the context of Covid-19, that everything is done to ensure strong alternative direct routes are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> It is welcome that the research done by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, shows that the parts of the Irish economy that are most exposed to Covid-19 do not correspond directly to the parts of the economy that are most exposed to Brexit. Nonetheless, we are facing a double shock and hit on this. It is imperative that all the work that can be done on that is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> My party, the Social Democrats, supports the efforts of the Irish Government and the European Union negotiating team to secure a trade deal. That has to remain the objective. It is of key national strategic importance to us, the entire European Union and the people of the UK. With that said, we must be prepared for all possible outcomes in the coming weeks. The preparations for a no trade deal Brexit must be stepped up and I know work is ongoing on that, which I welcome and support.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">All of the Dublin Bay North Deputies are on their feet today. On 1 January 2021, the UK will be outside the EU's Single Market and the customs union. This has huge implications for our SMEs, our agricultural sector and our economy generally. Already, our businesses are suffering from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit is a double-whammy for them. We must do everything we can to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland in the short time left to us, given these adverse circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Negotiations between the EU and the UK are continuing but we need real engagement from both sides. As we know, however, the time is short. We need a free trade agreement and a sane and sensible outcome for all of us. A no deal Brexit would be bad for the UK, Ireland, a number of EU states and the EU generally. The withdrawal agreement and the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol protects the peace process and avoids a hard Border on the island of Ireland. It must be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I also want to put on the record my concern in respect of the UK Internal Market Bill. This Bill gives British ministers the power to override the withdrawal agreement and the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol. It breaches international law and must not be implemented. For many democrats, the introduction of the Bill by the UK Government and the blatant attempt to break international law that it represents is truly shocking. The former British Prime Minister, Theresa May, when speaking in the House of Commons, hit the nail on the head when she stated that the Internal Market Bill is reckless and damaging to Britain's standing in the eyes of the world. Who would have thought that such a thing could happen? We live in strange times. Trust between the EU and the UK has been damaged and this must be repaired as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> In this context, I welcome the support given in recent days for the Irish position by the Democratic Party Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi addressed this House during the last Dáil and all of us are in indebted to her for her unfailing help on this issue. When she spoke in the Dáil, Democratic Party Congressman Richard Neal was also present and he too has been a constant champion of the Irish position. We can hope that the recent comments by US presidential Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden on this issue also bode well for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> I would also like to draw attention to the remarks of the President of the European Commission, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, when she said in her state of the union address earlier this month that the EU would never backtrack on the withdrawal agreement and that it was the best and only way for ensuring peace on the island of Ireland. In passing, I also agree with everything the President of the European Commission said about the late John Hume. He was one of the great Europeans, who understood that difference is the essence of humanity. I wanted to put that on the record and convey my sympathy to the Hume family on the passing of John Hume, who did so much to bring about peace and stability on the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Specifically, I want to raise the concerns articulated by the Irish Road Haulage Association following the statement by Michael Gove in the House of Commons yesterday. Michael Gove warned about possible queues of 7,000 trucks in the port of Dover and two-day delays to cross over to the European mainland. It raises the question as to how stands the agreement reached with the UK to the effect that Irish lorries will be fast-tracked through customs, if such lorries are held up in these queues. What can the Government do to assist the transport of goods by Irish companies using the UK land bridge? When the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, is summing up he might address that issue because it seems to be a real issue for the Irish road hauliers, as articulated in the press today.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Time is short, as the Minister said earlier. I appreciated the update he gave to the House on the negotiations and the issues of the level playing field, governance and fisheries, which are all extremely important and much work needs to be done in those areas. I would also like to reiterate what the Minister said about the need to develop relationships between the EU and the UK going forward, when all this has been sorted out one way or the other. More specifically, we need to develop relationships between Ireland and the UK in the future. I know this came up in the discussions on the programme for Government and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, had some ideas on that but work will need to be done there as well to see how we can foster those relationships when the UK finally leaves the European Union. We are in the transition period and a lot of discussions are taking place but we need to put work into that area and examine what institutions or organisations can be established to facilitate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> We need a future relationship and a free trade agreement, even a bare bones agreement. Time is running out and I wish the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade well in the coming weeks in their endeavours to bring this about.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">I thank Deputy Haughey for sharing time on this issue. It is always said that the darkest hour is before the dawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">It certainly seems dark from this vantage point. In the UK the political "remainers" have effectively folded their cards and given up on that path.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> I saw reports in the newspapers that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade detected that fellow member states felt "gamed" and impatient about the British position of deciding that, effectively, it does not want a deal. We have seen the binary type of politics emanating from 10 Downing Street and it has become a feature that has cowed much debate in the UK, which is really unfortunate. We have also seen the UK Internal Market Bill that seeks to design an escape clause from a formal international agreement. These are indeed dark moments.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> Nevertheless, this is the time for cool heads and if it is not indulgent to say so, we are very fortunate to have the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the helm as he has just that capacity for staying cool in the face of enormous provocation. This is not a time for revisiting popular theses about postcolonial delusion, although I see much commentary on this in the Irish media, nor is it the time for raising the rhetoric around the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, which I have heard repeated in this House. This is a time when we must recognise that there are major economic, social and political implications at stake. We must play a game that is not provocative but which is deliberate and determined. In the Minister we have somebody who will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Those who are interested in game theory will recognise some of the aggressive negotiating tactics being used. It is important to remember that the UK sends 45% of goods and services to EU markets. We are very dependent on the UK as 18% of our goods and services go there but that is nothing compared with the UK dependency on EU markets. The stakes for Britain are enormously high in this debate and we must think about how we can start to orchestrate those interests that may be damaged enormously in order to change the current views.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> We must also show some level of understanding of what is going on. The UK Internal Market Bill has been staggering for lawyers as it raises the spectre of an international agreement being torn up. We need to be a little more forensic in some of consideration of the content. The UK feels it should escape the export declarations from Northern Ireland but there are such exemptions in Norway and Switzerland, so that matter may not be entirely insurmountable. In deciding the categories for onward transmission to the Republic of Ireland and thereby the EU market, the joint committee may be able to work out some resolutions. If there are genuine concerns, there may be a way forward. As well as raising our justified concern about reneging on an international agreement, we must consider the concerns that may be expressed beneath and whether they can be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> On state aid, I served my term early on the European Council when Lord Cockfield, that great Tory spokesman, was the determined promoter of the Single Market and the need to move away from petty obstructions from those on the Continent in the entry to the market, including narrow-gauge wheels or 13 oz bottles of jam. He was the great advocate of harmonisation and the Single Market and he was very disparaging of those who would seek to use state aid to promote their national champions. It is a cruel irony that the UK has completely turned tail in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The British Government is currently in the dock in its own country for its competence. As the day gets nearer and the tangible economic damage that this will do to Britain gets closer, our diplomats should work slowly to probe the vulnerability in the British stance, including the risk to the financial sector and data recognition. The silence of British enterprise is remarkable even still at this late hour and we must explain in a calm way the advantages of this deal, using the voices in Scotland, Wales and the dependent territories, as they are called. We must flex the muscle of other countries, such as the US in particular, as well as others where Britain is seeking an international trade agreement after Brexit. It should be clear that the British action now jeopardises such deals.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on his work and ask him to persist in the determined way he has exhibited to date. There will be no vaccine for a no-deal Brexit if that virus is released. We need to do everything in our power to prevent that outcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">Today we saw the leaders of the pro-Remain parties in the North travel to Dublin to raise their concerns about the impact of the UK Internal Market Bill on the North. The Bill flies in the face of strands one, two and three of the Good Friday Agreement. It allows the British Government to remove powers that were devolved to the Executive in the North, which is in complete disregard to strand one of the agreement. We now see the Assembly has voted to oppose this UK Internal Market Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The word "precedents" was used by Mr. Brandon Lewis, MP, when he advised Westminster that the British Government would be breaking an international agreement. He said there were precedents for the British Government needing to consider its international obligations. This should not be a shock to any of us and I am surprised by some of the contributions I listened to earlier. This should come as no surprise to us in Ireland as we are fully aware of Britain's attitude to international obligations. One stark example personal to me was when, in 1995, the European Court of Human Rights found that the British Government had violated Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life, when it murdered three people in Gibraltar. We cannot allow any British Government to ever again disregard international laws or obligations in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> There is a solution provided in the Good Friday Agreement and we are obliged to consider it now. It is the holding of a referendum on Irish unity. I have heard some politicians saying today that such a suggestion is provocative but at a time when British politicians have admitted in their Parliament that they are willing to break an international agreement by publishing this Bill, with the people of the North simply collateral damage to the plan, the mind boggles that the suggestion of a referendum could be provocative.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I appeal especially to Deputies from the Government parties who consider themselves advocates for a united Ireland not to be part of another Government in a long history of Governments that stands idly by while the liberties of the people of the North are trampled. It is absolutely now time for Irish unity.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">I will use this time to address the issues caused by Brexit here and across the world. In June 2016, England and Wales voted to leave the European Union and this vote would change the landscape of the EU, the UK and Ireland for years to come. In effect, the North of Ireland and Scotland were forced out of the EU against the will of their people. Four years on, we are still talking about Brexit. The referendum took place long before I was elected to the House, yet here I am addressing the Dáil on the matter. It is madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The British Prime Minister and his Cabinet have long claimed they are Brexit ready but the reality is the complete opposite. They have no plan and they are not ready for 1 January next year. Leaked documents in the past number of days indicate that internal government notes have warned about delays at the port of Dover if there is a no-deal Brexit. Regardless of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's views on Brexit, it is time that we on this side of the water put down our foot and got tough on the matters at hand. We must show leadership here and right across the world, indicating that we will not agree to anything less than full acceptance of the withdrawal agreement, including the full protection of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The Six Counties cannot and must not be used as a bargaining chip in all this. In a week when we saw two documentaries on RTÉ, "Unquiet Graves" and a programme on the Holy Cross schoolgirls, we know we cannot allow any agreement that would see the return of any hard border on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The Good Friday Agreement has been hailed throughout the world as an agreement that was well ahead of its time. However, the stories told in these documentaries and countless others show there are still unresolved grievances. The lack of discussion of these issues in any public forum in the past several years, particularly following the airing of these documentaries, has been deafening. Politicians in the Twenty-six Counties have engaged in scaremongering, arguing that a united Ireland is something to shy away from. This is not the case. Brexit has clearly shown why we need to start discussing a united Ireland. Provision was made in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 to eventually pave the way to this discussion. Now it is time to start it. We cannot allow more than 20 years of peace to be unravelled by more British political incompetence.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_489">I cannot see into the mind of Boris Johnson, MP, and I am not sure I would want to, because I would say it is a pretty scary place but what we can say about him is that one of his biggest international backers is President Donald Trump, another man whose mind I would not like to see into, as it would be even scarier. As we speak, Donald Trump is willing to incite civil war in the United States if he does not win a general election. If Trump is the more extreme version of a certain type of political madness that is unfortunately taking off around the world at the moment, Boris Johnson is his Mini-Me. I would, therefore, not be so complacent as to suggest that reason will prevail. Rationality is not a characteristic of extreme right-wing, imperially minded, hard nationalist politics. It is not reasonable. If one looked at this reasonably, one would conclude that the British Government wants to do a deal and these are just negotiating tactics. However, looking at the records of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson and where the sort of politics they are propounding have historically led, one sees that acting reasonably is not a feature. These people are quite capable of going on wrecking missions. Trump has done that in the United States. Boris Johnson has treated his own people with utter recklessness during the Covid-19. He is threatening the health and welfare of ordinary working-class British people. That is the record of the Tory party, particularly the rotten wing that Johnson represents, which is given to nostalgia for the glory days of empire. We have to understand that we are in a serious and dangerous situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> Being complacent and hoping that reason will prevail is not a strategy. That means we have to defeat what Boris Johnson represents. We have to be very tough and say that peace and security on this island will not be a pawn in the dangerous game he is playing. Under no circumstances can we allow his wrecking agenda to lead to the erection of a border on this island, which would threaten the peace and stability we have achieved. We also need to say to the EU that we will not be a pawn in any game it is playing with Boris Johnson. We must be clear that we will not be anybody's pawn and that we will not accept a hard border in any circumstances or for any reason, or the question of the re-establishment of a board being a bargaining chip in the game and the negotiations. We cannot allow that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> In that context, it is not dangerous or a mistake to put forward the argument for ending partition and bringing about the unification of this country. The people of Britain, the North and Scotland are not stupid. They understand how dangerous Boris Johnson is. His agenda is revealing itself to huge numbers of people, who perhaps would not have questioned certain allegiances previously but who can see the irrationality, recklessness and danger of what he is pursuing. The Government appears to think this is a no-go area and that it is somehow threatening to talk about ending partition and uniting this island. Now is the time that putting that argument forward makes sense. </p>
          <p eId="para_492"> In doing so, we have to make it clear that uniting this island is about making a better country than either of the ones that exist at the moment, North or South. Unionism maintaining its grip in the North has a lot to do with pointing at deficiencies in the South such as the control of the Catholic Church, the conservative nature of the State and, once upon a time, economic backwardness. Even now the lack of a national health service is an issue. There is a strong argument for taking an all-Ireland approach to dealing with the mortal threat of Covid-19. We need an integrated national health service across the island. If we champion issues such as the separation of church and State, a national health service and a sane, all-Ireland approach to tackling Covid-19, we can open the door to challenging the rotten nationalism of Boris Johnson and the rotten politics of the DUP and Orangeism. That is the approach we have to take. It is not about saying how superior we are to Boris Johnson; it is about showing in practice that we have an agenda for a changed Ireland. Historically, big shifts in allegiances have taken place at critical moments. Under particular circumstances of economic or political crisis, people who thought they had certain religious or cultural allegiances have begun to question them. That is a time when that is happening. </p>
          <p eId="para_493"> It is time to start talking about ending partition on the basis of uniting Catholic and Protestant working people in the fight for a different republic, the sort of republic James Connolly fought for. That is not just idle rhetoric. This is a truly opportune moment. We are at an historic crossroads for all sorts of reasons. We have to radically change the sort of republic we are fighting for down here to make unification a seriously attractive option for people from all backgrounds, North and South.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">I would like to raise the issue of connectivity. Yesterday, I raised the aviation sector with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton. There are very particular challenges there, as the Minister will be well aware. This morning, we heard from Mr. Eugene Drennan, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, and Mr. John Martin, the policy manager for haulage association in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">They share the same concerns, albeit from geographically different perspectives. They stated that trade will be severely upset because of Brexit and the price of some goods could double. They stated the impact will be significant and that they have been warning about it for two years. Systems that were promised and planned are not in place either here or in Britain. On the British side, customs agents have not been recruited and the goods vehicle management system, GVMS, and Smart Freight IT system are not in place. There is a threat - it is to be hoped that is all it is - that there could be queues of up to 7,000 vehicles at ports in Britain. Our own systems are not up and running. There is no contingency planning. There are approximately 800,000 to 1 million movements of units annually between Ireland and Britain alone. It is a massive challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> I am sure I do not have to tell the Minister about the strategic importance of connectivity for us as an island nation. This morning, the two spokespersons to whom I referred addressed the issues of surety of service, timelines, just-in-time delivery and the whole logistics operation on which so much of our economy and livelihoods depend. They spoke of the need for an alternative route bypassing Britain and going straight to the Continent. What I wish to emphasise is that we have only a few months to prepare and, as the saying goes, failing to prepare is preparing to fail. The window of opportunity is very limited. Every effort must be made to put the required systems in place. I refer to the three-step system that has been promised on this side because the obvious consequences on 1 January and thereafter are spectacular and need to be avoided at all costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">The Internal Market Bill, which is currently before the House of Commons, has demonstrated and categorically defined the British Prime Minister's stance and his dismissive attitude towards the Good Friday Agreement, Ireland and, indeed, international law. I welcome the support from the EU 27 and the USA, particularly Nancy Pelosi, in coming out strongly in defence of the Good Friday Agreement, the people of the North and the Border counties. The catchphrase that we are all in this together could not be more aptly used than during the current impasse.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> We must now deal with the fallout from Brexit and its repercussions for the beef industry, agrifood exports, the fishing industry, hauliers, retailers, tourism and ports, all of which are major active economic players in the commerce of our nation, including in my county of Wexford. We must be geared up and tooled up to face the inevitable challenges of bureaucratic tax regulations and the reams of paperwork that will follow, not to mention the impending long delays for businesses and industries that will add crippling costs to doing business. I am sure that, even at this late stage, the Minister will move to protect, without prejudice, the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish protocol. We must also protect the fishing industry and coastal communities. The answer is not to tie up boats at piers or to park tractors on beef farms, which would result in the loss of thousands of jobs, including in County Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I conclude by asking the Minister about Rosslare Europort and the preparations there. Has the Government prepared a traffic impact management plan for Rosslare Europort as it did for Dublin Port? If not, when will that be done? There are many risks to be considered for every constituency on this island when it comes to Brexit. We must act now to deal with the fallout and to protect the Good Friday Agreement and all Ireland's communities.</p>

To add to the confusion, the next slot is to be shared by Deputies Cahill and Jim O'Callaghan, unless they have made a different arrangement.

          <p eId="para_503">Fair enough. As the Acting Chairman is aware, the history of this island is, to a large extent, dominated by our relationship with the neighbouring island and history always concentrates on moments of strife and turmoil. However, it is important to state that there have been many positive consequences of the relationship between this island and the neighbouring larger island. In the areas of entertainment, the arts, sport, business and trade unionism there is a significant level of co-operation and connectivity between the two islands and that has been mutually beneficial for all the people who live on them. Our joint membership of the European Union since the early 1970s has assisted that co-operation and connectivity. We have become closer as a result of that joint membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> It is unquestionably the case that the relationship, connectivity and co-operation between the two islands and, indeed, the two Governments, will be damaged as a result of Brexit. Nonetheless, the people of Britain voted for Brexit and their Government has entered into a withdrawal agreement with the European Union which we, as a Parliament, have ratified and to which we also agreed as a member of the European Union. However, it is important to point out that those who promoted Brexit in the debate on it in Britain, both before and immediately after the vote, stated there would be no difficulty agreeing a trade deal with the European Union. What really happened is that the people who advanced Brexit did not think about it or think of the consequences before they put that important issue to a vote of the people of the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Let us recall what happened and how we got into this current crisis. The former British Prime Minister, Theresa May, entered into a withdrawal agreement with the European Union in November 2018. She brought it back to her Parliament and was heavily criticised there. On four occasions between January and March she tried to get it through her Parliament but she failed on each occasion. She did the only thing she could and resigned in June 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The current Prime Minister took over in July 2019. What did he do? He stated that the withdrawal agreement Mrs. May had entered into with the European Union had to be changed and that he could not tolerate it. We sort of sneered at him and stated that he would not be able to change it but, in fairness, he managed to change it in a minor way. A meeting between him and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on the Wirral in October 2019 laid the pathway to a change to the withdrawal agreement. However, let us be clear as to what that change was because we all recognised it at the time. He got rid of what he referred to as the dreaded backstop but, in effect, he replaced the backstop that applied to all of the United Kingdom with a backstop that applied to Northern Ireland. We all saw that for what it was and unionist politicians in Northern Ireland were outraged that it had happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Let there be no ambiguity as to what the British Government knew it was doing in October 2019. It knew the deal into which it was entering. Subsequently, the new Prime Minister tried to get his deal through the House of Commons, but failed to do so. He sought to call a general election, did so, and succeeded in it. In January of this year, he ratified that deal before the House of Commons. However, before it was ratified, he launched an election manifesto on behalf of the Conservative Party, stating that it was a great deal, the only deal, a deal that would lead to a trade deal with the European Union. That is how the Conservatives sold it to the British public in the election in December 2019. The British public went along with it and voted for the Tories and their representation of that withdrawal agreement. He signed up to that withdrawal agreement in January 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> On 8 September this year, out of the blue, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland stated in the House of Commons that the British Government was introducing legislation that would breach the withdrawal agreement. It was extraordinary. Not only did he state that the British Government would breach the agreement, he brazenly stated in the House of Commons that the Bill was a breach of international law. There are many decent people in the United Kingdom, including many former Prime Ministers, who are outraged by this action. In fact, I think five former Prime Ministers came out to assert their disgust that the good name of the United Kingdom was being traduced as a result of this brazen and reckless act by the British Government. That is the reason we are where we are. What message does that send out? I regret to say that the message it sends to this House and, indeed, all of Europe and the rest of the world is that this is not a trustworthy British Government. That is a very serious statement for any politician to make but, I regret to say, it is true. We need to recognise that that is the case during the ongoing negotiations between the British Government and the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">We also need to ask ourselves how we will proceed with this breach of international law. The argument is made by some of the politicians in the United Kingdom that this is not yet a breach of international law because the UK Internal Market Bill has not been enacted. That is not much of a point in their defence because even the publication of that Bill, in my assessment, is a breach of the provisions of Article 12 of the Northern Ireland protocol. There are measures within Article 12 which allow the European Union to vindicate its rights under the agreement that was entered into with the United Kingdom. We will need to do that. However, let us be clear that one thing we as a country and the European Union as a union cannot do is appease lawlessness on the part of a state, irrespective of how important that state is to the European Union or how distinguished it is in its involvement with the European Union. We cannot appease lawlessness because, as I stated previously, if one appeases lawlessness, one will only encourage the lawbreaker.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Many Deputies have spoken about reunification in this House and the end of partition. That is a valid point but let us not make the same mistake about ending partition that the British made when it came to Brexit. We need to prepare for it. We need to get a team of academics together who can put forward a constitution for a new Ireland. We need to ensure we do not make the same mistakes as were made in Britain.</p>

        <speech by="#JackieCahill" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_511">In less than 100 days, the UK will be outside the EU's Single Market and customs union. From 1 January next, how we trade with the UK will be dramatically different. Even if a free trade agreement is concluded between the EU and UK, there will be significant and enduring change. Being prepared for customs formalities and a new trading relationship is critical, especially in the area of agriculture. The value of Irish agrifood products is strong and they are central to our export industry. In 2019, the sector represented approximately 10% of the value of our overall exports, at €13 billion. One third of those food exports goes to the UK. To put that in context, Irish agrifood exports to the UK in 2019 amounted to €4.4 billion. For all of mainland Europe combined, we exported another €4.5 billion. For the rest of the world, the value was just over €4 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The UK market for agrifood exports is enormous. Barriers to trade between the island of Ireland and Great Britain will be detrimental to Irish agriculture. I fear to think what a hard Brexit would do to the industry based on those numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The UK has opened trade talks with the US, and with this comes the increased threat that the US will seek lower tariffs and increased access to the UK market, including the accommodation of US production standards in areas of food safety, animal health and the environment, in other words, a Mercosur-type deal magnified many times over. The last thing Irish farmers want is a race to the bottom. A no-deal Brexit combined with these talks is a further threat in this area. Irish farmers must not be expected to reduce standards in order to gain access to a lower quality UK market. We must maintain the standards that we, as a top-quality food producing nation, are known for and proud of. Quality assurance and protected geographical indication, PGI, status are promoted by Bord Bia to highlight our top-class standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> Exports of beef amount to €2.3 billion, of which half, or 211,000 tonnes, go to the UK. Beef farmers have been hard hit by Brexit, and we now have Covid on top of it. Since the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme was introduced, it has been calculated that Brexit-related losses between May and December 2019 amounted to €160 million. The impact of Brexit and Covid losses between January and July of this year cost beef farmers a further €163 million. When one takes the Government's pandemic payment of €50 million for beef finishers into account, the total net loss incurred by beef farmers is €273 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> Last week, I met members of the north and south Tipperary Irish Farmers Association. I welcome the €5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve fund. However, this will have to be greatly scaled up to take into account the growing threat of a no-deal outcome. Other countries, such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland, also have considerable dependency on the UK market and they will be looking for a significant share of that fund. We need to ensure the closest possible trading relationship that maintains the value of the UK market for Irish farmers and, in turn, ensures the stability of the EU food market. Tariff and quota free access to the UK market is essential to ensuring this, as is a level playing field where the UK maintains current standards so that we avoid a race to the bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Some 34% of Ireland's dairy exports go to the UK, representing 53% of cheese exports, 29% of butter and 12% of skim milk powder. Exports of cheddar cheese amounted to 78,000 tonnes, representing 82% of all cheddar imported by the UK. Ireland is the only significant exporter of cheddar to Britain and the UK market is the only market of significance for Irish cheddar. Without continued access to the cheddar market in the UK, the industry would no longer be viable here.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> For milk and cream, the UK is a significant net exporter. Ireland imported over 800 million l of milk from Northern Ireland for processing. Of this amount, approximately 120 million l were sold as fresh milk, accounting for 25% of Ireland's fresh milk market.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> Retention of tariff-free access to the UK market is critically important, particularly for Irish cheddar exports. Overall, the loss of access to the UK market could have a serious destabilising impact on the value of the Irish dairy sector. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding the future trading relationship between the UK and EU presents a particular threat to the current highly integrated all-Ireland milk processing structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The UK is a key market. There are other potential markets that we must gain access to, such as China, which will allow for the continued, sustainable future production of high-quality produce. The development of the independent-owned meat plant in Banagher could help make this a reality. If we let independently owned factories into the market and grow our agricultural business links with the Chinese market, we will benefit Irish beef farmers on a number of fronts while offsetting some of the negative impacts of Brexit. A new player with access to the Chinese market must be fully supported by all State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> This morning, I organised a Zoom meeting with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and representatives of Bulmers in Clonmel. Bulmers, with its plant in Clonmel town, is a large employer in my constituency. There are also apple farms and transportation services associated with this business. The company adds enormous value to the local community annually, employs large numbers of people and pays €1.6 million in rates to the county council. Brexit is a massive threat to this business. Approximately 50% of the Clonmel plant's output is exported to the UK. Beer is facing a 0% tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit, whereas cider faces the equivalent of 10p per pint. This is unequal competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> A no-deal Brexit would be detrimental to the work of the Clonmel plant and could well result in its relocation to the UK. Bulmers parent company C&amp;C already has a significant plant in the UK and a no-deal Brexit with high tariffs could see this business move out of Tipperary and Ireland to the UK. We cannot afford to let this happen to industries such as Bulmers and others which would be similarly affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> We must protect Irish agrifood standards, prevent a race to the bottom, ensure tariff and quota-free trading with the UK and protect our place in the market. We must look to other high-quality, well-paying markets such as China to offset the negative impacts of Brexit. Businesses such as Bulmers are too large to lose. These businesses need assistance.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">During the past six months, we have been faced with probably the greatest challenge this country has faced in our lifetime. The Covid-19 pandemic continues to be the focus of our efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">It has taken a very heavy toll in lives but also on our day-to-day lives, the economy and society. This is a battle we are winning and one I hope we will look back on and learn from.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> In the midst of this, we still have to deal with Brexit, which, unfortunately, has not gone away. We did not vote for it, and nor did our neighbours in Northern Ireland, but it is a most serious issue for the island of Ireland and one we must deal with. I fear the UK Government's approach makes a no-deal Brexit a certainty. I have continually warned about this but was told time and again that we had an agreement in place, the Northern Ireland protocol, which would protect us here on the island of Ireland. Sadly, I fear the UK Government will not honour the commitments it made.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Coming from a Border county, I know the devastating effects that Brexit will have if we do not put in place the necessary measures to deal with it. There are still many unanswered questions on Brexit. I am deeply concerned that its impact on a Border town like Dundalk could be potentially disastrous. I am worried about the lack of clarity on a range of issues. The UK Government has shown arrogance in its approach, for example, in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol. We might ask what this says about its general approach to these negotiations. </p>
          <p eId="para_530"> I am also worried about the lack of information available to businesses. I often hear from Border businesses that they still do not know what is happening. Among the questions they ask are whether there will be a hard border; if there will be a customs checks at the Border; what will happen with tariffs; how cross-Border workers will be treated; how standards will be implemented; and whether cross-Border agencies continue to exist? The list of questions is endless. </p>
          <p eId="para_531"> We still do not have a clue about what will happen once Brexit is implemented, particularly in the event of a no-deal Brexit. We are sleepwalking into this. We still do not have a roadmap for businesses in the event of no deal. We hear constantly there will be no hard border, no issue for cross-Border workers and no customs checks at the Border, but how can we insist this is the case when we have no roadmap in the event that there is no deal?</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I have no doubt the UK Government's arrogance is a negotiation tactic but I deal with people and businesses which cannot afford to play these political games. The people of the Border counties of Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal need real answers now so that they can prepare properly for Brexit. The Government's advice for business is that when the transition period ends, Brexit is likely to affect how they do business. Businesses are advised to review their supply chain, understand the rules for importing from and exporting to Britain, and review all their regulations, licensing and certification requirements. This is a case of stating the obvious. Businesses know they have to do this but what they need are facts. They are still in the dark about how things will operate in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A real roadmap for a no-deal outcome must be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Notwithstanding that we did not vote for it, Brexit will happen and we must prepare for the worst-case scenario of a no-deal outcome. We must not be used as a pawn in the negotiations between the EU and the UK. We must be given a clear commitment that Ireland will be protected in all negotiations between the EU and the UK. We have seen how the backstop was dropped, despite assurances it would protect us on the island of Ireland. We cannot be weak on this. I urge the Minister to protect Ireland's interests at all times. </p>
          <p eId="para_534"> The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. The withdrawal agreement has allowed a transition period up to 31 December 2020. The UK has said it will not extend this transition period. I have some specific questions. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, will there be a hard border on the island of Ireland? What will the hard border be like? Will all goods be checked at the Border? What plans has the Government made for customs checks in the event of a hard border? These are the questions that businesses along the Border, in towns such as Dundalk, ask me. They need clarity not vague replies that do not give real answers. I ask the Minister to be specific. If he does not have the answers, I ask that he say so. It is better for businesses that they know where they stand and that they can then plan for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> There is concern about how cross-Border workers will be treated. What plans are in place in the event of a no-deal Brexit? How will workers travelling from Dundalk to the North and <i>vice versa</i> be affected? I am asked these questions by people who are worried that they will be stopped at the Border, their commuting time will be extended and their daily lives interrupted. Will their driving licences and car insurance still be valid in both jurisdictions? We need clarity on these questions. What arrangements are been made for students in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Will students on both sides of the Border retain the rights they now enjoy? Will student supports remain the same? Will students from Northern Ireland still be treated in the same way if there is no deal? Dundalk's very successful institute of technology has a considerable number of students from Northern Ireland. How would a no-deal Brexit affect them? </p>
          <p eId="para_536"> Mobile phones and roaming are also a cause for concern among people living in the Border area. Will current roaming charges be maintained if there is no deal? What will happen with cross-Border healthcare in the event of a no-deal Brexit? We work very closely with our Northern counterparts in the provision of healthcare services. Will the cross-Border healthcare initiatives still be in place after Brexit? Will this continue if there is no deal? </p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Hauliers who travel daily to the UK are worried. They are completely in the dark and hear media reports that there will be massive queues at UK ports. We must provide complete clarity to businesses and citizens on what Brexit will bring to them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_538">It is incredible that an Opposition group is getting to speak after 20 Government Deputies have spoken. The latter have access to their Ministers at their parliamentary party meetings, yet we are pushed so far back in these discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> An trí rud is dainséaraí amuigh: éadan tairbh, deireadh staile, focail Shasanaigh. The three most dangerous things in life are the front of a bull, the back of a stallion and the words of an Englishman, according to the old Irish saying. I do not want to impugn the words of every Englishman. English people, like all peoples across the world, are largely decent. However, the word of the British Government has been, to Ireland's massive misfortune, meaningless and worthless. The reneging of the British Government in this case is not an outlier. In fact, it has been a deeply ingrained characteristic of British foreign policy towards Ireland for hundreds of years. </p>
          <p eId="para_540"> The instinct of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments in international relations has always been to be soft and gentle. That may be fine with many of our international colleagues but it is incorrect as a response to the British given all we know of Britain's inability to adhere to its agreements and commitments. The Government's response is feeble and weak. Plenty of words have been spoken but the cost to this country of the reneging by the British has not been communicated in strong enough terms to the British Government. Where is the pressure on the British Government with regard to Tory brinkmanship and lawlessness? The Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement. Surely breaking or damaging that agreement should have significant international consequences and sanctions. I do not mean trade sanctions but some level of diplomatic and political sanctions against Britain for its approach on this. It is time for the Irish Government to flex its diplomatic and international muscles.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> We hear a new British ambassador is coming to Ireland. Has he been summoned to Government Buildings to discuss the anger here over the British Government's actions? Previous speakers referred to the goodwill that exists in the United States. The US special envoy has warned against a hard border but has the Irish Government spoken directly to the US special envoy? The US Secretary of State previously lauded the vitality of the Good Friday Agreement but where is the pressure on the US Secretary of State? This is an election year, which gives this country an opportunity to leverage Irish America. Why has the Taoiseach not spoken to the US President about ensuring that any future US trade agreement with Britain is contingent on the Good Friday Agreement being protected? Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Congressmen Peter King, Brendan Boyle and Richard Neal have all sounded the alarm written to the Tory Government on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">However, where is the pressure on the rest of the international community to ensure that it stands up for the rule of international law in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> The actions of the Tory Government show in flashing neon lights the fact that it continues to exert influence on the future of this country. Is it not incredible that, 104 years after the 1916 Rising, our ability to travel, do business and trade in the Thirty-two Counties is directly influenced by the Tory Party, a party that knows nothing about this country and does not care about this country whatsoever? I believe strongly that the idea of Irish self-determination is as important now as it was in 1916, but the people of the North of Ireland self-determined in favour of the Good Friday Agreement. They self-determined in favour of remaining within the EU. The Tories took that decision and threw it in the waste paper basket. Are we going to stand idly by and let that happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> I believe that the Minister has a natural instinct towards the logic of full Irish self-determination, independence and unity. I would say that the Minister also has an instinct of cautiousness. I understand that it is logical to take a cautious approach to this particular issue, but cautiousness towards Irish unity must have a limit. There must be some logical point at which the political chaos created by the Tories in our country actually triggers some response by our elected politicians to start to work towards Irish unity. I am still shocked that the Taoiseach has resiled from that great traditional objective of generations in Fianna Fáil of Irish unity, but the rest of the Government should not do likewise. In light of what the Tories are doing and as some type of sanction on that, I call on the Government to open talks on a new all-Ireland forum where civic and political sections of society throughout the Thirty-two Counties can sit down together and start to discuss how to ameliorate the worst aspects of Brexit and work towards unity. It is really important that we not let this situation continue. The Tories in London continue to affect negatively our ability to run this country. It was not good enough in 1916 and it certainly is not good enough now.</p>

          <p eId="para_546">I will take six and a half minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> I welcome the Minister to the House. To be clear, he has been anything but silent, feeble or weak on this issue, and nor have the Government, Opposition parties in the House and our colleagues in the EU. Each and every one of those colleagues backs what we are saying, namely, that Britain must abide by the agreement it signed. The EU unambiguously and with total clarity fully supports this Government and the people on this island in their wish for peace and in their consent to the future relationship that we must have between North and South. This point must be made, notwithstanding what my colleague, Deputy Tóibín, said. The relationship between the EU and Britain is now sundered. As such, it is important that no matter what else happens, we ensure that Brexit, which will happen and we cannot change, is as soft as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> To measure the significance and influence of the Irish Government and our civil servants, one need have done no more than listen to the former British ambassador to the United States of America on radio this morning when he said that Ireland had a punch far above its weight and had major influence in America. One of the presidential candidates, Vice President Joe Biden, and Ms Nancy Pelosi, who is a senior political leader in America, are clear that the withdrawal agreement is a fundamental issue and the protocol on Northern Ireland must remain sacrosanct in every event.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> I have been appointed by the Government as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We have not met as yet, but we will do so next week. Along with my colleague, Deputy McHugh, I today participated in a discussion on Zoom with Lord Kinnoull, Chairman of the EU committee of the House of Lords. We made clear our views, which represented the views of every Deputy, about what was happening. Nevertheless, we listened to what Lord Kinnoull had to say. We fully support the idea that he put to us, namely, that there should be much more communication between Members of the Dáil and Members of the British Houses of Parliament. The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, has been of considerable importance in the past and will have increasing significance in future. Although it will be for our committee to decide, we might communicate regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> One thing the Covid crisis has done is give us the capacity to meet people from distant shores as well as not so far away more frequently on the Internet. That is exactly what we will do so as to put forth the views and strong opinions of Members of the Oireachtas, including the view that the new relationship - there will be one regardless as a result of Brexit - between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the South will require us to put a great deal more thought into what will happen in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> The British Government is in no doubt whatsoever of our strongly held and immovable views on the Northern Ireland protocol. There is no other way - there can be no diminution and there will be none as far as we are concerned. The British Government must think again. The British Parliament has every right to legislate for what happens therein, but it cannot break an international agreement willy-nilly. It cannot decide to throw up a red flag against something to which it has already signed. The UK's international reputation is at stake, not just with Europe or America, but with other countries that it hopes to have business relationships with in future. I speak in particular of China and other major blocs.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> This debate will clearly point out to the UK and its Government exactly where we all stand on this matter. We will have no truck with the breaking of the protocol. No one on this island wants to go back to the way things were. We do not want to go back to the violence, the sadness and the awful 30 years of murder and mayhem on this island, North and South. We do not want customs or Border posts on our island between North and South. We do not want to see the appalling vista of commercial relationships between companies, large and small, on our two islands breaking down. We have important personal relationships with the UK outside of our business and political relationships. We do not want to see them sundered or changed in any way. The British Government must change its proposals on the protocol and uphold in full everything contained in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> Like my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, I am a Border Deputy and I want to see the peace that was restored to County Louth and elsewhere along the Border continue. The benefits of the Good Friday Agreement, for example, co-operation in education and so on, must continue. There is only one way forward on this island and that is with all of us working together.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul McAuliffe<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_554">The Good Friday Agreement brought an end to a violent conflict by settling and putting in place the constitutional arrangements on these islands. The peace process involved compromises on all sides. It involved different building blocks from different parties to the dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">After centuries of action to the contrary, the British Government stated in the Downing Street Declaration that Britain had no "selfish strategic or economic interest" in Northern Ireland. This was an essential foundation for what was to follow. It enabled a confidence in the Irish people that led them to agree to the principle of consent and to remove our constitutional claim to Northern Ireland. For 20 years, people in the North have lived under this settlement and British-Irish relations have normalised. There are people alive on this island today as a consequence of the settlement who would otherwise not be. We have peace on our island and we have goods and services flowing freely across both parts of it. Brexit has changed this dynamic but the obligations of previous international treaties continue to bind all parties, including the British Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> For the past year and especially in recent weeks, the British Government has indeed demonstrated a selfish strategic and economic interest in Northern Ireland. There is no doubting it. Now the British Government is playing games with the peace process itself. By seeking to pull out the foundation block that is the Downing Street Declaration, it is playing Brexit Jenga with the Good Friday Agreement. The Northern Ireland protocol ratified in January provides that the North will come under the EU's customs code and Single Market rules. It prevents a hard border. The Single Market ensures a level playing field for businesses in the EU to trade without tariffs. Would that level playing field still be as level if the UK, from outside the Union, were to give state subsidies to its businesses, allow products produced at a lower standard into the EU market or have workers employed on poorer conditions? Giving the UK access to the Single Market without some checks on state aid and standards would not just be a bad deal; it would leave all EU companies at an unfair disadvantage in their own Single Market.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I remind those in the UK who believe that the conditions required of the EU in respect of Northern Ireland undermine the integrity of the UK or infringe on its sovereignty that the North of Ireland is not North Yorkshire and Foyleside is not Tyneside. Until 1998, the North was a disputed territory. Sovereignty is one thing but when competing sovereign claims rub up against each other, they create friction. The EU and the Good Friday Agreement were tools designed to prevent such friction and to maintain peace. The unpredictable nature of British politics and the changing demographics on this island mean that a border poll may be on our agenda sooner than we imagined it might be when we ratified the Good Friday Agreement. The Republic, at civic and governmental levels, is ill prepared at this time to begin the vital debate around unity that is needed before we even contemplate a border poll and the related referendum in the South. A border poll will trigger a multiplicity of questions and debates about how we share this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> We need to prepare for that debate and for how we see a new way of sharing this island. How do we envisage the Six Counties on our island that have been governed by a different regime for 100 years relating to the other 26? How will people on both parts of the island access health and education services? How will we decide the areas that will benefit from inward investment? How will we avoid another tribal conflict, the previous one having been the almost inevitable consequence of the original crude sectarian division? What are the necessary conditions we want to see for the unification of our country? How do we ensure that unionists and loyalists, who do not have an Irish identity and cherish their own identity, do not fear a shared island and can see themselves as part of the outcome of a unification and sharing process? How do we avoid a situation where a narrow victory for unity in a future border poll inevitably provokes instability in communities where a majority or large minority of people do not want it? There are many such questions that remain unanswered. The process of addressing them will shape the thinking in the Republic as much as it will enlighten people in the North as to the reality of what a shared island means.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Fianna Fáil is ready to lead that process. We want a united Ireland but we also want a unified people. We want everybody on this island to be unified around shared values that are not about a fourth green field but, rather, sharing our labour and sharing the fruits of all our fields. The challenge set out in Wolfe Tone's vision is to bring the people of this island together. Never has a generation needed to hear that message more. As we prepare for the coming changes, we must remind ourselves to follow Wolfe Tone and not to be tone deaf to the views of the other people who share this island. The challenge for this generation is to take the settlement offered by the peace process and to decide how our island, within Europe, will look post Brexit.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">The Covid pandemic has shown up weaknesses in our society in respect of the housing crisis, workers' rights, ICU bed ratios and so on. In case anybody thought Irish history had stopped in 1998, Boris Johnson's handling of Brexit has shown why his country was sometimes called "perfidious Albion". We know that the provisions of the UK Internal Market Bill and the circumventing of the Irish protocol would serve to cut out part of the Good Friday Agreement. I do not accept that the agreement is the final answer to the question as regards sovereignty. Rather, it was a stop in the road which enabled us to create a scenario in the North where people could work with each other, we could have cross-Border co-operation and we could deal with the east-west relationship. As republicans, we never stood back from our belief that Irish unity is the long-term solution for a better Ireland. We have been proved correct in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> At this point in time, we can only wonder why Boris Johnson is doing what he is doing. Is it a diversionary tactic? Is it about what he says it is about, namely, the difficulties in regard to the connection between Britain and the North? Is it a diversion from his less than perfect handling of the Covid pandemic? Is it a diversion from the serious discussions that must happen in regard to the level playing field on state aid and fisheries? We do not know. All we know is that he has taken a risk with Irish lives, Irish business and Irish society, North and South, and we cannot accept it. We need the EU and Michel Barnier's team to stand firm. The things Nancy Pelosi, Richard Neal and others have said are very welcome but the Government must maintain whatever pressure it can on all our international contacts to ensure we get the best mitigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> We must be clear about the situation as it stands. We need to take Boris Johnson and some other members of the Conservative Party at their word and assume they will do exactly as they say they will do and that there are no internal checks within Westminster or anywhere else to stop them. I have yet to see a situation where any such checks have curtailed what I can only describe as British madness on certain issues over many years. The reality is that we are going to be left in a situation where there is only one mitigation that can make a significant difference to the lives of a huge number of people on this island, including those living in my part of the country, and that is Irish unity. This is not the way anyone expected the conversation to happen. It is not what we wanted to happen. Farmers and hauliers in places like Dromiskin, Knockbridge, Dundalk, Cullyhanna and Cullybackey are not being benefitted by these particular moves of Boris Johnson and his colleagues. The latter do not particularly care about that and we need to recognise this reality. We need to make preparations in regard to Irish unity, accepting that we may get a deal and there may be a free trade agreement between Britain and the EU. We may have the protections of the Irish protocol but we cannot be sure of it. In the long term, we cannot, for want of a better phrase, be under the cosh of what a British Government might decide to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">We call for preparations for Irish unity and what it would look like. I have no difficulty with the previous speaker's comments. We need to have an holistic conversation, and it is not necessarily the united Ireland that I would have seen when I was 16 or 17. We have to make room for unionists and all the people who live on the island. Ireland has a far more diverse population than was the case back then. We need the Citizens' Assembly to be convened, we need governmental plans, we need discussions and we need to make sure. The reality is that people will be left in a situation where they decide to either stay in an absolutely dysfunctional, so-called United Kingdom or go with the option of the European Union and Irish unity. This could be the end of what has been a not necessarily beneficial history involving Britain and Ireland, especially for the people of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">Recent developments in the UK regarding the Internal Market Bill have exposed just how vulnerable Ireland remains in the evolving and unpredictable nature of the Brexit drama. We are aware that the EU has expressed a willingness to engage in legal action against the UK because of the position it has adopted. This approach, while understandable, will add to the delays and the sense of conflict that continues to dominate the end stage of current negotiations. This is why, unfortunately, a hard, no-deal Brexit looks like a very real possibility. We are simply running out of time. Such an eventuality will have a devastating impact on Ireland and especially on the rural economy. According to Teagasc, this version of Brexit will cause a loss of preferential market access to the UK, as well as leading to a decline in Irish-EU exports to the UK. To compensate for this and to compensate for the damage the resulting economic shock will bring about, we need to ensure - as Teagasc has noted - that Irish export options are diversified. This has to be a particular priority because it is expected that Irish agriculture output volume will decline due to lower farm prices. We must work to create alternative market options. The opening of new trade opportunities must be a top priority. Without this, rural Ireland and, by extension, the entire Irish economy will enter a period of profound difficulties that might take a generation to resolve.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_565">I thank the Minister for staying on for the full debate. It is rare to see that happening in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I attended the annual general meeting of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation in the Maritime Hotel, Bantry, last Saturday in order to educate myself on the crisis that Brexit will be for our fishing industry. Brexit has created fallout for the industry and it is already visible with a huge increase in numbers of foreign boats and their increased efforts in Ireland's exclusive economic zone, EEZ. Irish vessels have traditionally fished primarily in waters of the north west around Rockall, off the Scottish Isles and in the Irish Sea and the Celtic Sea. Following Brexit, we will lose some 50% of our fishing grounds. Irish fishing trawlers have few or no rights in the North Sea, in the English Channel or in Portuguese or Spanish waters. Our fishermen are prevented from this due to not having a history of doing so when Ireland joined the EU. They had no historical landings to show because they caught as much as was needed in UK and Irish waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> A no-deal Brexit will force all EU vessels from UK waters, which is estimated at 400 vessels. In contrast, Ireland's entire fleet of 18 m vessels is only 170. This possible invasion of displaced EU vessels means certain damage to the biologically sensitive area where fish come to spawn and where juveniles feed and grow before they swim away to other waters. For the past two years, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation has requested an evaluation by seeking scientific advice to calculate the maximum displacement a biologically sensitive area could accept before the sustainability of stock is damaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> We wish to also seek from our competent authority a comprehensive list of which other EU vessels have historical rights to fish in Ireland's EEZ. A 2018 report by the fisheries ecosystems advisory service of the Marine Institute, which was commissioned by the previous Minister, Deputy Creed, reported that the Irish free register showed that in 2006 there were more than 280 vessels of a length greater than 18 m. Today, there are fewer than 180. Our fear is that Brexit could trigger another decommissioning programme. This would be the death knell for many of our small coastal fishing villages and offshore islands, and the few remaining family-owned businesses. Some fishermen will be affected more than others, but no evaluation has been carried out to identify what vessels will be the most affected, especially those who are heavily dependent on access and quota share in UK waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> The money promised by the previous Government in response to the fallout from Brexit was €14 million. Using the example of the effort made in response to the devastating effect of Covid-19 in the second quarter of this year following the collapse of markets, an amount of €190,050 was paid to more than 1,400 vessel owners. If shared out equally, this would be less than €150 each. The industry has learned that a substantial commitment has been made to the French fishing industry, including a substantial sum for each vessel affected. A figure of €800,000 each has been mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> The fish stocks of Ireland are a national asset, managed by the Minister with responsibility for the marine. The Minister is legally obliged under EU law to treat each fisherman fairly and, under proportionality, to distribute resources fairly and with clear, transparent policies while not favouring one sector above another. This will never be as important as in the period following Brexit. This requirement of proportionality will be crucial following Brexit, so that no section will be forced out of the industry while another gets richer due to a geographical location.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> Coastal communities and the tens of thousands of people employed in the processing and service sector must be protected. Fishermen and their organisation must be partners with the Government bodies if they are to survive. The demersal white fish fleet must be protected. Some vessels in this sector catch up to 70% of their fish, which makes up to 80% of their earnings, from the fish they catch in UK waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> I shall give one example of how fleets' fishing activities will be affected by Brexit. One of the most important species to our demersal fleet is nephrops. This species includes Dublin Bay prawns. These fish do not migrate to other areas, they live in burrows on the seabed. The Smalls ground is one of the areas our vessels fish that is in UK waters. In the past decades hundreds of thousands of euro has been invested in Irish fishing vessels to adapt them into freezer vessels to gain a maximum return for this highly-valued species, and diverting them from the gadoid fisheries, thus allowing us in the industry to manage the quotas and give a fair opportunity to all to earn their living.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> We all know that a no-deal Brexit is bad for Ireland on many fronts but none more so than those relating to fisheries, agriculture and the cross-border health scheme. We can point the finger at the UK full on if it pulls out with no deal in place. The Government can, however, put in certain measures on the cross-border directive whereby thousands of people have travelled from the South to the North of Ireland for hip, knee and cataract surgeries. Some 2,000 people from Cork and Kerry have travelled to Belfast. Tomorrow night, the 58th bus will travel to Belfast for people to have eyesight-saving surgery. This cannot stop. These people are genuinely losing their eyesight. Every day delayed leads to these people seeing less and less. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, councillors Ben Dalton O'Sullivan and Danny Collins and I have organised these buses in what is our only hope to save the eyesight of these people. I would be delighted if the proposed new clinic in Cork materialises, but it could take two years to complete. Until that happens, I call on the Minister to let the House know today how the legislation is progressing to ensure that the cross-border scheme continues, as the previous Minister indicated that it would last year when I raised the matter with him. We must remember, whether we like it or not, that Northern Ireland is still across the Border. Many health agreements, for example, those involving cancer patients in Donegal travelling north and babies in Belfast with heart issues coming to Dublin, must remain in place. We need to know from the Minister if the cross-border scheme for the South to the North will continue. What is being put in place for this to happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Last month, we took a 36 year old woman, Maeve, from the Minister and Taoiseach's constituency who had been advised by the Taoiseach's constituency office to go up on our buses, as there was no way that the 20-minute surgery could take place in Cork or anywhere in the south of Ireland before she went blind.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Maeve is in the middle of a celebration in her life and I intend to take her for surgery on her other eye in the weeks ahead so that she can get her life back to normal. We cannot play games here. I have seen people who were blind have their sight restored in Belfast. If the cross-border directive ends on 31 December, it will have devastating consequences for people in Cork and Kerry. Again, has the necessary legislation been drawn up to protect the scheme for the next number of years or will people from Cork and Kerry go blind on this Government's watch?</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> In the time remaining, I wish to return to fishing which is going through a very difficult time. Fishing communities are very angry and the statutory instrument that the Taoiseach signed a few weeks ago is a hammer blow to the industry. I ask the Minister to imagine not being on the road on a particular evening and then receiving a letter saying that he has incurred penalty points. He then proves that he was not on the road and should not have received penalty points but those points stay on his licence. How in the name of God can any Taoiseach in his right mind sign something without at least making some amendments to try to safeguard the fishing industry? Brexit is kicking them and the statutory instrument signed by a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach is kicking them. We need to protect this industry. We also need to protect our agricultural industry although I do not have time to go into that now. I ask the Minister to give us some insight into the position regarding the cross-border directive.</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickCostello" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Patrick Costello<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_577">We are less than 100 days away from the end of the Brexit transition period. If we look at the struggles, brinkmanship and ill-preparedness on the part of the United Kingdom in its negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, it is no surprise that we are once again in a situation where all we have as we approach the precipice is a lack of certainty and clarity about where we are going. Everyone in this House has spoken about the potentially enormous impact of Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit, on a variety of areas. In this House and this country, we are all very alive to realities of how detrimental Brexit might be but unfortunately some of our neighbours seem to revel in the prospect of Brexit, despite the fact that it will be nothing but calamitous.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> I want to focus on the areas of food and environmental standards. As I said, Brexit is far-reaching and leaches into so many different areas but I want to highlight my concerns regarding food and environmental standards. The United Kingdom Internal Market Bill includes clauses that would give Westminster power to compel the Northern Ireland Assembly to accept certain environmental and food standards as well as animal welfare standards. This goes against Britain's own policy of devolution and against the Good Friday Agreement, which allows for self-determination and self-governance of Northern Ireland by the people of Northern Ireland. At this late stage we still have no idea what sanitary and phytosanitary regime the UK will employ. This is a fundamental concern for us in the context of our ability to export and import food as well as in terms of fair trading standards and environmental standards. If there is a softening by the UK on these issues, it is going to be a problem for us because nature does not give a damn about any line on a map. We are one small island with one shared biosphere. Anything that happens up there is going to affect us down here and<i> vice versa</i>. We have a continuous and inseparable ecosystem on this island so whatever happens with a border, be it hard or soft, damage done on one side will leak over and affect the other side. This is going to cause all sorts of problems as we struggle with environmental protection and climate change and also in terms of the level playing field that was supposed to be part of this agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> It is estimated that between 80% and 90% of the UK's environmental law came from the EU and with 25% of all EU legislation estimated to relate to environmental protection, the British are going to be throwing out a hell of a lot of legislation. What is going to replace it? We do not know at this late stage. The UK Government has repeatedly stated that it will not lower environmental standards once the UK has left the EU but we need to see a commitment to no regression in its domestic legislation and in any agreement that we end up signing at the end of this 100 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Many Deputies have highlighted the fact that Brexit will have a profoundly negative impact on our agrifood sector. Despite growth in new markets, the UK remains our single largest trading partner and anything that impacts our ability to trade, whether that is changing rules, back sliding or as one Deputy said earlier, the actions of perfidious Albion, is going to undermine our agrifood sector, which needs to be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The programme for Government contains commitments to a shared island and a new unit has been set up in the Department of the Taoiseach. It is time that we heard an update from the Taoiseach on the work that is happening there. Ireland, North and South, is very different from how it was in 1998 and 1969. Looking to the ghosts of the past is not going to help us to chart a way forward. We need to come together and talk about how we are going to live on this small shared island, this shared biosphere where the impact of Brexit will be enormous, north and south of the Border.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiamhSmyth" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy Niamh Smyth<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_582">In fewer than 100 days, the UK will be outside the EU's Single Market and customs union. I wish to compliment the Minister on his steady hand in bringing the country through these negotiations. As someone from a border county and constituency I know that no one is more fearful than people living in border areas and we appreciate the Minister's tough but steady hand throughout these negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> From 1 January 2021, the way we trade with the UK will be dramatically different. Even if a free trade agreement is concluded between the EU and UK, there will be significant and enduring changes. It is vital that all businesses, regardless of size, focus on their Brexit readiness as things will not be simple and will not stay the same. Being prepared for customs formalities is critical. Regardless of the outcome of the future relationship negotiations, the provisions of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland will apply. This protects the peace process and avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland - there is nobody more acutely aware of that than those living in the Border counties - while preserving the integrity of the EU customs union and Single Market and Ireland's place therein. Under the protocol, the EU's customs code and other EU provisions necessary to preserve the integrity of the Single Market will continue to apply in Northern Ireland. This ensures that Northern Ireland will have free and open access to the Single Market.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The United Kingdom Internal Market Bill which gives British Ministers the power to override parts of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol relating to Northern Ireland and Ireland that was agreed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland last year is a complete breach of the aforementioned agreement and of international law. The Bill, in its current form, must be withdrawn. It is welcome that the EU will not allow the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill and other legislation which could undermine the protocol to be used as negotiating currency by the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> The all-island economy is important to businesses across the island of Ireland, now more than ever. Protecting that economy has been and will continue to be a major priority for successive Governments. We have a good story to tell about doing business on the island, the benefits of an all-island economy and the current and future business opportunities on the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">In the past two decades, the developing all-Ireland economy has benefited businesses in terms of improved scale and greater efficiency. This has happened because of the improvements brought about by peace, stability and, of course, invisible borders for goods, services, labour and finance. There is now a high degree of integration of the economies, North and South, including supply chains and trade in intermediate products. North-South co-operation and cross-border trade has grown significantly in the years since the Good Friday Agreement, strengthening and growing prosperity across the island of Ireland, and has supported the development of an all-Ireland economy which both supports and is supported by the peace process. </p>
          <p eId="para_587"> As somebody who grew up at the height of the Troubles, I am aware that the landscape and streetscape of towns in Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh are very different from what they were when we were growing up. That is certainly not something we want to return to. Fundamentally, this is about peace, reconciliation and prosperity. </p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement and must continue. From the beginning, Ireland's approach has been guided by the guiding principle of securing a deal that works for Northern Ireland and the island as a whole. We found an agreed way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the aim of avoiding a hard border, recognising the common travel area and protecting the Single Market and Ireland's place within it. This is what the protocol does and it is vital the protocol is implemented in full and in good faith. </p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Lakeland Dairies is a major dairy processing co-operative. One of its major plants is in Bailieborough, where I live, and it is a huge employer in the area. It operates in 19 counties across the northern half of the island, including the North of Ireland, processing some 1.8 billion l of milk annually and exporting large volumes of dairy produce to the UK, Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and other international markets worldwide. The group is a leading provider of dairy produce to Ireland's Kerrygold brand.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The dairy industry is one of agrifood sectors with the greatest exposure to the consequences of Brexit, with about one third of North of Ireland milk crossing the Border for processing. The CEO of Lakeland Dairies, Mr. Michael Hanley, has stressed the impact of Brexit on business, including extra cost, reductions in profit and business inefficiency. He has also outlined a number of key concerns with regard to the dairy industry, particularly focused on cross-Border supply chains. This is particularly important to Lakeland Dairies as milk processing capacity in Northern Ireland falls short of demand, meaning milk produced in Northern Ireland must be brought south for processing. In this context, Lakeland Dairies stresses its support for the Northern Ireland protocol and its desire to see it implemented in full, including in regard to all-Ireland strategic policy committee, SPC, scheme frameworks. However, these cross-border supply chains mean that, under rules of origin, it becomes a mixed product, meaning it may not qualify for export under foreign trade agreements. Lakeland Dairies considers it imperative that they continue to qualify for these foreign trade agreements. In addition, Lakeland Dairies stresses the need for continued access to market price mitigation schemes and for tariff-free access to Great Britain for Northern Ireland milk processed in Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_591"> To conclude, there are very tough weeks ahead and they will have huge consequences for Ireland. I will be biased and say this is true for the Border counties in particular. I ask that the Minister's work would continue in order to ensure we see invisible and seamless borders, the common travel area and all of the hugely important parts of the Good Friday Agreement kept in their entirety, to ensure that peace and stability continue on this island. </p>

          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_592">I thank the Minister for his contribution, which I listened to from my office, and I thank him for waiting to listen to the debate. I am supportive of his and the Government's stance on the need to maintain the best possible relationship with the UK. Regardless of what happens at the end of this year, that relationship will be ongoing. It is not just about 1 January 2021, it is about 2 January and 3 January of 2021, 2022 and 2023. I believe we need cool heads and measured responses that are firm and unshakeable and rooted in the knowledge that we are supported by the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, which, as the Minister rightly emphasised, is upheld even in the event of a no-deal Brexit. We are supported by the EU and the US, where many senior politicians, such as Nancy Pelosi, Richard Neal and Joe Biden, have given their support to upholding the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> Our strength comes from the agreements we have negotiated between the EU and the UK, with significant input from Dublin and the European Parliament. Our strength is firmly rooted in the support of our EU and international colleagues. That is why I believe our responses have to be considered ones, because verbal onslaughts will serve little purpose except to widen gaps and undermine our future relationships with the EU. Governments come and go, but relationships are between people and businesses and they should not be damaged by either hasty or ill-chosen words. Yes, there is criticism within the UK from former Prime Ministers but they are family. We are neighbours. We are in a different position to the UK. We should play to our strengths and not play their games. That is what the Government is doing, and I support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> None of that takes away from the critical juncture at which we find ourselves and, of course, that is exacerbated by the recent UK Internal Market Bill. As my speaking time is limited, I am going to make three points and pose a number of questions. If the Minister does not have time to answer them today, which he probably will not, I ask that written answers be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> First, the issue of the UK land bridge has been raised by many Deputies and I will not repeat their words. Nonetheless, I strongly agree with the concerns raised around the absolute need to increase direct sailings to the EU, not just to the French ports, but also to ports in northern Europe, like Antwerp or Hamburg. Has any thought been given to using direct sailings from Northern Ireland to northern European ports and, if so, what progress has been made? Dublin Port is very important but Rosslare and, to a lesser extent, Waterford and Cork, have a significant role to play. One point that needs to be considered is not just the number of sailings, but the turnaround time. For example, if ships have to sail by Rosslare on their way to Dublin, that is an extra one to two hours each way, which significantly adds to turnaround time. We need to take a regional view, from the perspective of expediency and efficiency but also from the perspective of serving exporters and importers throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> My second concern is around the sheep and beef sectors, which are of national importance but are especially critical in the Border regions and, of course, underpin much of the rural economy. As 250,000 tonnes of beef go from Ireland to the UK every year, any imposition of tariffs would totally undermine that trade and would collapse the market. I have several questions. First, the UK exports 100,000 tonnes of beef to the EU. In the event of a disorderly Brexit, the UK will not be able to export significant amounts of beef to the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The Minister is probably very aware that the British beef industry is pushing its Government to cut down on imports from Ireland, Botswana and Poland under the guise of meeting climate targets. Either of these scenarios, or both, could unfold. In those circumstances, what plans or preparations have been made to fill that potential gap for beef in the EU market?</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> With regard to the awful event of the possible imposition of WTO tariffs, will the Minister confirm whether tariffs are significantly lower on live exports to the UK or Northern Ireland than on exports of slaughtered animals as cuts of meat? Will the Minister verify that? If it is the case, have we considered the opportunities that might present? I am aware that we lose significant value in those circumstances but have we considered it as a stopgap measure? </p>
          <p eId="para_599"> We have introduced supports such as the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, and beef finisher pandemic payments but the estimated losses in this sector as a result of Covid and Brexit come to €273 million. While this is not the direct responsibility of the Minister, Brexit has a significant impact on that sector and I make a strong plea for further supports in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> With regard to the sheep sector, there is a significant export trade between North and South. I have been told that every ewe in Northern Ireland would have to have three lambs to account for all of the sheep that travel across the Border. If the British Government does not adhere to the rules on a level playing field, and it has not yet brought forward its proposals, with regard to food standards, animal health, sanitary and phytosanitary regulations and so on, is the Minister confident that we will be able to ensure Ireland does not become a back door to the EU - it is important to remember that includes us - for UK sheep meat or any other food products that do not adhere to these standards? Will the Minister clarify what is likely to happen to all of the sheep meat we import from New Zealand given that the tonnage of sheep meat agreed was based largely on imports to the UK? What has been put in place to deal with that?</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> My final issue relates to the day-to-day nitty-gritty business of exporting and importing goods and the many Irish companies, large and small, that will have to manage that process. It is unfortunate that Covid has overshadowed the Brexit message, although I understand why. Businesses are so shell-shocked by the impact of Covid that some, often the smaller ones, are hoping against hope that things will just work out. In the same way that our message on Covid should not frighten people but inform them, we need to strengthen our approach as regards Brexit and step up our communications and, in certain cases, supports for businesses. Brexit preparedness is paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I have spoken to many business owners, some of whom are as ready for Brexit as possible and some of whom are less so. One business in particular alerted me to the situation in respect of the idea of the exporter and importer of record. Such an exporter has to take responsibility for the actual movement of the goods including the clearance of customs, paperwork, VAT payments, tariff payments and so on. That requires co-operation between sellers and buyers in Ireland and the UK. If somebody is importing from the UK, the same issues apply. Much more work needs to be done in this regard. I ask that whatever extra structures or systems are needed be put in place because the information I am receiving suggests there are gaps here and in the UK, especially with regard to a lack of knowledge on both sides of the supply chain.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> State agencies have played a very positive role but the granular detail of Brexit is the issue. Greater preparedness is needed to help some of these businesses avoid a catastrophe.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, was meant to do the summing up but is unable to as he is waiting for a test result, having been abroad. He is complying with the protocol for officeholders and is waiting for a test result. I am sure it will be fine because I spoke to him this morning and he is in good health.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> I will try to respond to the debate. I thank everybody for contributing seriously to these statements on Brexit. I understand the anger and the frustration, particularly with regard to the UK Internal Market Bill introduced at Westminster, but name-calling in anger will not help us with the challenges we need to overcome in the coming weeks. My focus, as well as that of Michel Barnier, Maroš Šefcovic and the EU task force collectively, is on finding a way to resolve outstanding issues and to get a future relationship agreement in place, if possible, in the weeks we have left available to us in these negotiations. If we allow ourselves to get distracted by other things such as relationships, history or, for that matter, histrionics, we are taking our eye off the real prize. That prize is, as some speakers have referred to, at least a basic trade agreement with the UK that avoids tariffs and quotas and, in doing so, makes the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland less disruptive and a lot easier for everybody to live with. This is what is needed for the tens of thousands of businesses who rely on people like me, the Taoiseach and many others to work through Michel Barnier and his task force and with other EU colleagues and leaders to find a way of getting a deal with the UK. </p>
          <p eId="para_606"> It is a big mistake for those of us in this House to turn a debate on Brexit into one on constitutional change on the island of Ireland. That creates more tension and results in more hackles being raised. If we are to get an agreement that is going to work, we need to take on board the concerns of everybody living on this island, North and South, including unionists and nationalists in order that what has already been agreed can be implemented in a way that works as well as it can for everybody. We must also try to put a new agreement in place with regard to the future relationship, which will remove as many barriers as possible and manage the disruption caused by the inevitable changes Brexit will bring about as best we can. Some of the commentary in this debate would feel almost threatening to a moderate unionist in Northern Ireland. That does not contribute to what we are trying to do, which is to work through a very detailed, complex and technical brief. </p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Of course, there is nothing wrong with an aspiration for reunification on this island at some point in the future. That is as legitimate an aspiration as that of those who want to maintain the <i>status quo</i> as regards the constitutional status on this island. These are, however, debates for a different time. In the weeks ahead, which is all the time we have, we are trying to ensure that what was already been agreed and settled less than 12 months ago in the withdrawal agreement can be implemented in full. The withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland was about trying to deal with the complexity of Brexit in the context of the island of Ireland and trying to ensure the result of Brexit will not be the reimposition of economic division on this island through border checks between North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">We have achieved that. If we were to pursue solutions in the way some people have been suggesting in this debate, we would never have secured the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland in the way we did. It is though diplomacy and building relationships and trust, sometimes with people with whose views we disagree or who come to these negotiations from a different perspective, that we try to build pressure and get outcomes that are good for everyone. The outcome of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland was the best possible outcome available at that time - this time last year - to avert the crisis that would have been created from a no-deal Brexit at the time, should that have happened. It did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Now, we face another challenge in working with our friends and partners across the European Union who are in charge of this negotiation. Let us not pretend otherwise. I hear people saying it is time we put our foot down and we have to fight for Ireland and stand up to the British Prime Minister. This is an EU and UK negotiation. We have done a good job, through professional civil servants across the European Union in every Irish embassy, of creating a strength of solidarity on the Irish vulnerabilities linked to Brexit in a way that has resulted in Michel Barnier and his team ensuring that the solutions agreed thus far with the British Government have accommodated these Irish vulnerabilities in the best possible way for North and South. We are at the point again of trusting and working with the task force and Michel Barnier. We are also trying to work with the relationships we have with members of the British Government to ensure we find accommodation and a way forward to limit the damage. That is what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> As some speakers have said, there is no real upside to Brexit. This is about damage limitation. The way to limit damage between now and the end of the year is to get a future relationship agreement in place and intact. That means a basic free trade agreement. For that to happen and for there to be a foundation stone, there will need to be an agreement and understanding around the level playing field issues to ensure free and fair competition between the two markets of the UK and the EU. Ireland is in the middle of all of that. There will need to be a governance model to ensure that if, in future, either side breaches the agreement or there is a dispute, there is a way of resolving such disputes in a way that is fair, independent and accepted by both sides. Surely that is not an unreasonable request of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> Of course there needs to be what has been agreed in the political declaration, which was agreed in parallel with the withdrawal agreement. There needs to be an agreement on fishing. We have an extraordinarily complex relationship with the UK with regard to fishing. Deputy Michael Collins in particular referred to that today, as have others. The people who live in Greencastle or Killybegs understand the relationship between fishing fleets in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Donegal in terms of how they catch mackerel and where they spawn, breed and grow. They understand how they are then fished to the maximum advantage of everyone, including with regard to the sustainability of the stock. This is something we need to consider in these negotiations. My job is to ensure I protect the interests of the Irish fishing fleet in the context of the overall discussions and negotiations undertaken by Michel Barnier. That is what we are doing. I spoke to Mr. Barnier in some detail this week about our concerns on fishing. These include concerns relating to white fish as well as pelagic species. Those in ports like Castletownbere and Rossaveal as well as the ports along the south and east coasts are concerned. They are waiting for an outcome they hope they can live with in future. Whether it is mackerel, prawns, megrim or hake, whatever the species, we need to ensure we are working towards an outcome that allows our fishing industry to continue in future in the context of access and quota share when it comes to British fishing interests as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> Many useful questions have been asked. If it is okay, I will try to respond in writing to as many of them as I can. Detailed questions were asked on tariffs and the impact on markets. Deputy Fitzpatrick asked a series of questions that have good and reassuring answers. We will come back to him on these.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Deputy Michael Collins asked questions about cross-border healthcare. We will be introducing omnibus legislation linked to Brexit in probably three weeks' time. Health is a major part of that. I am confident that we will be able to deal with the issues the Deputy has raised in that legislation, which he will see when it is published.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> I will sum up by saying there are challenges. Two parallel negotiations are taking place as we speak and there are structures to deal with both. There are two significant outstanding issues in the way of getting a free trade agreement and a future relationship deal done before the end of the year. One relates to the level playing field issue and a governance model that can deal with that fairly for both sides. We have to make progress on that soon. Fishing is also an area where both sides will have to start talking about how we are to find a landing zone to get a deal done. Those are the two big outstanding issues. There are a range of further linked issues but those are the two key issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Deputies have heard me speak about the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Northern Ireland in particular, as well as the linkage to the UK Internal Market Bill. There are effectively three outstanding issues in that regard. I will finish on this because I know I am tight for time. One is the issue of export summary declarations. There is a focus on trying to find a way of resolving that issue in a way that both sides can accept. The other two issues around state aid are linked to the protocol. The issues on Northern Ireland are clear but the extension of that issue into Great Britain is something that needs a resolution. However, if there were agreement around level playing field issues and the state aid element of this in the future relationship, it would effectively solve the problem for the implementation of the protocol. This is because it is a far less complex problem once those state aid issues are addressed in the future relationship. The position is likewise with the goods at risk issue. This applies to the imposition of tariffs on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland potentially finding their way into the EU Single Market. If we can get a free trade agreement that avoids tariffs and quotas, the goods at risk issue, which is contentious at the moment between the two teams, becomes far less of a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> There is a way to get these things done. I encourage both negotiating teams to grasp the opportunity that will present from next week on. There will be a parliamentary break in respect of the passage of the UK Internal Market Bill that has caused so much strife and damaged trust. As it finishes in the House of Commons and before it gets to the House of Lords, there will be a break of several weeks offering a window for negotiation. I hope the two negotiation teams, in particular, the UK side, will use this window to give the signals that are necessary to move this process to a more intensive phase of trying to close out the issues. It is possible to get a deal. We cannot allow ourselves to become pessimistic and defeatist on that. I believe there will be a deal but we need to be firm, respectful and realistic in terms of what is needed to get one across the line. If we do so between now and the end of the year, it will be worthwhile in the context of what would otherwise be the case on 1 January for Irish business and the relationship between Ireland and the UK.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_617">I thank the Minister of State for taking this Topical Issue matter and know that she will relay my concerns to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley. I have a deep concern that in our fight against Covid-19, we have worsened the education inequality curve. Schools play a very important role in children's lives. That social relationship between school teachers and families is very important and disadvantage was highlighted while schools were closed. The Department of Education and Skills made additional provision for special schools and special classes in the context of the reopening of schools, which I welcome, but I am concerned that in the process, pinch points were discovered and nothing was done to fix them.</p>
            <p eId="para_618"> According to the latest census data available, the County Carlow town of Tullow had a population of 4,673, of whom 1,360 were under the age of 17 and 885 were under the age of 19. It is a growing town with growing needs. The reason I mention the census figures is I am going to speak about two schools in Tullow that I have been working with. The first is Scoil Mhuire Lourdes, an all-girls school of approximately 260 students. It has been applying for DEIS status for years but has not been accepted. The other school in Tullow is Scoil Phádraig Naofa, an all-boys school of approximately 250 students. The two schools, which are located beside each another, have been applying for DEIS status for years but have not qualified, even though they really deserve it.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> I went to school at Scoil Mhuire Gan Smál in Carlow town, which is an excellent school of approximately 410 students. What I find difficult to understand is that the girls' school I attended tried to get DEIS status but did not qualify for it, whereas the school beside it, which is a boys' school, did qualify. As a result, there are now families in which the girls attend a school without DEIS status while the boys attend one beside it that does have DEIS status. I cannot understand why. What are the criteria? The two schools are right beside each other, with boys going to one and the same families' girls going to the other. One school has qualified but the other has not. I understand that a review has been ongoing for quite a long time. I will be looking for the review to be finished urgently and for all three schools to be given DEIS status. I return to the issue of Tullow. The reason I mentioned the town and its statistics is there are three schools in Tullow but none of them has DEIS status. I just cannot understand that. </p>
            <p eId="para_620"> I have also been speaking to principals in Carlow and Kilkenny about how fit for purpose the education system is to respond to the needs of children with special needs to access special needs assistants, SNAs. Schools are finding it very difficult. They are buckling under the pressure of one of the largest average class sizes in the OECD. Our towns and villages are changing, a point that has been raised with me several times. The review process needs to be examined so that children will not fall through the cracks in their academic years, especially now when we must be bound by public health guidelines on spacing and learning supports for those who cannot attend a classroom. </p>
            <p eId="para_621"> I am disappointed that my time is so short but I know the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will revert to the Minister, Deputy Foley, and I thank her for her attending the debate. I ask that she comment on the criteria for DEIS status and on why some schools qualify for it and others do not, even though they are located beside each other. Most importantly, she might outline when the review will be complete so that I can respond to the schools that have contacted me.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Josepha Madigan)<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_622">As the Deputy will be aware, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, is the main policy initiative of the Department of Education and Skills to tackle educational disadvantage at school level. The DEIS plan sets out the vision for interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy and is based on the findings of an extensive review of the DEIS programme, which involved consultations with all relevant stakeholders. In 2020, the Department will spend in the region of €125 million on the DEIS programme, providing for smaller class sizes and other supports, including additional teaching posts, home school community liaison co-ordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to continuing professional development and the school excellence fund for DEIS. Furthermore, the Government has allocated more than €375 million under the roadmap for the full return to school, with comprehensive supports for a range of areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> The Deputy mentioned SNAs, a matter which is under my remit, whereas DEIS schools are not. Nevertheless, to satisfy the Deputy's interest, there are approximately 17,000 SNAs in the country at the moment and we have made it a stipulation for the reopening of schools that every absent SNA will be replaced immediately. That is something I made sure would happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> It is also recognised that schools may require some reconfiguration works and this is being supported by a once-off enhanced minor works grant of €75 million to prepare the buildings and classrooms for reopening, including an uplift for schools with children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_625"> The Deputy asked about the DEIS model. A key part of the DEIS plan was the introduction of a new DEIS identification process based on an objective, statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme. As the Deputy may be aware, following the application of this model in 2017, a further 79 schools were included in this programme and 30 schools were upgraded form band 2 to band 1 status.</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> As for the extension of the DEIS programme to more schools - the Deputy mentioned two in Tullow, namely, Scoil Mhuire Lourdes and Scoil Phádraig Naofa, the boys' school - an extensive body of work has been undertaken on the refinement of this model, based on the latest school enrolment data and data available from census 2016 under the Haase-Pratschke, HP, deprivation index. The Deputy also asked about a review. A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS technical group, which includes representatives from the Department and the Educational Research Centre. The Deputy asked when the work would be finished. I understand that the work of this group is at an advanced stage and a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspect of this model commenced earlier this year. It is envisaged that this will ultimately provide the basis for a refined DEIS resource allocation model to match resources to identified need.</p>
            <p eId="para_627"> On the Deputy's query regarding class sizes in DEIS schools, the DEIS programme currently allows for a reduced class size in urban band 1 primary schools, with the application of a preferential staffing schedule to these schools of 20:1 at junior classes and 24:1 at senior classes to support those students at the highest risk of educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_628"> I am confident that the culmination of all of this work on the refined identification model will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and allow us to target additional resources at those schools that are most in need. Until this work is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to further schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">I am disappointed with the reply. Some schools are constantly applying to the Department for DEIS status and have been refused on grounds that do not make sense. When schools that are beside each other, with the girl from one family attending a girls' school that does not have DEIS status while the boy attends a school beside it that does, the whole system is wrong. Whatever the criteria are or whatever the information is that needs to be given, that needs to be changed. It is so important that schools that apply for DEIS status get it. As I said earlier, children's lives are deeply affected by school and DEIS status gives many additional supports to schools, particularly in disadvantaged areas, where it is very important.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">There are three schools in Tullow and not one of them has DEIS status. That should not be allowed to happen in a town such as Tullow. Of the two primary schools in Tullow that have contacted me, neither has DEIS status.</p>
            <p eId="para_631"> I presume the Minister of State is getting a lot of requests about the review in respect of DEIS status because it is being looked at in terms of new criteria and so on. I do not want to be back here in six months or a year's time to hear the Minister of State telling me the same thing again. I do not want to hear the issue is still being looked at because these schools I am representing cannot wait any longer. They need the supports and that includes the teachers, students and families involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">I hear the Deputy's frustration and I understand that. It is important to stress, however, that there is no application process for a school to receive DEIS status. The underlying principle for inclusion in the DEIS programme is evidence of the need to make provision of supports to schools catering for concentrated levels of disadvantaged pupils. The identification process for DEIS status is based on an objective statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme. Variables used in the compilation of the HP deprivation index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rates, overcrowding, social class and occupation and unemployment rates. These data are combined with pupil data supplied by schools that are anonymised and aggregated to a small area, which provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. There are a number of resources available in the DEIS section of the Department's website to assist schools to understand how the process works and to explain how schools can use the data sources to assess their disadvantage levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_633"> The rationale for allocating DEIS resources and supports, based on a school's level of concentrated disadvantage, is based on the existence of a multiplier effect, whereby students attending a school with a high concentration of students from a disadvantaged background have poorer academic outcomes, even taking account of individual social background. Research by the European Research Council, ERC, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, indicates that there is a strong evidence base, in the Irish context, that the social class mix of a school matters, providing a rationale for prioritising supports for those schools that cater for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. I assure the Deputy I will bring the concerns she has raised back to the Department.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_636">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to discuss the issue of dual pricing. It is important that we acknowledge the work of our parliamentary colleague, Deputy Doherty, in respect of this issue. Had it not been for his foresight, I would not be here talking about it today and we would not be dealing with this as an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> We hear terms such as "price walking", "price signalling", "dual pricing" and "differential pricing" but it all amounts to the same thing, namely, how much more money can be squeezed and screwed out of the consumer. It permeates the insurance industry and it is self-evident. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is acknowledging it and the Central Bank is latently acknowledging it.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, and I ask him what the Government's response to this will be, given that there is a programme for Government commitment on it. If the programme for Government is saying we need to ensure there is a level playing field for consumers on the price of car insurance, for instance, what is the solution and what solution is the Government offering? The Labour Party is of a mind to support the Sinn Féin Bill that is before the House because that is a solution to this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> The Central Bank's response to the issue of dual pricing does not leave one inspired and I refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 9 September, which references a senior official in the Central Bank. When this official was questioned about this issue, she advocated for a: "measured and proportional approach, based on actual tangible evidence". We have the tangible evidence. That has been self-evident since 2015 and 2016. The dogs in the street know about this. The official went on to state that the Central Bank was keen to avoid unintended consequences from any new regulations such as the stifling of competition, saying: "If you ban the practice, it might result in some industry firms exiting the market, reducing competition and choice for consumers". My analysis of that response by the Central Bank to this important issue is one that reminds me of how the Central Bank regulated the banks in the worst days prior to the recession. It seems to me to be signalling that there is almost a hands-off, conservative or light-touch approach to this issue and that does not augur well. We want the Central Bank, the Government and this Parliament to finally deal with this issue to ensure there is fairness on how people consume products within the insurance industry. We want to ensure that cartel-like behaviour is done away with once and for all and that Ireland follows the model of the UK on the issue of dual pricing.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> The Minister of State before us has a stout record as an advocate for the consumer. I am hopeful that the Government will take this issue extremely seriously and that the Central Bank will not be conservative in its approach to this issue because everybody is watching it right now to see what way it will move on this issue. We have already had a signal from the CCPC on 17 September on anti-competitive co-operation or in other words, cartel-like behaviour and the consumer is demanding a response. We have crossed a Rubicon and we need an adequate response.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanFleming" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_219">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Sean Fleming)<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_641">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue today. He will know that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I have stated publicly that the insurance industry needs to treat its customers fairly and in line with the Central Bank consumer protection code. The same applies in relation to any practices in pricing that are not fair to its customers. Not only does it have to be fair but it has to be transparent as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> The former Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has asked what the proposal is for dealing with this matter. I hope the Deputy understands me when I say the programme for Government includes a specific commitment to work to remove dual pricing from the market and a proposal will be brought to Government to commence and implement that proposal as soon as practicable. This issue has been hanging out there for quite some time and it was raised by all parties in the run-up to the general election. That is why it is specifically itemised in the programme for Government so it is an issue of concern to everybody here.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> Dual pricing, also known as differential pricing, is the practice of quoting two different prices to different customers for the same product or service, even where those customers have the same risk profile and cost of service. This is also an issue in the UK, where the UK's Financial Conduct Authority has been undertaking a review, which was completed in recent days. However, I stress that just because something is happening in the UK does not mean the same practice is happening here and it would not be appropriate for us to just copy what is being implemented in the UK without detailed examination because each market has its own particular criteria and it is important that they are looked at.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> Late last year, the Central Bank of Ireland announced that it would carry out a study into the practice of dual pricing. I thank the members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach of the previous Dáil, which had the various insurance companies before the committee and they denied the existence of this practice. As a first step, the Central Bank commenced a review and contacted and interviewed various people in the major companies involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">There are fewer than 20 of those companies. They established that the practice is happening and some of the boards of directors in some of these companies were not aware of what was happening in those companies. No information was yielded with regard to the extent of the practice, the number of customers affected and the possible extra income raised by the companies because of the practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> We must establish all of this information and what I would call phase one of the work has been done. It has been established that the practice exists and the chief executive officers of each of those companies have been written to asking for detailed proposals on how to deal with the matter. They have also been asked to bring the issue to their boards of directors, which did not always happen, and to co-operate with further investigation of the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> The Central Bank is moving to phase two of its investigation, which is a quantitative analysis. It will trawl through millions of computer records relating to motor insurance as it is the biggest end of the market in Ireland. There are millions of policies out there so the investigators will be able to check what happened in the past number of years through computer profiling. When the investigators have specific information on the extent of the problem and which companies are operating the different practices, they will issue findings and recommendations at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> I know some people believe we should pass legislation on this because we know there is a problem. I would like to know the extent of the problem, where it occurs and why it happens before moving to commit to legislation. It will take a little time to get more information from the Central Bank but at that point we will be in the position to take definite action.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State but the response does not inspire me, to be honest. If the Central Bank was fulfilling its obligation as the "watchdog", it would already have the evidence. If the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, tell us it has investigated practices as far back as 2015 and 2016, what was the Central Bank doing in that period? There should already be a book of evidence on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> I take the point that the Minister of State is making in respect of legislation but if a legislative proposal is brought before the House, we will look seriously at it and support it. Right now, people looking at this matter are demanding a robust response by the Central Bank, the Government and this Parliament.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> The idea that lower introductory rates can be offered to new consumers of car insurance is not a competitive practice. It is not morally right if there is a penalty applied to a person who is loyal to a particular company. We know that is happening. It would not take a trawl through millions of pieces of data to get the required information as there are enough people in the insurance sector to yield it. There is enough of a body of evidence from consumers and the complaints they have made about this issue and the decisions made against insurance companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> This comes down to the refusal to charge the same price for providing the same service to existing and new customers. It is really a form of pyramid scheme that makes sense only in the context of an exponentially expanding customer base. In other words, it makes absolutely no sense at all.</p>

            <p eId="para_653">I understand completely Deputy Sherlock's statement and his impatience about particular actions being taken at this point. I have explained why we are taking this correct route. I would prefer to gather more information and base any legislative proposals on clear facts that we can stand over rather than jumping the fence too soon and not knowing what is on the other side.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> I understand the Deputy's impatience with the Central Bank and note his remarks that the bank should have been wise to this matter and that it should not have had to work its way up through consumer complaints, Oireachtas committees and complaints heard when canvassing for the general election, which led to it being included in the programme for Government. I understand the Deputy's reasoning for saying the Central Bank should have been ahead of the curve on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> The bank's work will engage not just in examination of computer records of insurance companies but directly with consumers. I do not know how it will do that. It may be a survey or contact with a sample of particular consumers that may feel they have suffered because of dual pricing in order to get direct feedback. It will be an important point. It will take some months to get to the bottom of this and we are only in government a matter of weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> What is dual pricing? For example, I might get an insurance quote of €500 for my comprehensive insurance but a person of the same age, in the same village or town, with the same car of the same horsepower and age, with the same number of penalty points may get charged €600. We must know why that happens. Sometimes the person who gets the €600 quote will write a cheque and send it in the post but another person may ring the insurance company and argue about why the price has increased. When the person indicates he or she will shop around, a lower price may be offered. It is not fair as companies are abusing people who may be seen as a soft touch. It is a practice we must stamp out.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> We are with the Deputy on this and it is in the programme for Government. We want more specific evidence before passing legislation on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">I was contacted by a constituent both of mine and the Minister of State named Natasha and she asked me to read into the record her experience. She states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_659">I want to tell you my story and I hope that the Government will soon reverse the decisions it has made to underestimate the need for women to have some support during their pregnancy. I have two gorgeous little boys. I surprisingly fell pregnant for the fourth time. My partner and I lost our first baby to a miscarriage in 2016.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_660"> I am sure you can imagine the first few weeks after finding out we were expecting again were pretty stressful and filled with anxiety and fear over having a 13-month-old and newborn. But then as the weeks went on that fear turned into hope and love for another beautiful perfect little bundle of joy that would complete our family.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_661"> Eight weeks into the pregnancy I started to bleed. I was called to University Hospital Waterford. I got to the hospital and had to make my way in alone. I waited in the corridor alone. I was seen by a lovely doctor and midwife, who checked me out and found a polyp. When the doctor started scanning me I could see her face change. She explained she was going to see her senior doctor, who would come to check as she had more experience, and left me in the room alone. I cried when I found out that I had lost the baby and I had to experience this on my own. The only person who was there to hug me was a doctor, not my partner.</p>

            <p eId="para_663">We all appreciate that Covid-19 has thrown up some unprecedented challenges for our health service and staff and it most certainly did so for our patients in vulnerable positions and their families. Covid-19 arriving on this island has seen great demands on our people, including behavioural and habitual changes to what we have long been accustomed. That should be recognised by this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> I will focus on the discontinuing of all visitors to our hospitals, including maternity hospitals, and nursing homes or care facilities. In Clare and across the State we have heard heartbreaking stories of loved ones facing difficult information or diagnoses, including diagnoses of cancer, on their own, not having their family with them for support or even as another ear to receive the difficult information.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> People with disabilities are living in nursing homes where they should not be but they cannot receive visitors. Visitation could be facilitated and we could allow these visits on compassionate and critical grounds with proper planning, personal protective equipment and procedures in place. This cannot be a blanket decision and one size will not fit all when we are dealing with people's health and care. </p>

            <p eId="para_666">I will address this matter in the context of maternity services and appointments. Speaking on my own behalf, I am very happy to say my wife is 40 weeks pregnant plus one week and her due date was yesterday. We have lived with these restrictions in place at the Rotunda hospital just like everybody else. We would rather if it was different.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">I am grateful that the pregnancy is progressing well. Deputy Cullinane can speak about the other side of this issue. I am also grateful that this is not our first child. People's first experience of pregnancy, especially of a difficult pregnancy, is very difficult. We have heard that from "Liveline" with Joe Duffy and we read it in our local newspapers. Things are really difficult for people in those situations. I am not speaking on my own behalf but on behalf of people facing additional challenges, risks, anxiety or other strains. Any measure that can be taken on compassionate grounds on a case-by-case basis is very important. </p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_668">I thank Deputies O'Rourke, Wynne and Cullinane for raising this really serious issue. I was under the impression that I was coming to the House to discuss issues concerning visitations to nursing homes, but I will address both issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> This was raised in the Dáil a couple of weeks ago by a Sinn Féin Deputy from Cork. I know it is a very challenging issue. I am a mother of three and I brought either my mother or my husband to every single appointment I ever had when I was pregnant. I want to congratulate Deputy O'Rourke on the baby who will be born very soon. It is a magical time but I know how challenging it is. It is very hard for an expectant mother to face these visits on her own. What Deputy Cullinane read out was devastating. It is absolutely devastating for any woman to be unsure of where to go in a clinic and to get bad news.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> When I stood here to discuss this previously, we were told that the reasons for the policy were purely to do with the prevention and control of infection and the need to limit footfall in hospitals. Very young and premature babies and new mothers are very vulnerable, but obviously partners want to be involved. Though it varies from constituency to constituency and from hospital to hospital, I understand that the majority of hospitals allow partners to be present during the birth, including in the case of a Caesarean section. The main issue is that partners are not allowed to attend a 20-week scan. That scan comes at a very important time during a pregnancy, when parents are able to see how their baby is developing. This restriction is very difficult, as a mother could receive very bad news at this appointment. </p>
            <p eId="para_671"> This was raised with the Taoiseach in the Dáil last week. He said he would discuss the matter with the acting Chief Medical Officer to see if any compassionate grounds would be allowed. I imagine this will be extremely difficult in counties where restrictions are at level 3, such as Dublin and now Donegal. I have raised this with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and I will certainly do so again. This is an extremely difficult situation. A mother is likely to feel emotional, vulnerable, tired and stressed at that time in her life. She is looking forward to the birth of her new baby, but it is very difficult to face that alone. Everybody needs support.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> Deputy Wynne spoke about visitations to other facilities. Unprecedented challenges have arisen throughout our health services, and nowhere more so than in the area of older persons' services. As we all know, nursing homes closed down in early March and family members were unable to visit for almost six months. That was really trying, and I think we have learned that it is not the correct approach. We need to reduce footfall in nursing homes as much as possible and we have to protect our older and vulnerable people, but they are lonely and afraid and want to see their loved ones as well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Violet-Anne Wynne<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_673">I appreciate the Minister of State's presence. The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, needs to look into this matter personally. We need to end the blanket ban on visitors in our hospitals and other care facilities. We need more humanity, more leadership and more solutions. Warm winter gardens could be considered for nursing homes. We are social creatures after all, and we need our families and loved ones when we are at our most vulnerable.</p>

          <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_227">
            <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_674">I thank the Minister of State for her compassionate response and her understanding of this issue. I raised this issue with the acting Chief Medical Officer myself at a meeting earlier this week. I completely understand the infection control measures that are in place in hospitals and the need to maintain social distancing and keep people away from hospitals to protect newborns and pregnant women. We all accept that this is a very challenging time.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> At the same time, we need to consider allowing critical and compassionate access for visitors to residents of nursing homes and the partners of pregnant women. I do not believe that any resident of a nursing home should have to die alone. My own mother died several years ago. I would never allow it to happen if it was my mother, and the same is true for the vast majority of people. When I met the acting Chief Medical Officer he said that two reports were making their way to his desk. One concerned critical and compassionate access for visitors to the residents of nursing homes, and one was on the issue of access to maternity hospitals for partners. Perhaps the Minister of State could find out the status of those reports, the recommendations that have been made and the changes that can be implemented to support Natasha and many others.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryButler" eId="spk_228" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health">
            <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_676">The Covid-19 guidance on visitations to residential care facilities has been developed and is reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis in consultation with key national stakeholders. This is an important document that provides a pathway for safe visiting. Any updates are expected to encompass recent developments in the response. As I stated, however, the existing guidance is not without consideration for visiting on compassionate grounds. That is allowed. It behoves all providers of long-term residential care to balance their responsibility to ensure their residents' autonomy and right to have visitors with the need to ensure that visitations do not compromise overall residential care.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> Visitation was suspended in all nursing homes when Dublin went to level 3. However, a situation arose where window visits were stopped completely. I wish to state on the record that this was not a recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET. The onus is on each nursing homes to set out its own guidelines. I appeal to all nursing homes to allow window visits at a minimum. This does not entail contact between a visitor and his or her loved one, but a visitor can at least see in the window, wave and perhaps have a conversation, especially if a mobile phone can be used.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> I will certainly raise the matter referred to by Deputy Cullinane with the Minister again. I have been contacted by many very distressed pregnant women from all over the country. This situation is very fluid and as we have seen today, it is changing by the day, but I will certainly raise it with the Minister again. </p>

            <p eId="para_679">I note that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Heydon, is here. Since this his first Dáil appearance in this role for which I have been present, I would like to say that it is a great privilege to see a constituency colleague appointed as Minister of State. I wish the Deputy every success in his new brief.</p>

          <speech by="#CarolNolan" eId="spk_230">
            <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_680">I wish to begin by thanking the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this vitally important issue for discussion. I also wish Deputy Heydon well in his new role, which is now more important than ever to rural Ireland and the rural economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> As the Minister of State is aware, the proposal to implement a new TB herd history risk statement and report system has generated a furious response from farmers throughout the State. I am particularly aware of this reaction in Laois-Offaly and among farming organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">The proposal is totally unacceptable. It is my understanding that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took action on this issue before it was agreed by the TB forum. However, the report was meant to have been agreed by the TB forum before any action was to be taken. There is great frustration and anger over that situation. There is significant concern that the new system has the potential to seriously devalue herds, with no protection afforded to farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> In a reply to a parliamentary question I recently tabled on this matter, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, stated that the reports present TB risk information in a user-friendly, detailed and practical form. He also made the point that the development of herd risk categories that are simple, clear and convey sufficient information enables farmers to make the decisions appropriate to their situation. However, there is nothing simple or clear about how this matter has been handled to date. Rather, there is, as I stated, much frustration. It is not acceptable and I hope this system will be taken off the table. It is only right that that be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> If there was consensus that this was an appropriate way to handle the TB issue and the whole situation, it would not have generated the level of outright hostility that has ensued. Mr. Pat Farrell, chairman of the IFA animal health committee, stated that the letters are a ridiculous and weak response to the dramatic deterioration in TB levels in herds. Farmers are being told in these letters that if they bring unsold animals back from the mart, they cannot consider the herd to be a closed herd. However, as the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, has pointed out, we have not seen any scientific research to underpin that stipulation. What is worse is that it will be seen as an assault on the mart trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> It is clear that farmers will continue to bear the disproportionate financial burden for the eradication of TB even though we know that the real area of difficulty in terms of the source of the disease is within the wildlife population, specifically the badger population. I am aware that there are EU provisions such as the habitats directive that protect badgers and other wildlife, but there are derogations to the provisions on species protections which are permitted in circumstances involving the prevention of serious damage to livestock. We need to give these derogations far more serious attention because there is clearly a lack of balance between production of herds and the unwillingness to engage in proportionate levels of badger culling where required. Only this week, I received many reports from my own county of Offaly where there are issues of TB and livestock have been affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> More ongoing assessments should be carried out by the Department in areas where there is an ongoing problem with TB. There should then be a targeted response and follow-up, which could involve the culling of badgers or deer in these areas.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Martin Heydon)<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_687">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue and for the kind sentiments she expressed at the start of her contribution. I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for his kind words. I look forward to carrying out my duties to the best of my ability.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> The issuance of herd test history statements and reports to all cattle herd owners is viewed as just one of several measures that will help herd owners to reduce the risk of bovine TB in their herds. The bovine TB forum interim report identified the need to provide more effective information to farmers to help them to reduce the risk of TB in their herds. It advocated for the development of herd risk categories that can clearly convey sufficient information to enable farmers to make the decisions appropriate to their situation. Against that background, the Department developed individualised reports that provide a simplified TB herd risk category for farmers, with herd-specific advice on how to reduce the risk of TB.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> I reassure the Deputy that I completely understand the frustration among the farm organisations that attended the TB forum. I consulted them and discussed the matter with them. The individualised reports are being seen as though they are the panacea to fix everything. They are one part of a much wider approach that will only work in partnership with farmers and farming organisations, my Department and the other bodies that are involved. That is why I welcome the TB forum being reformed. It will meet next week, on 1 October, and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, will be in attendance. The farmers and my Department can discuss all the key issues we must address. This report is only one part of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> There is a large and robust body of scientific evidence on bovine TB and this underpins the advice contained in the herd history statement. Furthermore, the content of the statement is consistent with the advice that has been provided by my Department for several years in newsletters, videos, leaflets and other media. Farmers have already been provided with information relating to their TB risk, but the new report presents it in a clearer and more detailed way. Following many successful years of reducing bovine TB levels to the benefit of Irish farmers, there has been a concerning incremental increase in the disease since 2016. This has continued in 2020, with further increases in herd incidence and reactor numbers observed. Herd incidence on a 12-month rolling basis has breached 4% for the first time since 2012 and reactor numbers have exceeded 20,000, the highest number since 2011. These trends highlight the need for urgent action by all stakeholders to manage the risk more effectively across all transmission routes. It is this need for action that is my Department's primary motivation in issuing the herd history statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> Although the immediate trends are disappointing and worrying, great progress has been made in the past decade. In 2009, 5,860 herds were subject to restrictions, but in 2019 the number was only 4,060. That is a significant reduction which needs to be recognised. I again make the point that it is only by working together that we have been able to make that progress. We can do so again. That is why the meeting of the TB forum next week will be of such importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> My Department remains committed to reducing TB in Ireland, as demonstrated by the recent sanctioning of an additional 16 officers to assist the TB programme. Attaining TB-free status remains critical from a farm family profitability and sustainability perspective, as well as from a trade perspective at national and international levels. I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant challenge to the farm family concerned. It is a deep regret of mine that more than 2,700 herds are currently restricted, which represents a 20% increase on the same time last year. We wish to work with all stakeholders in ensuring that fewer herd owners experience the challenges associated with TB restriction and that we all work purposefully towards the eradication of this disease, thus eliminating this ongoing cost on farmers and the State.</p>

          <speech by="#CarolNolan" eId="spk_232">
            <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_693">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response, but the fact is that there was a blatant lack of consultation or agreement on this issue and the TB forum was undermined. This heavy-handed proposal needs to be taken off the table. The Department was heavy handed in its approach. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State hopes to engage with all stakeholders and accepts that that needs to happen, but the whole problem is that there was not meaningful and proper engagement with stakeholders. Heavy-handed actions were taken. The decision needs to be reversed and we need to go back to the TB forum and put actions in place that are agreeable to everybody and which will not devalue herds or cause more hardship for farming families throughout the State. The proposal has not instilled confidence in farming organisations or farmers and, as such, it should be taken off the table immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_694"> The costs of the current eradication programme as provided by the Department are slightly more than €90 million per annum. As I understand it, that does not include the significant labour costs associated with the TB programme for farmers which the IFA estimates amounts to a further €20 million annually. Irish farmers contribute a total of €55 million each year to the TB programme, comprising €27 million in annual TB testing costs, more than €7 million in disease levies, and €20 million in labour when facilitating more than 9 million animal tests per year and implementing the disinfection protocols following a disease outbreak. Despite this massive contribution by farmers - it is always farmers who bear the heaviest burden - there is a clear sense that they are being shafted by the new system. That is why I wish to emphasise that it needs to be taken off the table.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> Instead of assisting farmers, it is penalising them and making their lives much more difficult and costly. It also creates significant potential for reputational damage around herd categorisations. I am pleading with the Minister of State to commit to meaningful consultations with farmers and the Rural Independent Group and to stop the roll-out of this system before it does immeasurable harm to farmers at a time when they can least afford it.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinHeydon" eId="spk_233" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine">
            <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_696">I need to clarify that, although the Deputy calls it a system and a proposal, it is neither a system nor a proposal. It is information that has been distilled to farmers previously and that now has been distilled in a clearer way, giving very clear identification as to the risk. It is one key element for farmers in decision making. Farmers make decisions every year on what stock they keep and what stock they cull when bringing in new stock and updating their herd. It is important that farmers have clear access to all of that information when they are doing that.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> Deputy Nolan talks about the financial burden. The Deputy is dead right. The financial burden is significant on farmers because of TB in general. The best way we can ease that burden is to get the trajectory back in the right direction - unfortunately, it has been going in the wrong direction in the past couple of years - and work towards its eradication by 2030, which is a real determination of the Department's, mine, the Minister's and all of the team's, as it is of farmers and farm organisations. I believe that is achievable. It will only be achieved by working together. We see the reducing level of support there has been from the EU for this disease control because our trajectory has been going the wrong direction. If we all work together and get the figures going in the right direction, thus making more progress on this, that will benefit everybody financially to the point where we can eradicate this.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> I also say, wearing my hat as Minster of State with responsibility for new market development, that the fact we have TB status in this country is an impediment to us in accessing new markets and expanding the markets we have. That is bad for farmers as well. It is bad for the overall industry because it restricts us in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> I was a schoolboy back in the day when we had a reactor at home. Thankfully, it was a long time ago, but I remember the devastation of it. It is awful. That is why we have to work with farmers. It is awful for those in that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> This letter and this report were just one part of an approach to that. We will work closely with farmers. We want to eradicate this disease and we will only do that by all working together.</p>

        <heading>Health (Amendment) (Professional Home Care) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:30:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Deputy Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_701">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> In 2011, the Law Reform Commission published a report, entitled "Legal Aspects of Professional Home Care". It set out clear recommendations in this area. To implement these recommendations, it is necessary to introduce legislation to amend the Health Act 2007, which is exactly what this Bill does. The new Bill is necessary and is designed to provide regulation in the area of professional home care. It provides an appropriate regulatory framework and legal standards to be put in place for professional carers, as opposed to informal carers, engaged in the provision of care for people who live in their own home.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The number of people aged over 65 years has increased in the past four years, from 629,000 to 720,000. This is an increase of 90,000. By 2030, there will be 1 million people aged over 65 in this country. Over recent years, the number of people over 80 years of age has increased. In fact, their number in 2016 was 149,000. Based on the figures available to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, it is predicted that by 2036, which is only 16 years away, their number will be 338,000. The majority of older people live active lives. A minority require assistance to live independently, and the increase in the older population is likely to result in a greater need for community-based health and social care services. Government strategy signifies a clear preference to maintain elderly people in their own homes, and yet despite this commitment, there is an absence of a regulatory framework. Home care is not confined to older people. It also involves those who develop a chronic illness, those who have a physical or mental disability or those who are recovering at home after a serious car or work accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> The Bill provides for the extension of the function of HIQA to include the setting of standards in services provided by professional home care providers. It gives power to the Minister for Health to put in place regulations dealing with all aspects of home care, including the requirement to prepare a home care plan. It also allows the Minister to put regulations in place which provide that standards are set for detailed training requirements for those providing these services. The change in legislation provided for in this Bill is necessary if we want to guarantee safe, secure home care for all members of society who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> This is the third time I have introduced this Bill. I introduced it in 2014, in 2016 and now in 2020. This is not a criticism of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, or anyone previously. I fully understand that the Department has a heavy work schedule, but this was first discussed in 2009. Then the Law Reform Commission produced its report in 2011. It is nine years since that report was produced. It is time to move on with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I will quickly go through the sections in the Bill. Section 1 is a standard section setting out necessary definitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> Section 2(1) amends the definition of designated centres in section 2(1) of the Health Act 2007 to include undertakings, both unincorporated and incorporated, and whether established for gain or not established for gain, which are involved in the provision of professional home care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Subsection (2) provides that professional home care should be defined as services which are required to ensure that an adult person can continue to live independently in his or her own home. This may include, but is not limited to, the services of nurses, home care attendants, home helps, various therapies and personal care. It provides that palliative care be included in the definition of professional home care. It also provides that the proposed legislative framework should apply to undertakings which provide professional home care to persons aged 18 years and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Section 3(1) provides that section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Health Act 2007 be amended to extend the functions of the Health Information and Quality Authority to include the setting of standards in services provided by professional home care providers. Subsection (2)(a) and (b) provide the Health Service Executive's national quality guidelines for home care support services should form the basis for national standards for professional home care to be prepared by HIQA under the Health Act 2007. Subsection (2)(c) deals with the issue concerning risk assessments. Subsection (2)(d) deals with the matter concerning the care plan, including the companionship plan, the home care plan and advance home care plan. Subsection (2)(e) provides that the standards include requirements concerning the handling of money and property by the professional care provider on behalf of the care recipient.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Subsection (2)(f) provides that the standards include specific guidance on safety and health requirements in the delivery of professional care in the home, including suitable guidance on manual handling, which shall be developed in liaison with the Health and Safety Authority. Subsection (2)(g) provides that the standards include relevant and detailed training requirements for those providing professional home care services. Subsection (2)(h) seeks to ensure that the standards provide that a contract for the provision of home care must include specific provisions setting out, in plain and easily understood language, the fee arrangements between the contracting parties for the agreed services. Subsection (3) provides the guiding principles to be applied in the legislative framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> Section 4 provides that the social services inspectorate establish a registry of all professional home carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> Section 5 provides that the ministerial regulation making powers conferred on the Minister under section 101 of the Health Act 2007 be extended to and include the authority to make regulations that apply to an undertaking involved in the provision of professional home care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Section 6 includes several subsections. It provides that an assessment of needs of care recipients must be carried out prior to the provision of care and that the assessment considers both the needs of and outcomes desired by the care recipient. Section 6(3) provides for an undertaking providing professional home care services shall make available an easily understood, well publicised and accessible complaints procedure. Section 6(4) provides for an undertaking providing professional home care services shall have policies in place to ensure that professional home care recipients are protected from all forms of abuse. Section 6(5) provides an undertaking providing professional home care services shall agree with the care recipient policies and procedures on the administration of medication in the home, which must be included in the care plan; and maintain a log in the home of all medication administered, which shall be accessible to all. Section 6(6) provides for an undertaking providing professional home care services shall include in the contract for care policies and procedures concerning the handling of money and property by the professional care provider on behalf of the care recipient. Section 6(7) provides that only suitably trained personnel may provide professional home care. Section 6(8) provides an undertaking providing professional home care services shall adequately supervise the individual home care providers to ensure the maintenance of care standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> Section 7 is a standard section setting out the short title and commencement of arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Especially now, when we see the challenges posed by Covid, where more people want to continue to reside in their homes but also require necessary support from home care services, this Bill is necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">I am delighted to have the opportunity to second this ambitious Bill. For too long, there has been an absence of regulations for professional home care. That cannot continue. Great trust is placed on home care workers. They have access to older people's homes and spend large amounts of time unsupervised with them. It is a credit to the professionalism of the home care industry that breeches of trust is not an issue in the sector, but that cannot be left to good fortune. There must be a level of oversight so that people continue to feel safe and be safe in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Deputy Colm Burke has put great effort into ensuring that this issue gets the attention it deserves. The Minister of State is also working on plans in the area and I am certain she will welcome such a well drafted Bill to complement all the work her Department has been doing over so many years. It is a credit to Deputy Colm Burke that he has put a Bill before the House in the first few months of this Dáil while the Department has worked on this issue for years and still has not published legislation. I am sure there are many complex legal issues to justify such a delay but it is their job to overcome these delays not cling to them as excuses for delaying regulations on such an important area. I hope we do not have to wait for a rogue operator in the industry to take advantage of vulnerable people to spur the Department into action, otherwise we will have failed. I look forward to the Minister of State tabling proposals in the next 12 months that largely reflect the good work done by Deputy Colm Burke. I know he will not allow them to kick this important issue to touch, and I will support him in this.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_719">To delete all words after “That” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_720">“Dáil Éireann resolves that the Health (Amendment) (Professional Home Care) Bill 2020 be deemed to be read a second time this day twelve months, in order to allow the Minister for Health to further consider some of the issues with the Bill, and having regard to the fact that the Minister for Health is already in the process of developing a comprehensive regulatory framework to regulate home support services.”</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I am grateful for the opportunity to be here to discuss the important topic of the regulation of home support services. The development of a statutory scheme for the regulation and financing of home support services is a priority for me as Minister of State with responsibility for older people and is in line with successive Governments’ aims to support as many people as possible to live independently for as long as possible in their own homes and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> I would also like to say that I very much appreciate Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins’s intention in bringing forward this Bill and their commitment to introducing legislation to guarantee safe, secure home care for all members of society who need it. I am aware that Deputy Colm Burke has been a strong advocate of regulation in the home care sector for a long time and has previously brought forward a similar Private Members' Bill covering this topic. However, while I very much respect the motivation behind the Bill, some extra time is needed to consider further issues relating to it. For this reason I have tabled the amendment to the motion. The additional time sought from the House today will allow for a considered response to the proposals put forward by Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins. I look forward to working with the Deputies to ensure that a comprehensive regulatory framework grounded in an appropriate legal basis is developed. Indeed, this is what my Department is already planning for. I would like to take this opportunity to inform the House of my intentions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> First let me take a moment to briefly set out how home support services are currently overseen by the HSE. All publicly funded home support is either delivered through the HSE by directly employed staff or commissioned by the HSE by way of a tender and delivered by the voluntary sector or private providers. While there is currently no statutory regulation of home-support services in Ireland, the HSE has put a number of controls in place to quality-assure the services provided and to safeguard service users. As part of this, the HSE has developed national standards to quality-assure all home care services they fund which align with HIQA’s national standards for safer, better healthcare. All HSE-funded home care providers are expected to comply with these standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> The HSE has no remit to oversee the services purchased directly by individuals from providers operating independently in the open market. However, I understand that compliance with national standards is a prerequisite for membership of Home and Community Care Ireland which is the national representative body for for-profit providers of home-support services.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> I agree that building on the safeguards already in place through the HSE, a comprehensive regulatory framework needs to be put in place on a statutory footing to protect recipients of home care and ensure that a standard, high quality, consistent service is in place across the country. However,<b><i>
							</i></b>while fully supporting the aim of the Bill in this regard, I have concerns with the proposed approach. There are characteristics particular to home care which make its regulation different to residential care and I am of the view that a bespoke regulatory framework for home support services is the appropriate approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> The main issue I have is that the Bill proposes to include home care providers within the current HIQA regulatory arrangements by amending the definition of "designated centre" in the Health Act 2007. I do not agree that this is the right approach to take, as home care services are not delivered in any one centre but at different locations and in people's homes. Indeed, I believe that this approach would be unworkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> Instead of extending the register of designated centres, I am strongly of the view that the appropriate approach to adopt to the regulation of home support providers is to develop a bespoke licensing system. HIQA supports this approach. In its March 2017 paper, "Exploring the regulation of health and social care services - Older People's services", HIQA recommended a service provider-based approach and a model of registration based around the service provider with an accompanying suite of regulations tailored for different service types.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> In HIQA's view, following a model of registering or certifying the service provider as opposed to the physical location at which the service is provided offers a number of advantages: it provides clarity to service users, providers and regulators; separate regulations can be tailored to the service model; service providers can be more flexible and innovative, for example, they could accommodate service users with different support needs in the same settings; and administration would be reduced for the service provider and the regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Within this context, my Department is engaged in the development of an appropriate regulatory framework for home support services. The central challenge in the development of this regulatory framework is to ensure quality, transparency and accountability while simultaneously supporting the provision of family and unpaid care and encouraging the development of innovative and technology-based solutions to meeting care and support needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> I will set out for the House at a high level what this proposed approach will encompass. First, it is proposed to draft primary legislation to regulate home support services through the licensing of public and private providers. The objective of such a licensing system is to improve patient safety by ensuring that home support providers do not operate below the standard set by ministerial regulations. The approach being taken in the draft primary legislation will require home support providers to apply to a regulator for licences to undertake home support activities. It would be an offence for a person or provider to carry on a home support activity, either publicly or privately funded, unless he or she was licensed to do so. If a licensed provider is not meeting licensing requirements, the ultimate sanction is the withdrawal of the licence, but other options will be provided to address failings where withdrawal of the licence is not the appropriate action, particularly as a first option of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> Second, in tandem with the development of primary legislation, my Department is progressing work on the development of minimum standards that will form the criteria against which the regulator will determine whether a home support provider's service is of the requisite standard for the provider to be licensed to operate. Pending the enactment of the requisite primary legislation, providers would be encouraged to meet these minimum standards on a voluntary basis. In this regard, my Department plans to undertake a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum standards before the end of the year. I would be more than happy to involve Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins in this process. I will be in touch with home support providers in due course to advise them of my intention and I look forward to engaging with the sector further on the development of appropriate minimum standards, which will serve to safeguard home support users.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Third, the development of primary legislation and minimum standards is expected to be complemented by the development of national standards for home support services by HIQA. My Department has already submitted a proposal for the development of national standards. That proposal is due to be considered by the board of HIQA at its meeting scheduled for next week. I am of the view that the power for HIQA to develop standards for home support services already exists in the Health Act 2007. As such, I do not agree that it needs to be provided for separately as proposed in the Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> If my Department's proposal is accepted, HIQA will follow its established procedure to support the development of new national standards. This will involve a national and international evidence review as well as stakeholder engagement. Therefore, I am of the view that it is not appropriate, as proposed by Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins, to include specific requirements in primary legislation about what should be included in such standards. HIQA already has considerable experience in the development of standards and we should leave it to develop the standards through its tried and tested procedures. If the board of HIQA agrees to undertake the development of national standards for home support services, I expect that there will be ample opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to their development and to ensure that they include appropriate matters, such as those proposed in this Private Members' Bill. If Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins would like to become involved in that process, I would be more than happy to facilitate their engagement with HIQA.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> It is important that all stakeholders be involved in the development of an appropriate regulatory framework for home support services. Along with my officials, I will be more than happy to ensure that the regulatory framework is developed in as collaborative a fashion as possible. We all want the same outcome, namely, a high quality and safe home support service. It is important that we all work together to achieve this outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> I strongly welcome the focus in the winter plan that was published today on providing a substantial increase in the number of home care hours available. I welcome the new Home First approach, which emphasises reablement and providing extensive home support packages to those with more complex needs. This expansion of home care is an integral part of the ongoing development of the much-needed statutory home care scheme, which is a programme for Government commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I am pleased that this Home First approach will bring with it the roll-out of the single assessment tool, which many Deputies will know I have been championing for some time. It is essential that there be consistency in the context of how needs are assessed. Regardless of where someone is in the country or what type of service he or she is entering, be it home care or residential care, it is imperative that his or her postal address not matter. There should be the same assessment of need tool for every person in every country.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> I once again extend my appreciation to Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins for raising this important matter and facilitating this important discussion in the House. Along with my officials, I look forward to engaging further on this critical issue with Deputies, especially Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins, as our work progresses in order to ensure that the most appropriate regulatory framework for home support providers is in place to safeguard all home support users.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">I commend Deputy Colm Burke on introducing this Bill. Speaking as the author of three Bills that were subjected to the dreadful amendment that they would "be deemed to be read a second time this day twelve months", that was not some form of legislative purgatory as most if not all of those Bills withered on the vine. I hope this Bill will not be one of those, but I would not hold my breath. We will see what happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I welcome this timely Bill. Regulation of professional home care is needed, particularly as our population ages and we look to a new model of care for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Covid pandemic has shown us the need for a new statutory national framework and strategy for the care of older people. It is a statement of the obvious that we should seek to care for as many people as possible in their own homes. There are cases where that is not possible and people have to go into residential care facilities, including community nursing homes. Some people will also need a period of hospitalisation. However, there are many people in residential care homes who could be in their own homes if better supports were available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The Minister of State noted in her speech that the winter plan announced today included provision for more home help hours. That provision is quite substantial but it needs to be considered in the context of the substantial cuts that were made in this area over the past five years and more. Those cuts did not make sense when we all agree that we should, as best we can, be treating people in the home. We need to look at the whole area of care for the elderly, including what is happening in nursing homes. I will address that aspect of the matter presently. As a member of the new Oireachtas health committee, which is due to meet for the first time next week, I will do all I can to ensure we deliver a new model of care for older people, and all that needs to flow from that, as part of a broad, in-depth examination of all of these issues by the committee. I look forward to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> We need to look at the structural relationship between the Department of Health, the HSE, nursing homes and care providers, the framework for clinical governance and the need for a deep examination of the current provision and the introduction of better legislation and regulations relating to this sector. Changes in the provision of home care must be brought forward urgently in the spirit of this Bill. The Bill is important for a number of reasons, primarily to ensure quality of care but also in respect of the safeguarding of vulnerable adults. While I support the Bill, I would make the point that we cannot look at this issue in isolation from the need to reform legislation in regard to adult safeguarding. I met representatives of HIQA some weeks ago to discuss this issue. We all know what happened in nursing homes as a consequence of the Covid crisis. However, it is true that over time, the vast majority of people get the very best of care in nursing homes. Having said that, there are instances where abuse and neglect occur. Those issues need to be dealt with and there must be investigations and examinations into all such instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> In private nursing homes, social care teams do not have the power to go in of their own volition; they must be invited to do so. It is a cause for concern that adult safeguarding legislation is quite weak and it needs to be amended. HIQA sets the standards in this area, as it does in other areas and it is very eager to play a role in this regard. Indeed, it has said that there is a need for change in this area. Adult safeguarding concerns also apply in the case of home care, where caregivers are going into people's homes to look after them. We must protect the recipients of that care by ensuring there are proper regulations and enforcement in place. Standards of care are one part of the issue and what this Bill seeks to address. Work in that area is needed but it must be done in tandem with work on adult safeguarding standards, which also requires robust enforcement of legislation. There is an absence of legislation in both areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I commend Deputy Colm Burke on the Bill. As I said, I look forward to working with the Minister of State and the Minister, at the health committee, in looking at all of these areas. I genuinely hope we can all work in a spirit of co-operation with a view to ensuring we get the very best national strategy for the care of older people, including in their own homes but also in residential care settings and elsewhere. We need a strategy that is robust and effective and underpinned by strong regulation and enforcement. Where there are breaches, as we have seen in the past, the powers of enforcement must be sufficient to deal with them. Our objective should be to have the very highest standards of care for older people set out in legislation and in a national statutory framework.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulineTully" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_751">I welcome the Bill brought forward by Deputy Colm Burke and the regulation it proposes to introduce for this sector. I would fully support any policy or legislation which seeks to put in place the necessary supports to allow older people or people with disabilities to remain living in their own homes. Demand for care services is due to rise in the coming years as the population of older people grows. A capacity review that was carried out by the Department of Health estimated that a 120% increase in home care provision would be needed between 2017 and 2031. That growing demand is not being met at the moment, with some 6,000 people on HSE waiting lists. As we know, not everybody is in a position to pay for home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> The Bill sets out provisions in section 6, which inserts the new section 106(1)(b) into the Health Act 2007 regarding assessment of needs. I note that the needs listed under this subsection differ greatly from the needs considered when a person is applying for the carer's allowance, for example. I agree that the needs listed in this Bill should indeed be taken into account when somebody is looking for home care hours in order to stay at home. My concern is that in the case of carer's allowance, unfortunately, only those at the highest level of need are considered and it is quite difficult to secure a successful outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> There is also a reference in the Bill to "suitably trained personnel". Home care assistants working for the HSE are required to have a FETAC level 5 qualification as a minimum. In the private sector, some of these workers are paid less than €10 per hour, which is less than the minimum wage. Many have to travel up to 40 minutes for what might be a half-hour slot and they are not paid for the time they spend travelling. In the current circumstances, they are not reimbursed for the personal protective equipment, PPE, they are required to use. As a result of the poor pay and conditions for these workers, staff turnover is high, which is detrimental to both carers and home care recipients. On the other hand, there are some people without qualifications who are calling themselves home care assistants. This happens because there is no legal requirement for assistants and carers outside the public sector to have full formal training. That leads to gaps in knowledge and practice. I have also heard of carers being thrown in at the deep end without proper training, which is not fair to them or the care recipient. There is very little continuing or in-service education and a lack of governance within the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Another concern is that there is no register of home care assistants, which means the title, as SIPTU has highlighted, is not protected. As I said, anybody can call himself or herself a home care assistant. This means that if a carer is guilty of abusing a care recipient, there is nothing to stop him or her getting a caring job elsewhere because there is no register from which he or she can be struck. Many of the private companies are driven by profit and I suggest that strong consideration be given to supporting not-for-profit providers. The lack of regulation means the professional home care companies are not held to account by anybody. People in receipt of home care services are vulnerable and need to be supported and protected. We are behind many of our European counterparts in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> While I welcome better regulation as a means of protecting home care recipients and improving pay and conditions for employees, that regulation should not be overburdensome, which might have the effect of pushing small providers out of the market. The top three home care companies, which between them received €110 million from the HSE last year, are all large, non-Irish companies. I am concerned that the potentially high cost involved in regulation could drive out the smaller companies and thereby reduce competition.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patricia Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-09-24T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_756">I welcome the Bill introduced by Deputy Colm Burke. It is unfortunate that it is coming nine years after legislative provision in this area was recommended by the Law Reform Commission. Strong regulation in respect of professional home care services is long overdue. The number of people aged over 65 in this country is expected to increase to more than 1 million by 2040. Moreover, the number of people aged over 80 is set to increase dramatically. As Sinn Féin spokesperson for older people, I am aware that the majority of older people live active lives. Indeed, many of them are the backbone of our charities through the voluntary work they do. I had the pleasure of working with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in both Athy and Kilcullen in south Kildare, where many of my fellow workers were older volunteers. Those men and women were very good at their job and I commend them on the work they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> A minority of older people require assistance to live independently and the increase in the older population will likely result in a greater need for community-based healthcare and social care services. If possible, this should be provided in people's own homes, as the Minister of State acknowledges. The need for home care is not confined to older people. It is also required by those who develop a chronic illness, those with a different physical or mental ability and those who are recovering at home after illness or an accident. I welcome the extension of the function of HIQA to include the setting of standards in regard to services provided by professional home care companies. I hope the Minister of State will, on the back of this Bill, introduce regulations dealing with all aspects of home care, including the requirement to prepare a home care plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">We also need to set standards around detailed training requirements for those who provide these services. I particularly welcome the requirement to include the contract for care policies and procedures for the handling of money and property by the professional care provider on behalf of the care recipient. We have all heard horror stories of elder financial abuse. The Bill contains an undertaking to provide professional home care services. It must have policies in place to ensure the professional home care recipients are protected from all forms of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> Our older citizens have been disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Telling them to cocoon and to stay out of sight until they are told to rejoin society is really not acceptable. We now need to see respite and care services reopened and we need to see a balance between physical health and mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> I commend the work of nurses, palliative care and home care attendants, home helps, various therapists and the personal care assistants who provide the home care. The work done by Older Voices Kildare and Ms Denise Croke and her team of volunteers is invaluable. I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to Kildare, and Deputy Colm Burke at his convenience, to meet groups such as Older Voices Kildare. Hopefully we could then loosen up the Department's purse strings and maybe get something in their favour. I thank Deputy Colm Burke again for introducing the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">After the most recent election, an exit poll conducted by <i>The Irish Times</i> highlighted that 40% of voters said health was the most important issue influencing their vote. The subsequent pandemic has further highlighted the need for systematic change within our health service. Therefore, I welcome the introduction of the Bill this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> The programme for Government includes a commitment to "Expand community-based care bringing it closer to home, in line with the Sláintecare Implementation plan" and "Introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes which will provide equitable access to high quality, regulated home care." Covid-19 and its devastating impacts and consequences for residents in nursing homes must make this even more of a priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her colleagues in government. I would also like to think that when the Minister of State and her colleagues say "statutory", they mean statutory and not the channelling of more public funds into agencies and commercial providers in the private sector as the first port of call over the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> There can be no doubt that there needs to be a radical shift in how we care for our elderly, our more vulnerable and those who provide that care. The policies of successive Governments over recent decades have resulted in an expansion of home care in the private sector, coupled with a devaluing of public and not-for-profit providers. The main issue that has contributed to this growth of private sector providers is the lack of capacity in the public sector. Instead of the State investing in the public provision of care to address capacity, funds have been channelled towards private providers. As my colleague, Deputy Tully, has outlined, this has been to the tune of more than €100 million. The implementation of competitive tendering in 2012, which was a startling development whereby private companies compete with one another to win contracts to provide care, was based on criteria that included price. This cultivated the conditions necessary for the growth and profits of the private sector of home care provision. This has had repercussions for the home care workers and for the quality of care provided. I hope it is obvious to the Minister of State, as it always has been to me and my Sinn Féin colleagues, that when the provision of care is based on a business of profit, care can also be sacrificed to that profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> Another unsettling fact that has become more widely known is that there is a vast disparity of working conditions among carers in the public and private sectors. Those employed directly by the HSE have guaranteed hours of work, sick pay and pensions. On the other hand, those employed by private care are often on low pay and have precarious if-and-when contracts. The Home Care Coalition estimates that while there has been a 20% reduction in the provision of home care demands since the arrival of Covid-19, the end result has been the reduction of hours and income for home carers in the private sector. Crucially, these workers have not been laid off and are not entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> A further discrepancy that needs to be tackled is the issue of unpaid travel time. HSE-funded packages are often subcontracted out to private providers, yet they do not include pay for travel time. HSE staff are entitled to travel allowance. If a private home care provider has to travel between six or seven clients per day, over the course of the week this leads to hours of unpaid work.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> When I recently met representatives of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and business representatives in Longford-Westmeath about their pre-budget priorities, both sectors raised the fair deal scheme as an issue. A key concern of the IFA is the urgent need to reintroduce the nursing homes support scheme (amendment) Bill 2019. This is a key ask because since the introduction of the scheme, it has been a potentially uncapped liability for farm businesses and for small family-owned businesses. These are productive assets required to generate income. They are not a measure of additional capacity to pay. The current fair deal scheme has seen anxiety and significant uncertainty for family farmers and for small family-owned businesses. There is a genuine fear that the viability of farms and businesses will be undermined while families attempt to meet the cost of care. I put it to the Minister of State that this is very unfair. Traditionally, farms and small businesses in my constituency have been passed down through generations. One barrier to the next generation taking over the farm can be the death of a person associated with it, whereby the fair deal scheme includes assets transferred within the last five years. One vital factor for constituencies like mine with very rural communities is the importance of these farms and businesses because they continue to operate when other employers do not. They play a vital role in supporting rural employment and the social fabric of many small rural towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> When the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, spoke at length on licensing, a question jumped to my mind. I am sure it occurred to others in the Chamber tonight. Will this equate to another financial burden intended to be borne by already low-paid workers in the private home care sector?</p>

          <p eId="para_768">I commend Deputy Colm Burke on the Bill. I welcome the opportunity to speak, as it will allow me to talk about the care of our older people. In this regard we are really talking about ourselves because, if we are lucky, old age will come to us all. I am sure that most of us here would like to live independently at home for as long as possible and then, if necessary, with some form of independent but sheltered arrangement in the community. The word "independent" matters. It is one of the great injustices of old age that, just as we gain the wisdom of years, we can so easily lose our say, our choices and our autonomy, going from managing homes, families and businesses to "Does she take sugar in her tea?". This is why for older people, independence, home care and home supports must be high on the agenda of a modern republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> I specifically want to address the deaths of men and women in nursing homes. For some, the nursing home was their home. We paid a heavy price in my constituency of Kildare North. In April of this year, there was sixfold increase in deaths in nursing homes in Kildare. Sixfold is critical. It is huge. Husbands, wives, grandparents, aunties and uncles died unnecessarily. Some of them may only have had five or six years left, but five or six years is a long time in the life of a grandparent or a grandchild. Five years can see a newly born grandchild, a grandchild having a first day at school, or a young adult granddaughter getting married and starting a family of her own. As a result of Covid-19, these years and experiences were stolen. In north Kildare, their stealing haunts us and it is right that it should. Last month Professor Denis Cusack, the county coroner for Kildare, published his report into nursing home deaths in Kildare. Professor Cusack's interviews on "Drivetime" and KFM stopped me in my tracks. His concern, shock and compassion were palpable. Suddenly there was an official warmth and openness to replace the certain coldness and closedness that seemed to have taken hold.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">There was a sense that we should not be looking because mistakes were made and blame might follow but nobody wanted blame then and nobody wants it now. I said that to Deputy Harris when he was the Minister for Health. What we want is to learn because if we do not learn, we risk a repeat and we simply cannot allow that to happen in the coming winter. </p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Out of 139 cited Covid-19 deaths in Kildare over this period, 113 were in nursing homes. In a reply to a parliamentary question the HSE told me that neither the executive nor the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, collected testing data prior to the transfer of patients from hospital to nursing homes. There were over 60 such transfers in north Kildare and when I highlighted this, there was not much interest. It is a hard fact of politics now that for some Mean Girls has more resonance than dead girls, especially when those dead girls are old. However, the coroner in confirming their deaths, brought these people's voices back to life. He spoke of the atypical presentation of Covid, the lethargy, the loss of appetite that was not recognised, the quietness and the tests that were left undone. In this, Professor Cusack has done the dead in Kildare and the State some service and I thank him for that. He says that we need to know why Kildare was so disproportionately affected and he is right. I thought at the time that perhaps there were more nursing homes in Kildare than in other counties but that simply was not the case. Kildare suffered very badly. We cannot and must not wash our hands of this because for the dead, the unique and the loved, we must hold firm. </p>

          <p eId="para_773">I wish to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this important debate in the House. Once again I would like to thank Deputies Burke and Higgins for bringing forward this Private Members' Bill. The debate this evening has been very useful and the early discussion of the issues concerned will be of great benefit as my Department continues to progress proposals to regulate the home support sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I thank all of the Deputies for their contributions in what is known as the graveyard shift, late on a Thursday evening. It is great to see so many Deputies present and I thank them for being here to discuss the Bill proposed by Deputies Colm Burke and Higgins. I welcome the fact that Deputy Patricia Ryan is the spokesperson for older people for Sinn Féin. I have already met Deputy Ward, who is the Sinn Féin spokesperson on mental health, and would be happy to meet Deputy Patricia Ryan some day to discuss the various issues about which she is concerned. She was quite right when she said that home care is not confined to older people. Far from it. We have many children with intellectual disabilities, adults with disabilities and many others who need home care and it is so important that we get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> I accept Deputy Clarke's point that statutory should mean statutory. She spoke at length about a fair deal for farmers, which is something I have been working on since taking up my role about ten weeks ago. The situation last year was that legislation was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny. Then we had the Christmas break, followed by the election. The committee has been reconvened and I have written to the clerk to find out the status of the legislation because I would like to move it before Christmas if possible. It will have an enormous effect on farmers and small business owners. As we all know, under the fair deal scheme, there is a charge on an individual's property of 7.5% for three years but there is no cap for farmers or small business owners. I am very conscious of that fact and fully aware of it. I met representatives of Macra na Feirme last week who raised it with me. I will also be meeting representatives of the IFA this week. I assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the issue and thank her for highlighting it again tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Having heard Deputy Cronin's contribution, I will listen to a podcast of Professor Cusack's interview. The Deputy is quite right to say that the pandemic has borne down hardest on our older population. It certainly bore down very hard on elderly people living in nursing homes. Approximately 54% of all deaths to date occurred in the nursing home sector and I am acutely aware of that. The HSE and the Department of Health are working very hard with the nursing home sector to make sure that what occurred earlier this year does not happen again. We are working to ensure that they have the necessary PPE, the staff they need and that adequate infection prevention and control measures are in place. As the Deputy knows, the expert panel's review of nursing homes was published recently. Three meetings have been held already to meet the sector's short-term requirements in advance of the winter because we could be facing into a winter of the vomiting bug, influenza and Covid-19. I assure Deputies that I am on top of all of that and I am happy to work with them on these issues. It is great to hear so many Deputies interested in our older people. It was clear from everyone's contributions that they care and it is great to see that. </p>
          <p eId="para_777"> There seems to be consensus across the House on this issue. We may have different views on how this can best be achieved but we ultimately all want the same result, that is, a comprehensive regulatory framework placed on a statutory footing to protect recipients of home care and ensure that a standard, high quality, consistent service is in place across the country. A high quality, consistent home support service focused on keeping people well in their homes and communities for as long as possible is a key enabler to ensuring that people across a continuum of care get the right care in the right place at the right time. A comprehensive regulatory framework is a crucial component of this. </p>
          <p eId="para_778"> As the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I was delighted to be part of the launch this morning of the HSE's winter plan. It is very important to me that this plan has a strong focus on supporting older people. Our aim must be to provide as much care as possible in the community but where people do require hospital care, we must enable them to be discharged back to their own home, with support in the community, as soon as possible. The last thing we want to see is older people in acute beds in hospitals during the winter when the only place they want to be is at home. I was delighted to see the focus in the plan on providing a very substantial increase in the number of home care hours available. We know that Irish people are living longer than ever before which is very welcome news but we need to ensure they live well. In that context, we need to do more. I sat on the other side of the House for the last four years and on every opportunity I got, I raised the issue of home care supports, wraparound supports, home care packages and so on. At one stage there were between 6,000 and 7,000 people waiting for supports. Hopefully the 5 million additional home care hours announced today will enable us to really tackle those waiting lists. </p>
          <p eId="para_779"> I appreciate that Deputy Burke must be somewhat frustrated at the perceived lack of progress but I assure the House that my Department is committed to advancing this work as a priority. While there is no doubt that the Private Members' Bill we are discussing in the House this evening is very well-intentioned, for the reasons I have already set out, I do not believe the approach proposed is the appropriate way to progress this issue. As I have already outlined to the House, my Department is progressing a bespoke regulatory framework for home support services along three strands. The amendment I have tabled this evening will provide the time for my Department to consider the issues raised during the debate this evening and determine how best to address these issues in the context of the development of the appropriate regulatory framework. As I said earlier, I look forward to working with Deputies Burke and Higgins and any other interested Deputies to progress this work as a matter of urgency over the next 12 months. </p>

          <p eId="para_781">I thank the Minister of State for being here this evening to deal with this matter. I fully appreciate that there are lots of pressures on the Department of Health as it is an area on which I have focused since coming into the Oireachtas back in 2011. I also thank all of the Deputies who contributed to this debate. I very much appreciate that and I also thank my colleague, Deputy Higgins, for her support in working with me on the drafting of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> I wish to advise the Minister of State that I do not go away. This is the third Bill that I have instigated. I initiated a medical practitioner's (amendment) Bill relating to professional indemnity insurance for all doctors. When I came into the Oireachtas, that was not the law so I introduced a Private Members' Bill. That is now law, as a result of a Government subsequently bringing forward a Bill. The second one was missing persons legislation, the Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Bill which I was told could not be done. In fairness, I got the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, on board and that is now law.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I hope I will also be able to contribute to the implementation of legislation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> My involvement with elderly care goes back to well before I came into this House in that I was involved in a legal challenge to the Department of Health in regard to the provision of nursing home care, which subsequently, as a result of that legal challenge, changed the whole process of how we provide nursing home care. Even though we sometimes think that when we are outside this House, we cannot bring about change, in fact, when we can use the courts system, we can force the change that is required and force proper structures to be set in place. I am delighted that, as a result of those legal challenges, proper structures were put in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_785"> I believe it is time to deal with this issue. As I said earlier, this is my third time bringing forward a Bill. While I fully accept there are other pressures on the Department, I believe that as a result of Covid, more than anything else, there is now an urgent need to deal with this whole area. The figures I produced earlier demonstrate there will be 338,000 people aged over 80 by 2036, which is only 16 years away, and 1 million people aged over 65 by 2030. Therefore, we need an increased level of home care available because an increasing number will be looking for that kind of support. </p>
          <p eId="para_786"> A lot of research has been done already. The Health Research Board did work in 2017 which looked at programmes in Scotland, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Quite a lot of research has been done in regard to what is in place in other countries, and we should use that without having to go down the road of doing further research, given the information is already set out quite clearly. Likewise, the Law Reform Commission report in 2011 was based on a huge amount of research which was set out quite clearly on the publication of that report. The groundwork is done. I have no problem working with the Minister of State to amend anything needed to deal with this area, but I believe it is important that we have the regulation in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> We do not give enough recognition to informal carers, although I know we do not need legislation for them. The last CSO figures showed there were 195,000 people providing informal care in their own home. We need to acknowledge the work they are doing and how they are caring for someone in their home. They are doing this not for two or three hours per day, not for two or three days a week, not for two or three weeks a year, but 24-7, 365 days of the year. We need to acknowledge their contribution and the work they are doing. </p>
          <p eId="para_788"> It is also important that we acknowledge the work provided by carers employed either by the HSE or the private companies. While we might be critical of some of the private companies, they are providing a service where the statutory agencies are not able to provide it. In drafting legislation, we need to make sure we cover all the angles, whether the service is provided by the HSE or other State agencies, or by private companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> I am determined that we will have legislation in this area before this Dáil is dissolved. This is crucial for the people who want care but we must also make sure that the appropriate level of care is provided. Coming from a legal background, one of the things that concerns me, and one of my colleagues referred to this during the debate, is the abuse of elderly people. I have seen it. We need to make sure we have all of the processes and procedures in place so this can be easily brought under control without someone suffering any loss. It is extremely important that we provide that. There were a number of reports recently in the newspapers, and the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday</i> recently had a very disturbing story in regard to a person with a disability who was provided with care but that care fell totally short of what the person wanted, and it was clear there was also abuse. It is important, where members of the general public are concerned in any way about the care being provided, that they bring that information to the relevant authorities and make them aware of it. We all have a part to play. There is no point saying, “That is someone else's problem, not mine.” It is our problem. It is important that we make sure our elderly are protected at all stages in regard to financial matters and in regard to their care, upkeep and healthcare. </p>
          <p eId="para_790"> We need to move forward with this legislation. I fully accept the Minister of State requires time and I look forward to working with her. I want to make a contribution to this in the same way I have made a contribution to the other legislation I have been involved in. I hope that, by this time next year, we will have a clear programme in place for the legislation to go through and be enacted, and to have it fully operational. </p>
