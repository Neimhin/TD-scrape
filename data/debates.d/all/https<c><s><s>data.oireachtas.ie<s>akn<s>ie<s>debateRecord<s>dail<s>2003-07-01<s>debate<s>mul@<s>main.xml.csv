#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, the cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs usually meets every month. At the May meeting, the team's deliberations were focused on the national strategy on broadband telecommunications. The most recent meeting of the team took place on 11 June. The principal items considered were waste management and preparations for the visit by Professor Maynar.The purpose of Professor Maynar's visit was to advise the Government on the Madrid metro extension project by reference to the ongoing deliberations on a possible metro system for Dublin. The next meeting of the cross-departmental team is scheduled for 9 July, with the main agenda items being energy policy and the mid-term review of the national development plan.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Arising from that, I ask the Taoiseach, first, who the Government blames for the gross overestimation of the cost of the metro project. Is the Taoiseach now confident that, following the visit of the Spanish engineer and professor, €2 billion has been cut off the estimated cost? Is he happy with his cross-departmental team and that this kind of grossly inflated cost factor is not built into all the major construction projects that are required around the country?Second, the Institute of Industrial Engineers recently commented very unfavourably on the national development plan, suggesting that it was years behind time and would not be completed until 2013. Does the Taoiseach feel that it is now time to have a real review of the national development plan to see what priorities can and will be delivered on budget and on time, rather than having a list of aspirations that will clearly not be met within the planned timetable?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	2	As Deputy Kenny knows, no decision has yet been taken by the Government on the metro. The position is that on foot of a Government decision, the Railway Procurement Agency undertook an assessment of the various options around the metro system in Dublin. Following a visit by the Minister for Transport to Madrid in February or March, and a follow-up visit by senior officials, the RPA has just completed a revised proposal which it has put to Government for consideration.Drawing on the Madrid metro experience, the revised proposal involves a significant decrease in the original estimate that was put. The original estimate was a fairly rough assessment by the RPA, but there was an enormous difference between that and the revised estimate. In light of the revised RPA proposal and the insight provided by Professor Maynar in the course of his visit to Dublin, further consideration will be given to the proposal for a metro system linking the airport to the city centre. As of now, the metro project for Dublin has neither been ruled in nor out.In relation to the national development plan, a review is scheduled this year in any case. That was built into the project covering the period 2000-06. As I previously said, the report of the Institute of Industrial Engineers has many very positive things to say about infrastructure, but it states that there has been a falling behind on some of the projects. As I previously stated, quite an amount of the resources in terms of the design by engineers and others in the construction team led to high price inflation, which eat into the original cost indicated. That has been the main, although not the only, cause for the delays.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I know that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is trying to do the best he can in difficult circumstances and everybody wants these matters sorted. Is it not a fact that in 1997 the Government inherited a Luas project which was ready to roll and its cost had been estimated? The project is now four years behind time, its budget has trebled, the company selected to run it has lost its rail contract in the UK and the timescales set for it will not be met.I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions on this matter. Is it a fact that the lines from Sandyford and Tallaght will not be available until autumn 2004 at the earliest? Is it the case that the two lines being built are not to the same gauge and that even if they were to be joined eventually, the trams from one line could not be used on the other line? If it is the case that we will have two tram lines unconnected and that if they were connected the trams from one line could not run on the other, that would be a ludicrous form of engineering. I am not sure who is responsible for this, if that is true. Can the Taoiseach confirm if that ridiculous notion is true?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Taoiseach said that the last matter discussed was the metro.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I appreciate that—
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	7	My question is not a very detailed one and the Taoiseach knows about this.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	8	—but the Chair has ruled continuously that detailed questions should be directed to the appropriate Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	9	My two questions are whether the lines will not be available until autumn 2004 and whether they are built to the same gauge?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Sandyford line will be ready this time next year. Work on the other line is a little behind but I understand it will be ready in August. The two lines should be available next summer to early autumn. On the issue of the gauge, the two lines are of the same gauge. The suggestion that trains from the two lines will not be interchangeable is totally incorrect. The trams on the Sandyford line will be 40 metres in length; the St. Stephen's Green line will have 14 trams in total and the trams will be 30 metres in length; and there will be 26 trams on the Tallaght-Connolly line. The difference in length of the trams is related to projected passenger numbers on each route, but the lines are of the same gauge.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Does the Taoiseach agree that the experience of public private partnerships, particularly in the transport area, has not been good to date? As Deputy Kenny indicated the estimated cost of the Luas has escalated in six years from €288 million to nearly €800 million, which is made up of €691 million plus a risk provision of €90 million. Does the Taoiseach agree that the experience of the mini-CTC signalling system and now of dealing with a company which has been found to be incompetent in England in terms of management of rail services does not bode well for continuing reliance on public private partnerships in the public transport area? Will he learn any lessons from the experience in the UK where British Rail in 1989-90 got a subsidy of £885 million in real terms whereas in 2003-04 the subsidy to private rail operators is in the order of £3.8 billion?Given the concerns people have about following that particular model, will he indicate what type of contract the Government has with Connex, which is currently the subject of considerable media reporting? Does the Government have an opt-out clause if Connex does not perform satisfactorily? Would he see merit in having some type of public sector price comparator in relation to public transport projects in general to compare whether perhaps there is more merit in using the pension reserve fund to publicly fund some of these major infrastructural projects rather than look to a company which, from its UK experience, is not up to scratch?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The original €288 million pertained to the old design that changed totally over the period in question and which was subject to the public inquiry into the length of the Sandyford line and other matters. It is not a relevant cost. The relevant cost now is €80 million to €90 million. That is more than the contract price, but it was in the contingency figure. I do not believe there is any great difficulty in this respect.Public private partnerships can be structured in different ways. We have had some successful ones – it is a question of structure. We have had successes in respect of some of the roads, schools and waste water projects. It has been on different contracts—
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Only some.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	14	As I stated previously to Deputy Sargent and the House, the return required on some projects is high and not of great value. The Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency would argue that it is always easier for the State to borrow. This always has to be considered. However, as we saw in respect of the Madrid metro and other projects throughout Europe, ways were found to arrange such issues outside of the growth and stability pact. Countries that adopt this approach do so on the basis of public private partnerships. They could not do so if it was not on this basis.The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has made very clear his support for increased investment of the pension reserve fund in various projects. This can only be done if it makes absolute commercial sense because the fund managers have to look after the people's pensions in the longer term. Discussions on this matter are ongoing and I hope they will lead to investment in some of the major infrastructural projects. The Government desires this and it is the brief of the Minister for Transport to try to achieve it.After a competitive process in compliance with EU tendering rules, the contract for the operation of the Luas system was awarded to Connex by the RPA. Connex is part of a large international conglomerate within the Veolia group and it operates heavy and light rail systems and bus services in more than 100 locations throughout the world, including France, Germany, Sweden, the US and Australia. The UK operation has been subject to controversy, as Deputy Sargent stated, because the Strategic Rail Authority has withdrawn Connex's licence for heavy rail operations.The contract between the RPA and Connex is performance related, with specifications set in respect of quantity, quality, output and performance. There are tight restrictions, penalties and bonuses, as well as opt-out clauses. Connex will collect fares on the RPA's behalf and these will be set against an agreed fee. Should revenues fall short of the contract sum, the balance will be paid by the RPA, conditional on Connex's performance. The contract includes penalty clauses for failure to meet targets, and bonuses for exceeding them. It was signed in May 2002 and it will be binding for five years from the commencement of the operations.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	15	There is an opt-out.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Yes.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Has the Taoiseach read the review of the Institution of Engineers of Ireland? If so, does he agree that its analysis of the implementation of the national development plan makes for dismal, disturbing reading in that it shows up an incompetence at Government level which is creating problems in terms of time and budget in the delivery of projects? Is he aware that the lack of confidence is now so great that even a Minister of State in his own Department has expressed a loss of faith in projects such as the N11 at Kilmacanogue? Deputy Roche, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, is demanding an inquiry into the management of the delivery of the national development plan in this area.Where is the political leadership behind the national development plan and who in the political arena is responsible for it? Who is responsible for driving it and ensuring that targets are reached? Who is the project manager for the project? Who is the civil servant dedicated on a full-time basis to ensuring that the delivery of this plan is on target and within budget? There is a failure at this point with regard to the Government's competence to ensure that the plan is delivered on. The Institute of Engineers of Ireland has clearly shown that these deficiencies are serious and are not being addressed in any coherent way.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Members of the Institute of Engineers of Ireland are upset with Members of the Opposition who have been citing parts of their report selectively. The report is complimentary about infrastructural work taking place in this country. Over the period 2000-02, 26 roads projects have been completed, involving 150 km. of road. Some 13 projects have opened up this year, and we have had many major projects which I have noted on the record of the House many times.The engineers involved were embarrassed at the increase of almost 50% in construction price inflation, not to mind fees, from the start of the NDP to the end of the third year. The roads evaluation, in which the engineers have great interest, shows that there was a 38% increase in tender prices over a very short period of time.As for the management of the contract, the Department of Finance has a co-ordinating role, but each individual Minister has responsibility for the projects that fall within his or her brief. The cross-departmental team involves officials from a number of Departments who work day-to-day on the projects. We are spending about 5% of GNP on capital programmes, which is about 1.5% higher than in any other European country. Recently, along with Deputy Quinn, I viewed a €300 million project, the occasion being the opening of the final stretch of road on the northern motorway – apart from the Dundalk section, on which work has now commenced.We are seeing every month the roll-out of projects all over the country. The national development plan has been an enormous success and it will continue right up to the end of 2006. It would be nice to be able to put more resources into these projects, to be even further ahead of our European colleagues, and to compensate for less active periods in the past. That is not possible given the present state of finances. However, in this year's budget, Deputy Brennan was granted a further €209 million for roads alone, bringing road expenditure up to €1.25 billion. That is just one area of the national development plan and there are many others being successfully implemented.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	20	When did responsibility for co-ordinating the national development plan transfer from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Finance? Who is the project manager? There has to be somebody who has a desk upon which the buck stops. Will the Taoiseach tell us who it is?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Department of Finance was the co-ordinator of the NDP since it was launched in November 1999. I chair the cross-departmental Cabinet team and continue to be responsible for it. There is no single official responsible for projects related to roads, marine, transport or aviation. There is no dictatorial position. Each Minister is responsible for the capital projects within his or her Department. That has always been the case and continues to be so. The Secretary General of each Department and the relevant officials are the Accounting Officers for the various projects. That is the sensible approach. The overall monitoring of the sums spent is co-ordinated by the Department of Finance.

Would the Taoiseach explain to the House the purpose of that change? Is it the case that the housing element has been a feature of address by the cross-departmental team? Does it mean that housing will have a greater priority as a result of this change? Following the last budget, certainly in respect of social housing, it has been given a less important status given the reduction in funding to local authorities for the provision of social housing.

Is this indicative of housing becoming more the preserve of the private sector? Is the Cabinet considering a reduced role for, or perhaps even the squeezing out of, local authorities in the provision of social housing?Has the cross-departmental team or the Cabinet sub-committee dealt with the issue of public private partnerships for the construction of incinerators at a number of locations, including Carranstown, despite the well-recorded public disquiet both on health and waste management grounds?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The housing element is included in the scope of the cross-departmental team because it is not possible to build houses without the roads, water and sewerage schemes. The water aspect alone accounts for €4.4 billion. Co-ordinating very large and substantial contracts is better done on a cross-departmental basis. The work in preparing and servicing land along with other initiatives is allowing us to build a record number of houses this year for the eight or ninth year in a row. This year the figure will be about 60,000 houses. The purpose is to give meaningful effect to being able to implement the policy across Departments. Housing always gets the highest priority, which is why we are at the current level of construction across a range of house types.There have been presentations on incineration and waste water issues. The Deputy should table a question to the relevant Minister.

Why has the Cork School of Music disappeared from the agenda of those meetings, in view of the fact that it is a public private project? Many statements have been made by the Taoiseach and his Ministers that EUROSTAT is blocking the project. EUROSTAT claims it has not been consulted nor has it given an opinion on the project.

The meeting looked at policy areas. Some of the individual projects and schemes were also discussed. The Deputy knows there are quite a number of different schemes. There are different private sector schemes currently in the pipeline and at planning stages. We also looked at some of the EPA initiatives on this area, some staffing changes in the EPA and some proposals about who will deal with those and how they will be dealt with in future. It was a general discussion. There were some individual projects mentioned, but I was not involved in the detail of them.

We are now moving into an era where a small number of large companies will control all of these services within ten years. This will mean the consumer will be fleeced. Every household and business will have enormous charges placed against them. Are we not heading down a road where privatisation and selling off these services to international groups will become evident in this State? Will the Taoiseach also agree that the Government should not lose sight of the loss of local authority involvement in these essential facilities? Are these issues of concern to the Taoiseach and his cross-departmental team?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I do not claim to be an expert in this field, but what has emerged at the committee is that most of these companies are involved in the operation of contracts. These are major contracts with major companies and major investment. The overall contract in the Dublin water treatment scheme is €300 million. In the State under the national development plan, the amount of investment by these companies amounts to €4.4 billion.I take the Deputy's point that one does not want to lose the local authority involvement in this area. However, the Dublin water treatment scheme that is just completed, is considered to be the best in the world. That now sets the standard for the rest of the State, not alone to go beyond EU standards but to go higher than those. The intention is to replicate that on a nationwide basis but not to the same extent, because the Dublin plant has a capacity to take 30,000 tonnes more and cope for 1.6 million people.One will only get public private partnership involvement if the investment is of a substantial size. In the smaller schemes, there will be no interest from the large private sector companies. They tend to be conglomerates but the local authorities have a key role in these developments. In the case of the Dublin plant the local authority is the regulator. I am sure the same is true with other local authorities where private sector companies are the operators. That is probably the way forward in this area.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The design, build and operate system, which is being hived off completely to these companies, will remove the element of local authority involvement. Previously, it was a case of design, get departmental approval, seek tenders and have the local authority operate the project, but now it is design, build and operate for 20 years, in which case, the charges will escalate and county managers will have no option but to pass this cost on to consumers. The extension to water or sewerage schemes will be at the companies' discretion and the charges may be exceptionally high. This is a dangerous precedent. The cross-departmental team to which the Taoiseach referred should be cognisant of what can happen in five, ten or 15 years if this trend continues.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I accept that care will have to be taken. The local authority engineers are still involved in the projects and they still have to approve them. This approach was taken in order for us to get up to EU standards and to generate the necessary critical mass to get ahead. I think everyone agrees that such an approach was required. The Dublin water treatment scheme is world class. It is of a higher standard than the one in the USA, which was previously considered to be number one. I do not think the State would be capable of doing that to the same high standard or to get the big players involved.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Dermot Lacey is still alive anyway.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	60	This approach allows big operators to come in and assist. Engineers have informed me that the costs of dealing with the entire process of waste water treatment on a stand-alone approach to design, build, finance and management are far less. The input is also reduced in terms of staff, which may not always be desirable, but because of the level of infrastructure, the engineers say that each year the running costs will be lower. Although it is a 20-year period that is involved, if the maintenance costs are built into it, it should mean that the processing is safely done even after the term is up. There is also a built-in bonus as the by-product of the wastewater process can be sold for agricultural use which seems to make commercial sense.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I have a question in response to what the Taoiseach said. Given our historically over-centralised development and the fact that we have the highest per capita car use of any EU member state, does he accept that the infrastructural element of the national development plan will have to be more carefully focused? Perhaps he should be the one driving the process because in view of what he said about line Ministers having responsibility to get on with their job, will he accept that whether it be line Ministers or line dancers there needs to be a choreographer who is focused on making sure everybody is responding to whatever tune is being played? At the moment—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Deputy must ask a question.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	63	—the tune is very energy intensive and unsustainable.The Taoiseach made the comment that public private partnerships are being used for projects that are viable and have an economic return. If that is the case, taking into account the views of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, why could the pension reserve fund not be used if the projects were viable? If the projects are viable for PPP, why not use the pension reserve fund, as this will also result in a return for taxpayers? Surely that is an argument for using it?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The Deputy should confine himself to questions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I am. Is that not an argument for using the pension reserve fund more so than is currently the case? If we are to go further down the PPP route, is there not a clear need for whistle-blowers legislation? The Public Interest Disclosure Act of July 1999 has been found to be most useful in the UK. Had it not existed, there would have been more devastation following from the privatisation of the railways. Is there not a clear need for this kind of legislation in respect of private operators acting in the public interest?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I remind the Taoiseach that there are two other Deputies offering as well.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	67	We appear to be talking about different initiatives. The railway here is operated exclusively by CIE. Connex was awarded a contract in respect of Luas by the RPA and that is the only private operator in terms of rail. As regards sustainable development, the contract we mentioned, namely, the new waste water Dublin project, is the most sustainable contract in the world. There is nothing more sustainable than that.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	68	What about transport?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The Deputy should allow the Taoiseach to reply.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	70	What we must do in the transport area, and we have almost completed on the Dublin-Belfast route, is get direct roadways on the main five routes to cut down travelling times. Whether we have the lowest or the highest number of cars, we must get proper infrastructure on the Dublin-Belfast, Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick and Dublin-Waterford routes. That is our priority and that is why we have spent record amounts of money. We are also providing enormous subsidies. The CIE figure this year is €0.5 billion, of which the lion's share will be spent on rail. The taxpayer is subsidising rail transport to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds. No one is trying to buy our rail service or to get involved in public private partnerships. The challenge for the State is to make CIE as efficient and effective as it can and to continue to modernise it. We have introduced the rail safety programme and new carriages. It is not like the British system and I would not like it to be similar to it. I would like to get the best value, as the Minister is trying to do. We want to take the customer into account to the maximum extent possible. We want to ensure that the huge resources we have provided will give value back to the users of bus and rail in particular.

Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House if the cross-departmental team or the Cabinet sub-committee has addressed the issue of public private partnership involvement in incineration plant construction? What is the current status of those deliberations?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The Taoiseach said in his earlier reply that he chairs the Cabinet sub-committee on the national development plan. How frequently has that committee met? Is there an official in his Department with explicit and total responsibility for co-ordinating that committee? Has that committee always taken the overview of the projects or was some transfer made in the past couple of years to the Department of Finance? What, if any, is the relationship between that committee and the co-ordinating and monitoring committee in the Department of Finance to which he referred?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	73	As regards Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, there is no funding available for or given to private sector projects. However, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency must ensure that they regulate any projects in this area. They have a deep interest in any such projects. The State does not give money to the public private partnerships the Deputy mentioned.As regards Deputy Quinn's questions about the overview, the Department of the Taoiseach co-ordinates the work across Departments. There is a named official in my Department who acts as the co-ordinator. The meetings are always held once a month. There are sub-meetings held on different projects and the cross-departmental team of officials meets every month. There is at least a meeting at ministerial level with officials and a meeting of officials. The Department of Finance is represented on that committee. It co-ordinates all aspects relating to the contracts signed, the expenditure approved, overruns and any other initiatives. The individual in my Department co-ordinates all the other Departments.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.At the end of May 2003 there were 22,769 participants in the community employment programme countrywide. By the end of the year this number will have been reduced to 20,000. Participation levels on CE are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. All health service-related CE projects, including those providing services for persons with disabilities, have been ring-fenced from reductions that have taken place as a result of reducing the CE programme to 20,000 places by the end of 2003. Other ring-fenced services include drugs task force activities and child care service provision. Projects in RAPID areas are given priority. During 2002 when CE places were being reduced, FÁS ensured that these designated health CE places were untouched and that the places were maintained as agreed.I understand the difficulties being encountered by sponsor organisations, which may have difficulty in replacing participants due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. Although CE is an active labour market programme and the concept of progression by participants is central to such a programme, I have asked FÁS to make a particular effort to identify CE participants suitable for the positions in question.A number of reviews of CE are currently under way. The PPF provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. The outcomes of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of these programmes.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Minister must be aware of the unanimous agreement of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that participants in CE schemes who are working with people with disabilities should continue to work on those schemes. The Minister obviously took fright when he saw the protest outside the House because in recent hours he has been on the phone to various disability organisations, giving reassurance that he would review these matters. He has had since last October to do this, however, and we have been receiving the same answers since then to our questions about the dismantling of the community employment schemes. We were told that the places of people working in this area would be ring-fenced, as would their funding.This is European Year of People with Disabilities. In light of the great success of the Special Olympics and the increased awareness of the disability movement arising therefrom, and taking account of the promises that were made with regard to mainstreaming of disabled groups and places on CE schemes, will the Minister of State give an undertaking to all disability groups that the 207 personal assistants will be allowed to continue their work through the community employment schemes and that the funds for these groups will be ring-fenced as promised?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I assure the Deputy that I have not been on the phone to any disability group in the past number of hours or days.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The Minister of State sent his instructions by bush telegraph.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I have met representatives of a number of disability groups over recent months, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, whose representatives I met last week and again yesterday. I assured them, as I assure the House, that the community employment places for the Irish Wheelchair Association and other groups in the caring and health areas have been ring-fenced. That has never changed. The difficulty to which the Deputy is referring is that the Irish Wheelchair Association has not been able to find people to fill the places available.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	80	That is ridiculous.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	81	It needs 75 people to fill the ring-fenced places. I assured them that FÁS would make a specific effort through the employment services to find 75 people who are suitable to take up those positions.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	82	All the Minister of State has to do is change the existing rules.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	83	There is no need to change the rules. People have been concerned about the reduction in the numbers on such schemes but in the area of disability we have not reduced the numbers.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Minister of State has.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	85	We have left them as they are and they are ring-fenced. I have assured the Irish Wheelchair Association that we will try to find people for the positions. If it is not possible to find 75 people to take up the available positions, I will certainly review the situation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Remove the capping rule.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	87	In some parts of the country, where the Irish Wheelchair Association had not filled places in six weeks, the local FÁS office barred them from doing so afterwards. I was not aware of that but I have clarified the matter with FÁS so that situation will not recur.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	88	After all the months during which we have been addressing this issue, will the Minister acknowledge that these positions are not ring-fenced? It is a misnomer to say the position is ring-fenced when the people providing that service are forced off the scheme. That is pretending the situation is other than it really is. The Minister of State is insisting that people who have been providing personal services should be replaced by others. Will he acknowledge that care assistants are no longer available to many people who have availed of their services up to now? Will he give the House an assurance that he will revisit this matter now, rather than doing so at some future date when he has trawled the country? People who in the past, have had personal support services provided through CE schemes should continue to be provided with such services until a suitable person is found under the revised scheme. In other words, the cap should be removed now and a trawl should be undertaken to find a replacement who fits the new criteria. Until such a replacement is found, the Minister of State should instruct FÁS that nobody should be without that support.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	89	As I have stated, we have to replace people who leave a scheme with new people.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Minister of State is forcing people off the scheme.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	91	That has been the essential element of CE since it was founded by the Deputy's colleague a number of years ago.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Yes, it is an excellent scheme.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Minister is extending it.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I informed the Irish Wheelchair Association, as I have informed every other group, that the essence of the scheme is to progress people on to permanent employment at the end of the CE scheme.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	95	One in five places is being cut.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I am quite confident that in this case the problem can be solved.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	98	They are back on the dole.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Yesterday, I assured the Irish Wheelchair Association that where it is not possible to find a replacement for a person who is coming to the end of a CE scheme, on a case by case basis, I will be prepared to consider the possibility of that person being retained until it is possible to find a replacement. I have asked FÁS to be flexible in that regard. The complaint made in this House was that large numbers of people are being made redundant and becoming unemployed.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Is the Minister of State denying that?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I find it difficult to understand that, and if that is the case – I accept it is – we cannot get people to fill the 75 places that are now vacant across the country.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Minister of State should undertake another tour of the country to find out what is really happening because he admitted that in the past six weeks he has learned something about FÁS schemes that he did not know already. Perhaps he was not informed by his Department or FÁS. There is a hidden agenda by FÁS and the Department to get rid of the community employment programmes. That has been going on for the past few months and no amount of reviews, position papers or internalising in the Department can get away from that fact. Does the Minister of State understand that people caring for the disabled cannot be replaced easily because their work is tailored to the requirements of those with disabilities? Resource centres for independent living and many other community facilities have had the benefit of providing work experience for the disabled to get them into training and employment.This is an uncaring attitude by the Government but if the political will was there the matter could be resolved. The Minister of State has provided a chink of light by saying he will examine cases individually. He should meet the requirements set down in the programme for Government which stated that places for the disabled would be ring-fenced. If the rules need to be changed and the cap lifted on years of participation, the Minister of State should take the initiative by doing that immediately.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Does the figure of 75 which the Minister of State gave apply to the Irish Wheelchair Association?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Yes.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Does the Minister of State accept that there are other groups which are also in difficulty? Does he have an accurate figure of people with disabilities whose services are under threat of being removed before the end of the year? If so, will he provide that figure for the House? Will he give an assurance that a direction will be given to FÁS that nobody will lose their personal assistants under this new scheme until a replacement has been found?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I do not have those figures with me but I will make them available to the Deputy. Many of those employed by the Irish Wheelchair Association are drivers, caretakers and carers who should be able to progress to full-time employment and others should have an opportunity to replace them. That is the situation and will remain so.In respect of Deputy Hogan's allegation that we are trying to do away with CE schemes, the review has now been completed and I will be taking the proposals to Government shortly. We will have a new CE programme providing for an enhanced labour market initiative to get the long-term unemployed into an even more intensive training programme followed by progression to employment. We will also have a programme to provide a much more structured and significant service to the community, right across the spectrum, which in respect of CE will be part of Government policy for the first time. It will help us to go forward with a community employment scheme that will serve the needs of the unemployed in progressing towards employment, as well as serving the needs of communities, including carers, environmental workers and local authority workers.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 181, 186 and 187 together.Higher Government charges did not account for over 50% of inflation in the past year. As the Forfás report clearly states the Government-influenced category includes excisable products where price increases have occurred without any increase in excise duties. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the contribution was due to increased tobacco duties, which were more than justified. I deplore the cynical use of this analysis by vested interests to deflect attention from the need to ensure greater competition across the economy.I fully accept that inflation is a problem and that all businesses are affected by inflationary pressures. Furthermore, the disequilibrium between our inflation level and such levels elsewhere in Europe has the potential to undermine our internationally traded sectors, in particular, and to put at risk employment and growth. I therefore welcome the sharp decrease in annual inflation to 3.7% in May.The key to bringing inflation down is to improve competitiveness. The Government is already taking measures to improve our competitiveness in key areas. These include: strengthening competition across the economy and implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas, such as insurance; increasing investment in research, technology and innovation, which will provide the basis for future growth in productivity; and continuing to invest in key infrastructure, such as broadband telecommunication.On the specific issue of enterprise competitiveness, Enterprise Ireland has recently introduced a special competitiveness fund which is designed to help firms improve productivity and strengthen their overall competitiveness.All economic stakeholders have their responsibilities in tackling inflationary pressures. The Government for its part will meet its responsibilities and its actions will be informed by advice from, for example, the National Competitiveness Council, as manifested in its recent statement on inflation, and by the anti-inflation initiative provided for under the national agreement, Sustaining Progress.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Forfás indicated in the report it published a number of weeks ago that Government-imposed charges contributed to the high rate of inflation. It is not surprising that Forfás referred to them because since the votes were counted at the last general election, €35 has been imposed on every household in additional charges such as VAT, energy, diesel and motor taxes and health and waste fees. This figure does not include insurance charges, for which the Government does not have direct responsibility but on which it has been slow to act.The Minister of State should acknowledge the major contribution these high costs are making to job losses on a daily basis. Yesterday was "Black Monday" and over the past week more than 800 jobs have been lost in Donegal, Navan, Macroom and Westmeath. No new proposals were produced by the Minister or the Department following the much-heralded Cabinet meeting in May to suggest there is an understanding of the difficulties faced by small businesses and other companies that export or how major infrastructure and broadband technology developments can be fast-tracked to make the economy competitive and reduce costs.What new initiatives will be undertaken by Government to address the increasing lack of competitiveness following the Cabinet meeting that was expected to address these issues and produce proposals in early May?

The report comprised two main elements – a comparative analysis of consumer prices in Ireland and the other 15 EU member states and an analysis of the major product service drivers of consumer price inflation in Ireland in recent years. Chapter 3 set out an analysis of the national drivers of inflation in Ireland and the finding, which received much publicity and was highlighted by the media, was that more than 50% of national inflation was accounted for by Government influenced customer product services.The report, however, went on to warn that this figure needed to be treated with caution.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The report spelt out that the contribution of such goods and services to national inflation in recent years had been largely driven by goods that are subject to excise duty and that, while the Government has the potential to influence their price, a closer examination of developments in excise duty over the period under review suggested that the Government played a relatively minor role in driving inflation in this category over the past three years. For example, important items in the expenditure category such as beer and wine were not subject to excise duty increases. There were small increases in the excise duty on spirits but their prices increased significantly.A review of month-on-month inflation demonstrates that price hikes in the immediate aftermath of a change in excise duty are often higher than those intended by the change and regularly monthly changes in prices may not be attributable to tax changes. The Forfás report shows clearly that Government driven changes did not cause increases in inflation.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	124	While a number of large organisations have self-insured for many years, I am aware of reports that more companies are self-insuring. This does not involve complete self-insurance in many cases, as the company carries the risk up to a certain financial limit with cover in place against large liabilities. Public or employer's liability insurance cover, while not compulsory, is advisable to safeguard the solvency of the enterprise in the event of claims for damages or personal injury. Companies deciding to self-insure need to consider their risk exposure very carefully.On 25 October last, the Minister announced a comprehensive programme to reform the insurance market and drive down premiums both for businesses and consumers in general. The programme comprises an interrelated set of measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market.The key measures include implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe. To date, 15 recommendations have been implemented and work is progressing on the implementation of the other recommendations: the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board – the Government has recently approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing and it is hoped to enact the legislation by year end; a civil liability and courts Bill to be introduced by the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, which will include measures to deal with spurious or exaggerated claims and improve the functioning of the court system in dealing with insurance litigation; a new road safety strategy to reinforce the impact of penalty points is being formulated by the Minister for Transport; and, finally, my Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.The Minister chairs the ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of this reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. The pricing and underwriting of insurance, however, is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents governments from intervening in regard to premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite.Additional Information.Insurers generally make decisions about whether they are prepared to quote for a particular risk and, if so, at what premium level, based on their underwriting experience or assessment of that risk in the market. The Minister has made it clear that she considers there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure the reforms being undertaken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to businesses and consumers.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Did the Minister of State read the evidence given to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business when it dealt with this matter? Did he read in the national media the passionate and trenchant comments made by representatives of the business sector, particularly those of my county man, Liam Griffin? Is he aware of the risk such people are forced to carry? Is he aware that his comments that Mr. Griffin and all the others who are self-insuring should consider their risk exposure carefully will drive them to distraction? These people cannot sleep at night because they are considering carefully their risk exposure. However, because there has been no action from the Government, which has been continually in office for six years, to deal with the issue of spiralling insurance rates, these people are at their wit's end. They will be driven to distraction when they read tomorrow that the Minister advises them to consider carefully their risk exposure.Will the Minister acknowledge, as the hotels federation has told the committee, that insurance premiums have risen by 351% for guest houses and hotels in the past three years? It is all well and good for him to say that these reports are coming and all these reviews are happening, but we are still at the drafting stage of a Bill for the personal injuries assessment board. We have not seen sight nor light of the courts Bill – where is it? It is not good enough for the Government to drag its heels further on this issue which is affecting people who are living day to day on their wits, hoping and praying that there will not be a catastrophic claim against them that will wipe them and their personal houses and family well-being out of existence.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I saw the reports of the meeting in question and had a comprehensive meeting with the chairman of the committee. The Tánaiste and I met the group on one occasion and I met the group separately in the context of my responsibility for health and safety in the workplace. We all agree that premiums being charged by insurance companies, particularly in the past two years, have gone completely out of control. However, the set of measures identified by the task force and the measures now being implemented out I outlined, is the only way to deal with the spiralling cost of insurance. If the Deputy has any other ideas he believes could make an impact, we would all like to hear them.We must face up to the fact that the main reason for the large increases in insurance premiums are the level of claims, particularly spurious exaggerated and false claims. The recent "Prime Time" programme was a good example of rampant fraud, exaggeration and spurious claims being made right across the spectrum. The initiative being taken as a result of the task force report and the range of legislation being introduced in three Departments will comprehensively deal with that problem.There is still the difficulty of competition in the marketplace. The most significant challenge is the joint study being undertaken into the insurance market by my Department and the Competition Authority. I met recently with several insurance companies and it is quite clear that in the past insurance companies lived off the profits of their investment and paid out willy nilly. That is now changing. Cases are being challenged inside and outside the courts and I am confident there will be a reduction in premia. In the meantime, we must acknowledge that people are self-insuring. It is fair to point out, however, that they are self-insuring up to a level and the higher levels of liability are being covered by those companies which are self-insuring.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 117, 131, 149 and 158 together.When the Tánaiste last reviewed the Groceries Order in 2000 she indicated that the grocery sector was changing and that the matter would be kept under review. Since then there have been a number of developments in the sector, in particular the increasing presence of the so-called discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl. The Government, particularly the Tánaiste, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is dedicated to tackling factors which impact negatively on consumers or which contribute to high inflation.The recent Forfás report confirms that inflationary pressures on consumers have increased and Ireland is now the most expensive country in the Eurozone for food. In light of these factors, the Tánaiste has decided to reconsider the operation of the order, in particular the ban on below cost selling. Since she announced that she was reconsidering the order, she has received a significant amount of correspondence from interested groups and individuals seeking retention of the order. She has also met a number of interested parties to discuss their concerns. She is continuing to consider what action, if any, is appropriate in relation to the Groceries Order and I will bear in mind the views of all interested parties, and the interests of consumers, in that regard.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I wish the Tánaiste well and regret she is not able to be here today. I am pleased to hear that she is reviewing the matter. Will the Minister of State say when such a review will be concluded and whether the related issue of retail planning guidelines in terms of the size of stores will be reviewed at the same time? Is this the responsibility of the Tánaiste or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government? Are the two issues connected in any way in terms of the review the Tánaiste is carrying out?Given what has happened in recent years in the Irish retail sector, that is, the introduction of a significant number of new discount store operators such as Aldi and Lidl, is it not strange that the Tánaiste believes inflation is due to lack of competition when the truth is that Government inflationary policies in the two years leading up to the election brought about inflation? Why is the Government trying to blame the retail sector for its economic mismanagement?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I cannot say when the Tánaiste will have a decision but I will relay the message to her. Capping the size of retail outlets is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In relation to inflation, the argument has been put forward that the rate of inflation in the grocery sector is way below the general level of inflation. Therefore any decisions taken by Government in that area did not contribute to the inflationary increases.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	130	In his last response, the Minister said the latest inflation statistics we had at our disposal indicated that food prices have increased by 1.6%, which was approximately half the annual rate of inflation. Why is a review taking place if the Minister believes there is sufficient competition in the grocery trade and prices are below the current annual rate of inflation?In response to Deputy Howlin, the Taoiseach stated on a number of occasions that no review was taking place. What is the position? Is the Tánaiste reviewing the matter off her own bat? Are Fianna Fáil politicians who are going around telling people in retail outlets that no review is taking place wrong or what is the Government's position? Is the Tánaiste doing one thing without telling the Taoiseach? The Taoiseach is misleading the Dáil if that is the case.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The Tánaiste has decided to review the matter and she will make a statement in the near future.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Following from Deputy Hogan's comment, will the Minister of State tell the Taoiseach so that he will know a review is taking place, because he clearly did not know when he answered my question in the House. Is the impact of inflation the only matter that will be considered in the review or will the social implications of removing the Groceries Order also be considered?Is the Minister of State aware that the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business is considering the issue and that the previous committee has reported on the matter? Will the views of the committee be taken into account before the Tánaiste comes to a conclusion?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Consideration will be given to the social impact of a change to the Groceries Order. One argument for retaining the order is that if it were changed and we had below cost selling prices, initially that might be good for the consumer but in the longterm many independent retailers would be blown out of the water by bigger outfits, which would then be in a position to fix whatever price they wanted. The Tánaiste will take note of that.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	145	There is no statutory or common definition of the term "hedge fund". The term is a loose description of many different types of investment funds or investment funds using a variety of investment techniques.Investment funds are usually constituted as investment companies under Part XIII of the Companies Act 1990, as unit trusts under the Unit Trusts Act 1990 or as investment companies or unit trusts coming within the scope of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities or UCITS regulations.Investment funds are subject to authorisation and supervision by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, which is empowered under the relevant legislation to impose any conditions it considers necessary and prudent for the orderly and proper regulation of investment funds. I am informed by the IFSRA that it does not authorise hedge funds per se, but that it has authorised certain types of funds which have some of the characteristics of hedge funds. The authorisation of such funds is subject to conditions designed to protect the investor.I understand from IFSRA that it has authorised approximately 50 such funds, the majority of which are what are known as qualifying investor funds while the remainder are professional investor funds. These funds are subject to certain conditions imposed by IFSRA including, in the case of qualifying investor funds, a minimum subscription requirement of €250,000 and investors are required to meet a net worth test and to certify in writing that they are aware of the risks involved in the investment. There are no limits on the investment strategies adopted. In the case of professional investor funds, the minimum subscription requirement is €125,000 and the investment strategies adopted are subject to limits.I am further informed by IFSRA that following submissions from the Irish funds industry and in keeping with IFSRA's own view of the evolution of fund regulation in Ireland, it has indicated to the industry that it is prepared to consider the authorisation of investment funds with hedge fund characteristics at retail level subject to certain investor protection safeguards being incorporated in the product. I understand, however, that no such funds have been authorised by the authority to date. Furthermore, the authority does not consider it appropriate to authorise retail funds engaging directly in hedge fund strategies.Additional informationAll investment funds authorised by IFSRA, whether or not they have some hedge fund characteristics, are subject to monthly reporting requirements in addition to more detailed six monthly reports and fully audited annual reports.Aside from introducing new regulations implementing the UCITS management directive, I have no plans to introduce further regulation of investment funds. However, if IFSRA considers it necessary to strengthen the existing regulatory regime, it will make appropriate proposals to me in this regard.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The last part of the reply is the most important, with the Minister of State effectively saying we do not intend to regulate such hedge funds, though certain funds with the characteristics of hedge funds might be regulated in a separate category.To help the Minister of State, the Oxford English Dictionary defines a hedge fund as one which minimises and protects against loss by counterbalancing one transaction, such as a bet, against another. That is the basic definition. One is placing two bets and leveraging that up through huge borrowings to match or extend out the principal that is offered. My concern is that there is a very dramatic increase in activity in the retail sector for Irish investors in these types of hedge funds. There is no doubt they are extremely risky funds in that while they can make very significant returns they can also make dramatic losses, as is shown by the collapse of long-term American capital funds in recent years.We do not necessarily need to apply the same regulations as in the case of pension or mutual funds, which have proper regulations, but the investor should at least know, when getting into such a fund, the nature of the gamble he or she is about to undertake. There should be some sort of performance record available publicly, by State regulation, to show exactly how those funds perform. That does not exist at present and it is a minimum requirement the Minister of State should propose for the safety of Irish investors.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The IFSRA is responsible for the regulation of investment funds. It is empowered under various Acts governing investment funds to impose any conditions it considers necessary and prudent for the orderly and proper regulation of investment funds. The responsibility for giving information, as suggested by Deputy Ryan, is something the IFSRA could consider, as the Government has given it the responsibility for regulation.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Promotion of Ireland and its regions as a location for foreign direct investment is an operational matter for IDA Ireland. I am aware that employment in IDA supported companies in Wexford decreased by 4.5% in 2002. The IDA continues to work closely with existing clients in the county to develop their mandate in Ireland and to win more value-added activities from their parent corporations. A number of client companies such as Lake Region, Equifax, Waters and PFPC are continuing to grow strongly and provide excellent references for potential investors.IDA Ireland has developed an integrated marketing strategy for County Wexford with the objective of increasing the level of inward investment. The strategy includes a focused sectoral and geographical approach for new green field business, coupled with an added value focus for the existing base of overseas industry in the county. It will also include a comprehensive upgrading of IDA Ireland owned land in the county and the provision of new modern facilities to cater for the emerging sectors.IDA Ireland will work towards addressing the various impediments to new inward investment identified in the Wexford Initiative Committee Report, namely, support infrastructure, particularly telecommunications, and skills availability. The IDA will equally continue to be represented on the Wexford Education Initiative and the Wexford Enterprise Initiative as well as the Wexford County Development Board.The right property solutions are critical to the requirements of new overseas industry and IDA Ireland is currently developing a comprehensive land and buildings programme for the 70 acre IDA Business Park at Drinagh on the Rosslare Road. This will include the incorporation of a 20 acre office park, which will specifically cater for the new emerging internationally traded sectors currently being targeted for the town. Planning permission has been sought for the construction of an advance technology building and an advance office building in the park. PFPC, a financial services company, commenced operation in early 2002 on the Drinagh Business Park, and is continuing to expand.In New Ross, the IDA has upgraded the ten acre site at Butlersland to business class standard. Construction of a 27,000 sq. ft high quality advance manufacturing facility was completed recently and is being actively promoted for overseas investment.Additional informationThe IDA is also promoting the 80,000 square foot space available in the Hartmann facility in conjunction with the owners. In Enniscorthy, the IDA has upgraded the five acre IDA industrial site on the Dublin Road to business park standard. A local community based group has recently completed construction of a 20,000 square foot advance technology building which is now being actively marketed by IDA Ireland to overseas clients.I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the IDA in County Wexford, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of attracting additional sustainable overseas investment to County Wexford.

This is 2003 and 7,000 people in Wexford are seeking employment, 3,000 in Wexford town, 1,700 in Enniscorthy, 1,200 in Gorey and 1,300 in New Ross. A succession of businesses and companies have closed down in recent years. Some 360 jobs were lost in Wexford Electronics, 150 in Wexal in Enniscorthy, 50 in Wexford Weaving, 50 in Stena Line, 45 in Weatherglaze and—

What action will the Tánaiste and IDA Ireland take because this is becoming a worrying trend in Wexford? All these jobs have been lost without one being created since this Government came into office. The Tánaiste said not long ago—

When the Tánaiste came into office in 1997, a Coca Cola factory had been planned for Edermine in Enniscorthy. Deputy Howlin and Ivan Yates, as former Ministers, secured that factory for Wexford but the minute the Tánaiste came into office, she took it from under their feet and brought it to Mayo. Not one thing has been done for Wexford since then.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The IDA Ireland strategy for Wexford is as follows. IDA Ireland has developed an integrated marketing strategy for County Wexford with the objective of increasing the level of inward investment. It includes a focused sectoral and geographical approach for the new greenfield business and an added value focus for the existing base of overseas industry in the county. It continues to work closely with existing clients in the county to develop their mandate and to win more value added activities for their parent corporations. It will also include a comprehensive upgrading of IDA Ireland owned land in the county and the provision of new and modern facilities to cater for emerging sectors. As I said, it will work with the existing bodies, including the Wexford Enterprise Initiative Committee, the Wexford Education Enterprise Initiative and the county development board. Wexford has been named as a hub town under the national spatial strategy.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I am sure the 7,000 unemployed people in Wexford will be absolutely heartened by those comments by the Minister of State, which were entirely meaningless. My friend and colleague was wrong when he said no jobs have been created in Wexford under this Government. One significant employer, PFPC, came despite the best efforts of the Government and IDA Ireland which offered it a free factory if it sited in Galway. As one of the principals of the company was from Wexford, she insisted that it be sited there and she has no difficulty saying that publicly.Does the Minister of State accept that Wexford, unfortunately, meets all the criteria for the BMW region but was not included because it was not contiguous with other BMW category counties? It deserves a special focus and status. The Minister of State's reply will give absolutely no comfort to anybody who wants a special initiative for Wexford. What will he do in respect of broadband roll-out? As broadband enters the country through Wexford, it is available right down the middle of the country but the roll-out, which was to commence last year, was cancelled by the Government. We have been promised that it will be completed before the end of this year. When will the roll-out of broadband be completed for Wexford town and the other towns in the county? When will the unique set of circumstances which are, unfortunately, recognised as among the worst in the country, be acknowledged with a jobs announcement for those seeking employment in the county rather than with pious platitudes?

Enterprise Ireland companies invested €1,473,108 in County Wexford and up to 10 June 2003, in less than six months, more than half that amount, €771,584, has been provided. There has been job creation despite the arguments and loud statements by Deputy Kehoe.Broadband comes under the remit of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It is vitally important for the development of employment throughout the country that broadband be rolled out as quickly as possible. As the Deputy is aware, 19 centres are to get it initially and it is moving forward. I hope it will proceed in County Wexford as well because it is vitally important for job creation.

Shops and factories have closed and Navan Carpets closed yesterday with the loss of 230 jobs. Will the Tánaiste and the Minister of State approach management to see what can be done to save the factory? Can he offer any help? What hope can we give to these people? In the past six weeks, more than 500 people have lost their jobs in the Navan area. No new jobs have been created in the area in the past ten years, yet the population has doubled to 25,000. What is the plan of action? There is a 60 acre IDA Ireland park lying idle.

She acknowledges the work of the joint committee in its consideration of insurance reform and is aware it has met various interest groups on the topic. The Tánaiste, myself and our officials have also met various interest groups in relation to the reform programme, including the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board.Furthermore, the general scheme of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill has been published on my Department's website, www.entemp.ie to fuel debate and discussion on the issue. Comments on the proposed legislation are welcome from interested parties.

It may be a bit like the famous solutions of abolishing juries or the two seniors rule.Let me make it clear, as a non-practising lawyer, that I am not against the proposal but the onus of proof is on those who say it is going to work. That has not been done, which is why I am suggesting that the heavyweights from the interests involved – the Insurance Federation, the interim board of the PIAB, the Law Society and the Bar Council – be brought before the enterprise committee of the Oireachtas and allowed to prove their case and answer questions.A precedent has been set in that regard, and I was a member of the all-party committee that held the abortion hearings. That led to a lot of clarity, but there is no clarity on this issue, as far as I can see. There are conflicting views, as well as concerns on the part of legislators like me that no benefit to anybody will arise from this proposal and that it will be just another useless layer of bureaucracy.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	187	One would expect Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, as a lawyer, to say what he says, but there is no doubt that the costs of delivering insurance compensation at present are way above what they should be and way above what they are in any other European country. This is largely due to the costs involved in the present adversarial system.The PIAB is designed to reduce the cost of delivering compensation. As the Deputy will be aware, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board recommended strongly that the PIAB would have a significant impact in terms of reducing the costs of delivering compensation. Legislation is now being prepared by Government and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating when the board is established.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	188	That is the very point – the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I will ignore the rather superficial reference by the Minister of State to my position as a lawyer. I pointed that out to declare an interest, but I speak as a legislator who is anxious to ensure that we have an efficient system here, which we have not got at present. The onus of proof is on those putting forward the view that the PIAB will produce an efficient, cheaper system.That is why I issue a challenge to the Government to bring those who propose that view before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Let those who hold a different view also be brought before the committee. Out of that, let us have clarity and light rather than the leap in the dark that is now being proposed. I am neutral on this issue and have an open mind. If this proposal is going to produce benefits, then so be it, but that has not been proved. My concern is that it is a leap in the dark that will bring no benefit to anybody and that will, as I have said, be just another useless layer of bureaucracy. Bear in mind that anybody who is not satisfied with the decisions of the PIAB cannot even go to court. Where is the advantage, therefore, of having a PIAB?

I am more convinced of the value of the personal injuries assessment board than my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, but when is it envisaged that we will have this enacted? It is not the direct responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, but I ask about the parallel development of a courts (amendment) Bill to deal with the issue of taking sworn affidavits. Will there be a perjury Act, which was also called for in the review?These are vital matters that I have already raised in my priority question. We need action rather than further review, and I hope there will not be further long-winded debate on the merits of this proposal. We need action for the very people I mentioned in my priority question, who cannot continue surviving, month-on-month, with the insurance rates now being heaped upon them.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The resignation of Mr. Justice Flood from the Flood tribunal has clearly caused confusion among the public and in political circles. It is very important that there be absolute clarity about how we proceed from here and what the current position is. Whatever else about their views on the tribunal, it is clear that the public do not want the taxpayer to have to take up the cost of payment of those who were deemed to have clearly obstructed the findings of the tribunal, whether those costs be €10,000 or €10 million.Last week we had some very confusing statements from the Taoiseach and members of Government on this matter. On Tuesday the Taoiseach said that if Mr. Justice Flood did not deal with the costs issue, a question clearly arises. Also on Tuesday, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said that legislation would be required to reduce "as best we can" the risks of legal challenge arising from a new chairman dealing with the costs element. On Wednesday the Taoiseach said that if Mr. Justice Flood did deal with costs, it would avoid legal complications. However, on Friday, following his resignation both as chairman and as a member of the tribunal, the Taoiseach indicated that there are no legal impediments to a new incoming chairman dealing with the issue of costs.I wish to find out from the Taoiseach what, in his best estimation, the position now is. Is it clearly the case that he has discovered that there is no legal restriction or complication, as distinct from impediment, upon a new chairman dealing with the costs element of this tribunal? Any Member of the House might not have a legal impediment imposed upon him or her in dealing with the costs, but it does not remove the element of legal charge after legal charge arising as a consequence.If legislation is necessary, and there is no legal impediment involved, why can we not have this legislation this week and allow the work of the tribunal to continue unimpeded?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Matters have changed a bit over the course of the week. Of course, there is no problem with the tribunal continuing its work. The question of costs is the issue which requires legislation, which can be produced in the autumn. In the course of my statement to the Dáil last Tuesday, I made it clear that the preference of the Government was that Mr. Justice Flood would decide the costs issue. We took the view that if Mr. Justice Flood proceeded to deal with other modules and not address the costs issue for the reasons set out in his letter of 16 June, there would be a risk that persons appearing in these modules could rely on this as a potential ground for legal challenges. Deputy Kenny has quoted me correctly. This was a legitimate point that needed to be addressed. It was because of our concern in this regard that we sought further clarification from Mr. Justice Flood on this aspect of his proposal. However, as I shall shortly demonstrate, the original proposal and the clarification sought by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in connection with it was overtaken by events. I wish to make it clear, as quickly as I can, that the Government had not rejected the proposal in the letter of 16 June but was awaiting clarification. However, the proposal became redundant in the light of what I will now disclose.On 26 June, a meeting took place between the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Flood. The meeting had been sought by Mr. Justice Flood to clarify his position. He stated that he was personally disposed towards dealing with the issue of costs and to continuing on in the tribunal for a further period. He stated his willingness to address the costs issue, notwithstanding the added strains and burden that would impose. There was also a brief discussion about possible future legislative changes to enable the administrative burden of the tribunal that was placed on the chairperson to be reduced by permitting administrative tasks to be delegated to another member of the tribunal. This was to address one of the reasons that was behind the proposal contained in the letter of 16 June and was a mechanism that would assist his continuation in the tribunal.It was agreed that Mr. Justice Flood would return to the tribunal offices for the purpose of sending a letter to the Oireachtas on his future role in the tribunal, as discussed with the Attorney General. I was informed by the Attorney General of this new situation. Later that afternoon, the Attorney General received a telephone call from Mr. Justice Flood who was at the tribunal. During that call, the Attorney General was informed by Mr. Justice Flood that he wanted to reconsider his future role in the tribunal having had further discussions. It was agreed that Mr. Justice Flood would further consider his position overnight. I was informed of this change in circumstances by the Attorney General.Last Friday, 27 June, the Attorney General received a telephone call wherein he was informed by Mr. Justice Flood that he was resigning from the tribunal. A letter was sent to the Oireachtas and copied to the Attorney General. Members of this House have a copy of that letter. There was only one meeting last week between the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Flood.As is clear from the resignation letter, Mr. Justice Flood's decision to resign completely from the Flood tribunal is one which he made in the interests of the tribunal and its work to date and into the future. I understand and appreciate why Mr. Justice Flood has resigned. I wish to state emphatically that media speculation as to reasons for Mr. Justice Flood's resignation is simply incorrect. Members of the House have received his letter of resignation and we should accept and respect this decision.

This meeting concerned the issue of His Honour Mr. Justice Mahon deciding costs as a new chairperson and Mr. Justice Flood becoming an ordinary member. The reasons for this proposed change, as stated at the meeting, were the same as those in the letter of 16 June 2003. Some correspondence additional to that already referred to was exchanged between the Attorney General and the tribunal, and I will make this correspondence available to the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Was any contact made with Mr. Justice Flood directly or indirectly by the Government or persons on behalf of the Government following his initial meeting with and his final response to the Attorney General to the effect that he was resigning both as a member of the tribunal and as chairman, despite his personal disposition to deal with the element of costs? Now that Mr. Justice Mahon is to be in charge of the tribunal, what basis has the Taoiseach for saying that there is no legal impediment to his dealing with costs in view of the fact that he will have to read 37,000 pages of transcripts and understand the nuances, mood and circumstances of the evidence given to a point where any such decision can withstand legal charge after legal charge that may arise from people whose charges have not yet been determined, outside those who are deemed to have obstructed the tribunal in its work?Is the Taoiseach happy to put an end to the speculation rampant in the legal profession that a deal was done originally regarding costs relating to Mr. Ray Burke? Is the Taoiseach happy to endorse what Mr. Justice Finnegan has said about this, that no such deal was done and no such deal exists? Is the Taoiseach happy that Mr. Justice Mahon, upon his assumption of the role of chairman, will be entitled and enabled to deal with the issue of costs once and for all because the taxpayer does not want to have to deal with the issue of payment of costs for those who were clearly deemed to have obstructed the process of finding out the truth and obtaining justice in this matter?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	204	On whether anyone from the Government contacted Mr. Justice Flood, the answer to is "no", aside from Mr. Justice Flood contacting the Attorney General on the occasions I outlined.On the issue of costs, I now have a detailed legal brief from the Attorney General setting out his views on this issue. The Deputy will recall that when I spoke on this issue last Tuesday, I had only received the information a few hours earlier. The Attorney General has now looked at this matter, has taken all aspects into account and is quite satisfied that with the legislative change, this is a creature of statute and what is in statute can be changed. He is quite satisfied, as are, I understand, the members of the tribunal, that this can be dealt with once the legislation is passed. Of course, the tribunal can continue with its other work.Mr. Justice Flood and Mr. Justice Finnegan have said previously that there was no question of any kind of a deal having been done. Deputy Kenny did not raise the following issue but other people have and I, therefore, wish to read into the record a letter I received today from Mr. Justice Flood dated 30 June. It states:Dear Taoiseach,I refer to my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen on the above matter in which the reasons underlining my resignation are set out.I note in the public press statements to the effect that action-inaction by the Government in relation to requests from the tribunal for additional judges or other matters have caused frustration and are the real reason for my resignation.I wish to state categorically that this is not so. My decision is in no way related to or consequent upon any action or inaction by the Government of any kind.My relationship with the Government is through the Department of the Attorney General. I have at all times during my tenure of office had a relationship with the Attorney General's Office that has been exceptionally cordial and co-operative. The allegation that the work of the tribunal has been delayed or frustrated in any way by the Government is completely groundless and has nothing to do with my decision to resign.The reasons for my resignation are solely set out in my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen. I trust this letter clarifies the position.Yours sincerely,Feargus M. Flood.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Can I clarify with the Taoiseach why an issue which seemed very problematic on 24 June is kosher today according to the Attorney General? We know that the Attorney General received the letter on 16 June, even though it was not open to this House until 24 June, so he had plenty of time to consider his opinion. The Taoiseach has now told us that the Attorney General met Mr. Justice Mahon and Ms Justice Faherty on 26 May to discuss what would happen in the matter of costs if Mr. Justice Flood resigned. If the Attorney General was seized of the matter on 26 May, surely he had a clear opinion by the time he went to Cabinet last week in terms of whether the taxpayer is likely to be exposed to horrific costs for people considered to have obstructed the tribunal or that the taxpayer should be responsible for the costs of big time tax evaders. It is an appalling vista. I am sure the Taoiseach agrees with me that if the taxpayer ends up paying €10.5 million fees down the road for Ray Burke, there will be outrage in this country. I am still not clear how the Taoiseach was satisfied that this matter could be handled safely by another judge, as was evident from reports over the weekend. Last Tuesday, when answering questions on this matter, he cast as many doubts over this possibility as did Deputy Kenny and I. What exactly has changed in the interim?Given the changes that the Taoiseach made to the Freedom of Information Act, we will not see the correspondence that was transferred between Government and the Flood tribunal, if there was such correspondence. He has since imposed a regime of charges that means that the ordinary citizen will now be liable for up to €240 if he or she wishes to obtain information. I am not clear why the Government is so intent on undermining the independence of the Freedom of Information Act by way of the further actions the Taoiseach took yesterday.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Unfortunately, Deputy Rabbitte did not listen to much that I said – I said that I would make available the correspondence that was transferred. We can do so if we deem the correspondence as administrative.Last week I came into the House immediately as I believed that was a good thing to do. A Cheann Comhairle, you allowed me to give a detailed account to the House on Question Time and to outline the preliminary views of the Cabinet. Deputy Rabbitte purposely sought to admit that the Attorney General was in the Hague during the week when Mr. Justice Flood's letter was received – I explained to the House that he had returned. The issue of concern was whether difficulties in respect of costs and the heightened possibility of legal challenges would arise if Mr. Justice Flood were not the sole member of the tribunal. The view of the Attorney General was that it possibly would heighten the danger of somebody taking action. That there is a different judge in his place still does not stop someone taking action, but the view of the Attorney General, who has had an opportunity to reflect on the matter and discuss it, is that this fear would be removed by amending the statute, given that the problem is a creature of statute in the first instance. Of course, this does not concern the issue of fees. The House should be very clear that the Attorney General and I have no say regarding what the tribunal decides in respect of fees. That issue is unaffected by these events and it is a matter solely for Judge Mahon and his legal colleagues—
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Is the Taoiseach referring to fees or costs?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Costs. I thank the Deputy – he is correct. Costs are a matter for the tribunal. In the autumn we will change the legislation, and our legal advice is that it is in order to do so. There are a number of reasons for this. Party leaders wanted me to outline them but I would rather not do so because it would only make it easier for others if they wanted to take action. The legal advisers are quite happy that their advice on this issue stands up.The work of the tribunal will continue and in the autumn we will have to give thought to the manner in which we change the legislation. We will change the regulations on Thursday to allow Judge Mahon and his colleague, Judge Keys – the third judge – to come in. The tribunal does not require a fourth judge at this stage. In the autumn we will pass legislation on fees and the tribunal will continue to deal with this issue.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I am still not clear whether the Attorney General was in the Hague. If he discussed the matter with Judge Mahon and Judge Faherty on 26 May to ascertain what would happen regarding costs if Mr. Justice Flood resigned, surely the Attorney General had a fixed view on the matter before the Taoiseach discussed it with the House last Tuesday and after the Cabinet meeting. Surely the Attorney General had made up his mind rather than allowing the Taoiseach to cast doubt on possible infirmity arising from decisions on costs being made by the judge replacing Mr. Justice Flood. The Taoiseach was very clear and said the Government would prefer if Mr. Justice Flood dealt with the issue of costs, yet the letter dispatched on that day in the name of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, made no attempt to persuade Mr. Justice Flood to stay on to decide costs. In fact, it is clear that the letter accepts that Mr. Justice Flood will not deal with costs and, therefore, I am still not clear about this matter.On the basis of the motion on Thursday, has any consideration been given to requiring or permitting the three judges to sit in parallel? The Taoiseach has said, and I ask him to put it on the record of the House, that he regards Gilmartin and Dunlop as one module. Most commentators believe there are many years left in that regard. Why cannot the three judges sit in parallel if we are refurbishing the law to deal with this matter and speed it to conclusion?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	210	On the last question, the module is classified as "A5"– we should be clear that this is the one we are talking about. In the reply to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, last week, the tribunal said it hoped to conclude the module by 31 December 2006, after which the other 14 will be dealt with. That is a matter which can be looked at. As I stated last week, the preferred position of the Government is that Mr. Justice Flood deal with the issue of costs. That remains the case. Mr. Justice Flood recognised this position. There is no doubt that his staying on in a different position would have increased the risks, concern and the possibility of legal action. However, this did not arise because it was overtaken by events. Mr. Justice Flood has resigned and I thank him for almost six years of work. The position has changed and our legal team has examined the implications of this carefully and believes that changing the law will remove that doubt. It does not mean that somebody will not make a legal challenge but the legal team has grounds for believing that this will be the position because time has past and there have been no appeals in the past. I will place the other correspondence in the public domain.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	211	When the Parliament goes into recess it will not reassemble until mid-autumn. It is appropriate, therefore, to ask the Government to answer questions on some major unresolved issues. One of the international issues to which much time was devoted in the Dáil and the international arena was the invasion of Iraq by imperial powers. Almost four months after the invasion and the dispersal of the Iraqi army, and in spite of the many regime leaders and scientists available to the occupying powers, not a shred of evidence has been found of the weaponry that was allegedly regarded as an immediate and mortal threat to western countries and which was believed to be capable of being mobilised in 45 minutes. Does the Taoiseach accept, on reflection, that the claims put abroad by the Bush and Blair regimes about these weapons were fabrications, that the invasion was predicated on a cynical and calculated lie and that the agenda was, after all, the control of oil reserves and the domination of the Middle East? Does he accept in particular that he was implicated in this dishonesty and that he, Deputy Harney and the Minister for Foreign Affairs owe an explanation to the Dáil, before it rises, and to the people for having repeated in the House time and again, as good coin and as fact, claims that are now clearly hollow and unsubstantiated? Does he believe that he should answer to the people why he assisted 40,000 armed US soldiers to invade Iraq on foot of what was clearly a lie?

I ask the Taoiseach not to insult the intelligence of our people by referring to the thousands of innocent Iraqis who were slaughtered by the regime of Saddam Hussein while the Fianna Fáil party and the Government of which they were members did business with that regime. Dictatorship is a reason for a people's insurrection, a people's revolution, but under international law is not a basis for imperialist invasion. I ask the Taoiseach to direct his answer to the point that this Dáil was misled by the Government.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Deputy will recall that both during the periods when Ireland was a member of the UN Security Council and when it was not, we continued to give total support to the efforts of the Council to bring a resolution to this major international dilemma that faced us from September 2002 right through to the Spring.I am grateful to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and to all those who worked hard to try to solve the problems. I found myself in a unique position in which I was able to relay the sentiments of the Security Council directly to President Bush, and to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in Hillsborough. I was glad to be able to do that. We stuck firmly with the UN position, and I am proud and glad we did so. On what was said about weapons of mass destruction, I had no information then that was not in the public domain, and everybody else in this House had the same information. I continually stated that I would not prevent the American administration from using Shannon for fly-over purposes. That was totally compatible with our position and I still believe that.

The Taoiseach and the Government stated that this justified the actions that were taking place. The Taoiseach assisted them, and he now refuses to answer to the Irish people regarding the true situation.I call on the Taoiseach again to explain why he misled Parliament and misled the people. There are Parliamentary inquiries into this issue in Britain and in the United States. I ask the Taoiseach to agree that the Dáil Committee on Foreign Affairs should thoroughly investigate this issue, the use of Shannon by the US military and the claims made by the Taoiseach and the Government. Would the Taoiseach be prepared to go before the committee to offer an explanation? Will he see that the advice of the Attorney General regarding the legality of the Iraqi war will be published in full and put before the Dáil and the Committee on Foreign Affairs? Does the Taoiseach agree that we have an on going disaster for the Iraqi people, the oldest civilisation on earth, now with a pulverised water and electricity system, the occupation forces facing a protracted and intensified insurgency and increased instability in the middle east and it was disastrous from start to finish?A number of Irish citizens who felt so strongly about the slaughter in Iraq and the fact that the Irish Government was partly responsible took direct action against US planes. I ask the Taoiseach to request, on reflection, that the charges against them be thrown out, so that we can have a debate on the real issues and allow the Taoiseach himself to answer to Parliament.

Clearly, a difficult position still has to be resolved there. I hope the presence of UN personnel there will be of assistance not only in a humanitarian way but will help resolve the ongoing difficulties. I still hold firmly to the view that the Irish Government took the correct action. We did not participate in the war. We allowed Shannon to be used, and that was not participation. That was the advice and I stick by that advice.Even though it may take time for them to enjoy a more peaceful life, my main hope is that the people of Iraq following the removal of the dictatorship within which they had to live for the past 20 years will now be able to move on to have a more peaceful life.

I have made the case before that I do not like guillotines, which apply in the cases of Nos. 12 and 19. I do not object to taking No. 11 without debate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	244	There are 12 or 14 guillotines planned this week. To require us to rubber-stamp legislation in this way makes a farce of this House. No. 12 is the introduction of a financial resolution. This may not be done under Standing Orders since it imposes a charge on the people. The Bill is at Report Stage. I presume either the Minister will try to recommit or it is not in order. This is no way for us to be asked to do business. To introduce at this stage a financial resolution as an amendment to a matter relating to the protection of the environment is not acceptable and, therefore, I am opposing it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I expected that we would deal with each of these items separately. No. 11 is on the Order Paper to allow the committee to sit during July. However, No. 12 is different. It is farcical to ask for agreement on both items together and it calls into question the integrity of this House. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	246	You are only being asked whether the items will be taken without debate. It is not in order to make a statement on the substance of them.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I am opposing the manner in which we are being asked to rubber-stamp items that are quite different and that need to be taken individually. Given that the Protection of the Environment Bill is at Report Stage we should get an explanation on that Stage about this matter rather than having it put to us in this manner, whereby it is lumped in with another committee. This does not address the real issue.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I object to the fact that we are being asked to take both of these together on the spurious grounds that both propositions entail being taken without debate. They are two entirely different issues, the establishment of the joint committee on the Constitution and a financial resolution connected to a Bill that has not yet made its passage through the Oireachtas. It is absurd. For the Minister's information, I have no objection to the detail of the financial resolution. However, the procedural approach in having the resolution taken before Report and Final Stages conclude has no validity. On both counts, I object strongly.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The resolution must be moved before the Minister recommits the Report Stage amendment – it is precisely so that he can recommit it and the debate can then be taken. We do not like pressing measures through, but we are reaching the end of the session. After tonight we will have had almost 28.5 hours of debate on the Protection of the Environment Bill. Extensive time has been allocated to it.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I object to the guillotining of the Bill, which is a trojan horse for major legislation which will erode the powers of councillors. In effect, it is transferring powers from councillors to managers in respect of the raising of refuse charges. The Minister has already indicated an intention to push through a proposal to charge the economic rate. As a result of the Bill people will be paying between €600 and €700 per annum in charges.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	261	On behalf of the Labour Party, I object to the guillotining of this legislation. Some 158 amendments are tabled for Report Stage of the Bill, for which, at most, two or two and a half hours is being allocated for debate in this House. The Bill is controversial. Certain issues arose on Committee Stage, including the charging regime, the transfer of powers to county managers and the changes in the licensing regime on which commitments were given that amendments would be brought back on Report Stage, or on which there would be extended discussion. That cannot happen in the period of time allowed.In addition to that, the Government is introducing new amendments to the Bill, one of which is eight pages long. This, effectively, amounts to a new item of legislation, which has not been debated on Second Stage or Committee Stage.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	267	It is a recycled Bill.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Some 28 hours have been allowed.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	272	In reality, Second Stage was truncated and it is intended to truncate Report Stage. Most of the debate has been on Committee Stage. It has been pointed out that additional legislative elements are being put before the House in terms of new ministerial amendments. The time being provided is not sufficient. We do not believe the alleged urgency on the part of the Government, that this is legislation that needs to be passed before the end of this session. We oppose this proposal.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	273	Sinn Féin also opposes the guillotining of the Bill. A total of 158 amendments have to be addressed over a mere two and a half hours. The Taoiseach referred earlier to the number of hours that had been spent on the Bill. The tragedy is that the Government will force this through the House. The consequences of many of the propositions within the Bill, in addition to the Minister's new amendment, will be catastrophic in terms of local democracy. This will further erode the powers of locally elected and locally accountable representatives, placing more power in the hands of city and county managers, and in critical areas that will affect the daily life condition of ordinary people. The guillotining of this Bill is absolutely unacceptable and we wholly reject it.

I have no other mechanism through which to reflect on the absolute unacceptability of the Minister's approach in introducing some 32 pages of amendments which practically constitute a new Bill. This is outrageous. Elements that have not been addressed on Second Stage—

On 16 June, the Minister introduced 32 pages of proposed Committee Stage amendments, some dealing with matters completely unrelated to those discussed on Second Stage. They included draconian provisions, many of which, both in my opinion and the opinion of other Deputies, violate Ireland's international obligations regarding the protection of refugees.

There was limited time for Deputies to peruse the Minister's proposals and to prepare amendments. It is unacceptable that the Bill should proceed in this manner, particularly given the outworking of the Minister's proposals.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Today is the only occasion on which we will have an opportunity to raise this matter. The Taoiseach will recall that about three weeks ago, I raised a similar question about the Temporary Release of Prisoners Bill. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had grafted totally extraneous material onto the legislation, which would have had the effect of putting Irish citizens in prison in this jurisdiction without question, on foot of a request from any regime from Turkey, to Afghanistan or the USA. The Taoiseach had the good grace to withdraw the proposal and ensure that the Bill was recommitted, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is now doing.The original Bill was only 14 pages long, yet the amendments tabled two weeks ago were 34 pages long. Last night another ten pages of amendments were tabled, all of which have changed dramatically the nature of the Bill. The Seanad has already completed its consideration of the Bill and will not have an opportunity to discuss the substance of the new amendments. In addition, tomorrow's debate on the Bill in this House is to be guillotined. With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I am asking the Taoiseach to have this Bill recommitted also, so that we can have a proper Second Stage debate.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I made that change a few weeks ago but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been working over a long period to get the Bill through. He is anxious to get it through in this session. We have spent 23 hours and 40 minutes on the Bill, including a Committee Stage debate which lasted for 15 hours and 30 minutes over four days. There are some new aspects to it but we have to try to get it passed.

When will No. 111 on the list of promised legislation, the critical infrastructure Bill, be published, or has it too hit a bottleneck just like Dublin's traffic?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The legislation is being prepared and a memorandum for Government will be submitted shortly seeking approval for the draft heads of the Bill.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	345	What is the status of the proceeds of corruption Bill? It was the centrepiece of the Government's previous legislative programme but seems to have slipped off the radar since then. It should have added interest in view of the changes happening in what was previously referred to as the Flood tribunal. The Taoiseach has indicated that the legislation might be incorporated into a newer Bill so is it still intended to present it to the House in that fashion or will we see it in the form that was originally promised by the Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The proceeds of corruption Bill is aimed at further targeting white-collar crime. Preliminary consultations have taken place with the Office of the Attorney General and the Criminal Assets Bureau. Changes in the law contemplated for this Bill may be included in amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, so I think both Bills will be taken together.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Some time ago when discussing secondary legislation, I asked the Taoiseach if the Government was reviewing the groceries order. The Taoiseach told the House then that no such review was contemplated. During Question Time, however, Deputy Harney confirmed that she is reviewing the groceries order. Is there a Government policy on this matter and when will the review be completed?

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	349	We might get a better answer from the Taoiseach.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The question was for the Taoiseach and I asked him whether there was a review. I presume that legislation that is being reviewed involves the Government, or is this an initiative of Deputy Harney?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	351	What I stated then, and will reiterate now, is that there is no legislation pending on this issue.

The Government is blithely facilitating these increases without taking into account the fact that many people on modest incomes are struggling to keep their payments going. When does the Taoiseach intend to introduce the Voluntary Health Insurance Board (corporate status) Bill? It has been stated that the Bill's purpose is to alter the corporate status of the VHI without any definition as to what it means.

I wish to draw your attention, a Cheann Comhairle, to Standing Order 130 which states: "On Fourth Stage, no new section or other amendment may be proposed which creates a charge on the public revenue or upon the people but the Bill may be recommitted in respect of any such section or amendment". This financial resolution relates to charges which the Minister proposes to make on Report Stage, which we have not yet reached. It is quite clear that no such charge may be made on Report Stage. I appreciate that there is a provision whereby the section relating to the charge may be recommitted but we are unlikely to reach amendment No. 132 which proposes this charge and, therefore—

Standing Order 130 is explicit in that a new section proposing a charge may not be made on Fourth Stage. This Stage has not been taken. A motion to recommit has not been tabled and, in advance of such a motion, a financial resolution relating to a Fourth Stage amendment that proposes to raise money is out of order.

Even if we were to blink these amendments through, we would be unlikely to reach that amendment before the debate concludes, in which case a motion to recommit that section cannot be taken. Second, at the very least, the financial resolution should await the decision of the House in regard to a motion for recommittal because Standing Order 130 is absolutely explicit. It states that on Fourth Stage no new section or other amendment may be proposed that creates a charge on the public revenue. The documentation on the motion explicitly states that it relates to a Fourth Stage amendment. Since a Fourth Stage amendment that results in a charge cannot be tabled, this financial resolution is out of order and may not be taken.

However, it is a procedural issue whereby amendments tabled by the Minster may be accepted. Amendments containing certain material are ruled out of order by Standing Orders for good reasons.

In this case the Minister has tabled an amendment that proposes to levy a charge on the people, which is out of order under Standing Order 130 and may not be in order until such time as the section has been recommitted to Committee Stage and debated. I am in your hands, a Cheann Comhairle, because the Chair rules on these matters, but the financial resolution with which the House is dealing is out of order in two respects and the guillotine relates to the Bill, not the financial resolution. The financial resolution is out of order in two respects because—

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I move:That in accordance with Standing Order 128 (1), the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 be recommitted in its entirety.Standing Orders permit me to explain why I move this motion. This is a controversial Bill, as we know, which will allow county managers to increase charges and provides for transfer of the power to make charges from elected representatives to unelected officials. It also provides for very significant changes in the licensing regime.On Committee Stage we asked the Minister to provide certain information to us, particularly on section 30, which provides for the economic cost of operating waste facilities. The Minister has circulated some information but it is inadequate and this section has not been teased out adequately in the absence of the information we need from the Minister.Also, the Minister has circulated some very significant amendments which were not discussed on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 132 is eight pages long and relates to the recovery of end of life vehicles. It amounts to new legislation and has not been subjected to either Second Stage debate or Committee Stage discussion, yet it is being introduced on Report Stage. There is no justification for the introduction of this amendment on Report Stage. It is based on an EU directive which was signed on 18 September 2000, almost three years ago. The Government has had almost three years in which to introduce legislation to give effect to the directive but has not done so. It has been given plenty of opportunity to address this matter, as in the past three years my party colleagues and I have put down several parliamentary questions to the Minister and his predecessor asking what they intended to do with the directive and how they intended to deal with end of life vehicles. We received answers for the past three years about voluntary arrangements to be negotiated with the industry and so on. It is unacceptable to the House that at the eleventh hour – literally – the Government has now introduced a very substantial amendment of this kind on Report Stage and seeks to have it debated. It may well be that we do not disagree on the issue itself, as I have indicated that I want end of life vehicles dealt with. In fairness to everyone, including those outside the House who may have an interest in the issue and those in the motor trade, it is not acceptable that the Government is using the instrument of an eleventh hour amendment to bring in this issue. We are unlikely to reach amendment No. 132 before the debate is guillotined, so the option of recommitting the section is not open to us.The Government has introduced a second substantial amendment which has not been subjected to a Committee Stage debate in amendment No. 112. This amendment proposes to substitute a new subsection for a subsection in the original text of the Bill. The subsection in the original text is in turn substituting for a subsection inserted by the 2001 Act, which in turn substituted for an earlier subsection in the Waste Management Act 1996. At the very least this is complex and technical legislative material which has not been subject to Committee Stage and is not appropriate to a guillotined Report Stage. Moreover, the subject matter of the amendment requires Committee Stage debate; the amendment proposes making waste management plans, which will now be made by city and county managers, supersede the provisions of development plans which are made by the elected members of local authorities. I draw particular attention to paragraph (b)(i) of the amendment, in which it is proposed that where a conflict arises between the objectives in a waste management plan and those of a county development plan, the objectives of the waste management plan will supersede the county development plan.In practical terms, in the case of a proposal in my constituency to situate a landfill dump in a high amenity area, if that provision is in a waste management plan it will supersede the objectives of the county development plan to protect and preserve the high amenity area. This is a highly significant change in the country's planning laws which in effect will allow a closed loop to exist. A county manager proposing a waste facility can have that facility supersede the county development plan made by his elected members and, at the end of that cycle, end up being the same county manager who decides on the planning issues involved. It is a major change in planning law which the public will only discover when there is a proposal for a landfill, incinerator or some other waste facility that causes them concern. They will learn there is no protection in the provisions of their county development plan.

It is clear the Government proposes major new measures in the Bill which have not been considered on Committee Stage or even debated on Second Stage. We need to have a thorough Committee Stage debate on the Bill's provisions.

If the Deputies opposite wish to remove many of the amendments which have already been discussed and get down to these two principal new amendments, we will have plenty of time to discuss them. I am in the hands of the Members opposite in this regard but I will certainly not recommit this entire Bill to Committee Stage.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, line 5, after "ACT" to insert "TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A POLICY OF WASTE STABILISATION IN IRELAND BY 2010 AND ZERO WASTE BY 2020;".This is quite a compilation of amendments the Ceann Comhairle has read out for us and, as I think he might agree, they are quite diverse. They deal with everything from reserved functions of local authorities in dealing with waste plans to incineration and the need to have waste plans that do not include incineration.Following the last debate we had on the additions to the Bill due to the Minister's belated realisation that the amendment on end of life vehicles must be included in the Bill, we are dealing with very diverse issues. The amount of time being given for Report Stage is nothing more than derisory, given the complexity of many of the issues we are being asked to discuss and vote on.The Minister owes us an explanation as to why on Report Stage, when we are supposed to be wrapping up, consolidating and making cogent changes arising from Committee Stage proceedings, we have been landed with this political bombshell by way of belated amendments. For the Minister to suggest that if we were to do away with all of the other amendments, he would then find the time to explain to us why he is including so belatedly the end of life vehicles amendment is, again, adding insult to injury. It is as if to suggest that the amendments that have been tabled—

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I am indeed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The Minister is suggesting that an amendment such as my one to provide for the implementation of a policy of waste stabilisation in Ireland by 2010 and zero waste by 2020 can simply be dismissed. The reality is that other countries around the world have found a way and, indeed, consider it important to find a way, to develop a national waste policy which encapsulates the principle of gradual progress towards a zero waste objective. Let nobody think this can be done quickly or overnight or that it can be done by way of regional waste plans, particularly given that they are designed to include incineration and a large landfill component – we know that from the waste plans in place – as if they are a given and it is impossible to contemplate any other option. That has been made impossible by the taking of the reserved function aspect of waste plans from members – the county manager will now consider whether there is any other option. Unfortunately, history has taught us that county managers are not generally the most radical people to consider changes. They are managers and they keep a steady course in whatever direction the Minister points.

He has failed at every turn to do that and not only is he failing but he is congratulating himself on his failure by saying he is coping with a growing problem. It is a growing problem that needs to be reduced. The way to do that is to have a national waste policy which puts an onus on preventing the creation of waste in the first place.

An offer of €50,000 was made to an anti-dump group to withdraw its opposition. For the Minister to countenance the type of behaviour that implies—

All it seeks is the drawing up of a programme or plan. There is nothing wrong with that. Nearly all the regional waste management plans have been adopted. Under this Bill leave will be given to managers to alter them down the line. Instead of having a plan as proposed by Deputy Sargent, managers will have the right to alter adopted waste management plans. They are nearly all adopted as a result of earlier legislation, which allowed the managers to do that. Do all the regional waste management plans adopted include incineration? If that is the reality, I would like the Minister to point that out. The only person who can now alter those is the manager, as nobody else has any authority to alter or amend waste management plans. I ask the Minister to consider what Deputy Sargent is proposing, that there would be an overall plan which would allow members of local authorities which achieve targets set in terms of reduction of refuse, waste and recycling—

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I will address amendment No. 113 in particular, which deals specifically with the issues of dumping and incineration in terms of waste management plans. Its central thrust is that we should avoid having a line of incinerators across the State that will require a constant feed of waste, thus providing no incentive for people to produce less waste. The incineration industry, as I have already outlined, is a dirty one. It is harmful to health and, more importantly, it is totally unnecessary. The Minister knows that communities and councils across the State recognise the futility of incineration and are opposed to it.A recent report demonstrated to the Minister that the worries about the safety of incineration have not been fully addressed. The jury is very much still out on that issue. The report does not even consider the US Environmental Protection Agency's findings in this regard.There is a need for an all-Ireland strategy to deal with waste issues and for a single agency on the island to deal with environmental protection. The Minister is moving ahead of himself considerably by forcing his incineration policy on the people without having first considered the other safe options. It is unfortunate that he intervened continually in the contributions of the preceding two speakers because we would all like an opportunity to deal with the issue at hand more comprehensively.Regarding my amendment and those of Deputy Sargent there is an opportunity for the Minister to realise, at this late stage, that there is no need to poison the people through mismanagement or to be so narrow-minded as to have an environmental protection agency with responsibility for a little more than half of the island and another one with responsibility for the rest. There are waste streams and pollution crossing the Border. I dealt with an incident in this respect in Louth County Council last Saturday morning and I mentioned another incident to the Minister –to which I will return in due course – on the issue of waste pouring across the Border into County Fermanagh. If there was one agency, this issue could be dealt with very comprehensively. Most reluctantly, I will allow other Members to speak because I would have liked to raise many issues. I am extremely disappointed that the Minister could not facilitate us so we could debate this issue to the extent to which it deserves to be debated.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Amendment No. 110 is in my name. I will be brief because extremely little time has been allowed to me. If the group of amendments under discussion were accepted by the Minister it would go some way towards ensuring that the Bill would be worthy of its title – the Protection of the Environment Bill. As it stands, key sections are anti-environment and are nothing short of a method to try bludgeon compliant taxpayers into accepting a bin tax that could rise quickly to €700 per annum, in addition to further taxes such as water charges. This means every family and household could face local taxes of up to €1,000 in a relatively short period. Instead of protecting the environment, the proposal to give the councils power to attempt to leave bins uncollected will destroy it.The Minister failed to answer the points that were put to him on Committee Stage regarding a case in which six local authorities in his part of the country found that 37% of households burn their refuse, thus releasing into the environment, in an uncontrolled fashion, emissions containing dioxins and other dangerous material. The reality is that there are tens of thousands of householders in the greater Dublin area who are opposing the proposal by the Minister to try bludgeon them into accepting a parallel tier of taxation by giving councils the right to refuse to collect their bins. The Fianna Fáil backbenchers should be in the House tonight representing the views of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers in Dublin.

It is also an attack on local democracy because it gives unwarranted powers to the county managers. The Minister may pass this legislation tonight but his troubles are only beginning. He will face outright opposition and the mobilisation of people power in the community if county managers do not collect bins.

The Minister will face massive opposition and democratic people power on the streets.

It is introducing taxation by the back door and will result in unprecedented levels of charges for the collection of refuse. We have estimated these to amount to about €700 per household per year, but this figure could be higher because, to date, we do not know the full implications of section 30 of the Bill. Section 30 states that the operators of waste facilities will be obliged – without discretion – to charge the full economic cost of running those facilities, including the cost of the design, operation, management and subsequent rehabilitation of those sites.On Second Stage, I asked the Minister what these costs would amount to and, to be fair to him, he sent me a note on the matter before Report Stage. However, it only provides us with part of the picture, but it is an interesting part nevertheless. It provides details on loans his Department approved in respect of landfill facilities in 2002: in north Tipperary, almost €4 million was loaned to carry out infrastructural and rehabilitation work at a landfill site; in south Dublin, €10 million was loaned for the Arthurstown site; in Mayo, almost €12 .5 million for the upgrading of two landfill sites; in Clare, €2.5 million; in Waterford, more than €4 million; in Cork, almost €3 million; and Fingal County Council, €20 million. These allocations, totalling more than €50 million, pertain to only seven local authorities. The significance of section 30 is that all this money will have to be recovered.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	475	It is an absolute disgrace that I, as Fine Gael spokesman on environment and local government, must bring to the attention of the nation the absolute failure of this Government to ensure that the young people of this country have the opportunity to put a roof over their heads. It is an absolute disgrace that, in its seventh year of office, and having inherited the best set of economic statistics in history, this Government should have failed so dreadfully on this issue. It is an absolute disgrace that the only Government responses to an escalating crisis in the housing sector have been sympathetic words and an utter lack of action.The Government has presided over the most grotesque rise in the cost of housing ever witnessed. It has sat idly by while a basic necessity became a coveted luxury. It should hang its head in shame. For those seeking to get a foot on the property ladder, the Government has provided a truly appalling vista. House price increases are far in excess of the average salary. In the private sector, under this Government's stewardship, or more correctly, lack of stewardship, the average price for a new home has increased annually at a rate far higher than inflation. New homes cost approximately €0.25 million. For most, paying that price would involve winning the national lottery. Thousands of young people are forced to live with their parents until they are in their thirties, or alternatively in sub-par rented accommodation.There are local authority waiting lists of 52,000 families – not individuals, families – and painfully slow progress in the number of social housing units being completed. The disabled person's grant is at a woefully inadequate level, sentencing those with a disability to a life of sub-standard housing. Most shocking of all, almost 6,000 people are homeless in a wealthy, developed country. That is shameful.One would have thought that the seriousness of this situation would warrant a serious analysis on the part of the Government. One would also have thought the same of those with a professional interest in the property market. Sadly, this has not been the case. Fine Gael holds the Government primarily responsible for the intolerable housing situation we face. However, my party would like to take this opportunity to condemn those who have speculated on the probable bursting of the property bubble.This is not a game; it is a social problem. Housing is a social issue and the predictions of boom and bust do no great service to the housing sector and certainly not to those people who are attempting to get onto the property ladder. It sickens me to see stockbrokers, on the one hand, and auctioneers, on the other, issuing conflicting statements to suit their own agenda. This is a serious issue involving real people. It is not about an investment game or property monopoly or whatever one wants to call it.It gives me no pleasure to detail the litany of Government failures that have led to the housing crisis, but it must be done. One of the more high-profile casualties of the great election swindle of 2002 was the first time buyer's grant. There was no mention of its demise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the Progressive Democrats' manifesto or the programme for Government. Yet with the stroke of Deputy McCreevy's pen, it was gone.In the area of housing for special needs it is ironic that, as we celebrate the holding of the Special Olympics, we seem to forget the hidden Ireland, namely the thousands of people around this country who are being deprived of their basic requirements due to Government indifference and mismanagement. In this year of the disabled, elderly and disabled people are being deprived of essential facilities such as downstairs toilets, stair lifts and showers because of Government cutbacks.The Government boasts about the success of the economy but at the same time is abandoning the old and the sick. In a previous Fine Gael-sponsored debate in this House early this year on the disabled person's grant scheme, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, promised a review of the scheme and other related schemes as well as increased funding, but the only thing that has increased since that promise was made is the queue of people waiting to avail of the scheme.The number of families on local authority waiting lists has risen to at least 52,000 at present, an intolerable situation in a modern economy like ours. Against this awful background, the Taoiseach has some brass neck to suggest that we should wait for possibly another two years for a report on housing matters and land issues. The Taoiseach thinks it is okay for Ireland and the Irish people to wait for eight years of his Government to tackle a crisis that has been emerging steadily since it took office. This is a cynical insult to those putting up with substandard conditions and to those who are dreaming of owning their own home but in reality will never be able to afford it.For the Taoiseach to effectively say that he has no ideas on housing without a constitutional report seems incredible. Under this Government, the shift away from social inclusion towards catering for the property developers is evidenced by the growing numbers of working and middle class people who cannot afford the minimum of €200,000 for a home of their own. The great surge in house prices over the boom years has caused massive upheaval in the housing sector and in Irish society as a whole. The supply of land for houses and houses for people has simply not been sufficient. Proactive action is necessary to bring the balance back into the market. Fine Gael is appalled by the Government's failure to act, but we do not come to this debate empty-handed. The Fine Gael party has suggestions that will go some way to addressing the problem.Fine Gael believes that the implementation of the following steps is the key to meeting the needs of a progressive and just society. We need to consider the creation of a national housing agency which would be set up in four regions and would incorporate a national supervisory and policies board. The agency would liaise with local authorities to ensure efficient planning and development in the housing sector and would also act as a co-ordinating body for the implementation of the National Spatial Strategy. It would anticipate and prevent instability in the housing market and would co-ordinate across different local authority schemes.The Competition Authority should also be asked to investigate the situation of anti-competitive practices in the housing sector.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	479	Hoarding rezoned land has the effect of hindering any type of planned development and needs to be phased out. The perception that developers are keeping prices artificially high should be examined with the option of developing co-operative housing if middle and lower income earners are being deliberately priced out of the market.The increasing cost of housing has come about partly because of the Government's ever-increasing take from home builders and the possibility of greatly increased development contribution charges in response to sections 48 and 49 of the 2000 Act. These increased charges along with the increase in VAT and the abolition of the first-time house buyer's grant pose a real threat to the continued growth in housing supply in order to meet demand. Recent figures published by Permanent TSB show that house prices rose by an average of 1.3% in April and 1% in March. Other factors such as the Government's failure to deal with high insurance costs pose further threats. It is estimated that sharp rises in insurance premiums have added between €3,000 and €4,000 to the price of a new house.For example, it is known that a small family-owned housing contractor paid €10,000 for employers and public liability cover in 2002 and faced a bill of more than €75,000 for the same insurance cover in 2003, which must have a major knock-on effect on the price of housing. The Government should consider the abolition of the 2% insurance levy which would, at least, have a knock-on effect in reducing the rate of increase of house prices.Homelessness is not only but is primarily a housing issue. The Government appears unconcerned that 50,000 people are waiting for council housing and 5,580 are without a home. An integrated addiction and mental health strategy needs to be implemented to first find out exactly what the problems are and then what to do about them. Homeless persons, by their very circumstances, have few support structures around them. Local groups and bodies should be co-ordinated by the local authorities and sufficient funding to deal with homelessness must be a political imperative for the increasingly unaccountable Government.Construction of more student campus accommodation and senior citizen complexes would free up housing stock and ease the strain on the rental sector.Housing is not a comfort, but a necessity. The shame for this Government is that it has not taken seriously the crisis that tarnishes politics as a result. In County Cork in the neighbouring local authority to mine, more than 500 elderly and disabled people are going without essential facilities like downstairs toilets, stair lifts and showers because of Government cutbacks. That is the hidden reality of Ireland where people with disabilities everywhere are being deprived of essential facilities which they need in order to get on with their day-to-day lives. Deputy McGinley has highlighted the same problems in County Donegal, which are replicated throughout the country.In the year of the disabled, the disabled persons grant scheme is collapsing. This appalling situation has come about because of cutbacks in the disabled persons grants, which are administered by local authorities that have been starved of finance this year. In Cork County Council, official figures show that the Government provided slightly more than €6 million this year for the scheme whereas the council actually needs more than €15 million to keep pace with demands. There are approximately 15,000 applications nationally for the disabled persons grant scheme and, despite the fact that demand is increasing and construction inflation is high, the 2003 Estimates show that the budget has been cut by more than €250,000 has been cut from the budget, which is substantial.The national spatial strategy, which has been debated everywhere except in this House, recognises the need for increased housing in the gateways and hubs. Therefore, additional measures are required to ensure the spatial strategy report does not just go on the shelf gathering dust but that the gateways and hubs are allowed to develop as proposed in that plan. The Government must look at the need for investment in physical infrastructure in the gateways and hubs and must look particularly at our transport infrastructure and the proposals for linkages between gateways and hubs allowing them to maximise their potential.The 2002 annual housing statistics report of the Department of the Environment and Local Government showed that the number of new houses and apartments built last year totalled 57,695, an increase of 9% on 2001. However, these statistics alone do not show that in the last few years, 30% of all new residential units in the private sector were bought by investors involved in the rental sector and we must take into consideration that there are approximately 340 houses for every 1,000 people in this country compared with the European average figure of 450 for every 1,000 people.Two other factors must be taken into account when considering future housing demand and supply. The Central Statistics Office's quarterly national household survey showed that the average household size declined from 3.28 in 1991 to 3.04 in 1999 and to 2.97 in 2002 and that the average household size is expected to converge rapidly towards the EU average of 2.63 by 2011 with a significant number of single person households. The number of people in the main household formation age group is expected to rise by 141,000 by 2006, an increase of 27%. Because of these two factors, it is expected that the number of households in Ireland will increase from its current base of 1.25 million to more than 2 million by 2020, which creates an enormous challenge for the implementation of the spatial strategy. If current trends continue, much of this development will take place in the greater Dublin area adding to the congestion of that area as well as driving prices in the greater Dublin area even higher, not to mention the impact on the quality of life in the region.If we are increasing housing output, it must be done in the right locations based on the national spatial strategy in order to achieve a greater balance of regional development, which will bring about an increase in population in different parts of the country rather than creating greater problems in the pressure pot that is Dublin.I am proposing six points that should be debated in order to secure the housing future of the Irish people: the creation of a national housing agency; the easing of barriers to the supply of building land; the creation of an environment where the average young couple can afford a home of their own and start a family of their own which is vital to our society; the creation of a rental sector which will involve rights and responsibilities for both the tenant and the landlord; the greater development of specialised housing groups for homeless people, students, senior citizens and the Travelling Community; and the implementation of the spatial strategy, which is imperative.This issue is too important to be ignored and it is far too important to be left to the Government. I am glad this House has the opportunity to highlight the failure of the Government to act up to now. Let us hope the House can compel it to act in the not too distant future before it is too late.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I compliment my colleague Deputy Allen for affording us this opportunity to highlight the serious problems caused by the Government's lack of housing policy. It is becoming a social problem in every county, including my county. The waiting lists for public authority houses are unprecedented. In County Donegal, there are 2,000 on the list and I understand this figure is more than 50,000 for the entire country. Lack of housing represents a very serious problem.The major housing change made by the Government since taking office more than a year ago was to abolish the first-time house buyer's grant. Those grants were not availed of by millionaires or other wealthy people, but by ordinary people wanting to build an average family home. For that reason I am delighted we have the opportunity of discussing this issue.I wish to focus on the aspect of the motion dealing with disabled persons and essential repairs grants. Yesterday and today, consternation hit County Donegal with regard to these grants. We had almost 600 applications in the county for these excellent and worthy grants. Excellent work has been carried out with their assistance in the past. Today, 600 elderly and disabled people and their parents received letters from Donegal County Council stating baldly, "I am to advise that due to financial constraints, this council have ceased all payments under the grants scheme until further notice". That is a blunt sentence. What hope does it hold out to these people who are depending on such grants?Last night I had a call from a 91 year old lady who was widowed on 17 June. Last year, she and her late husband were approved for an essential repair grant, but due to his medical condition and other circumstances, they decided not to proceed with putting a new roof on the house and replace some doors and windows until a more opportune time. Now she felt it was opportune as she is on her own. She invited the builders who kindly consented to start work next Monday. However, yesterday that lady, who has been waiting to repair her house over the last year, got a letter stating she is not to proceed with the job because all grant payments have ceased until further notice.What about those people who have already carried out work on their houses? I received a letter by fax from another old age pensioner who has had two hip replacements. He and his wife received the grant last year, began the repair work and will be finished this weekend. They now have been told that the builder, who is owed €16,000 to €17,000, has to wait for his money. I am not talking about millionaire builders that figured in tribunals. I am talking about ordinary handymen with a C2 certificate and one or two employees who specialise in these kind of jobs.

What are the small builders to do now? They might be owed €5,000, €10,000, or €15,000. Where is the money going to come from? Are they to go out of business? This is what is happening due to the cutbacks in these grants.Half an hour ago I received a copy of a letter from an individual who informed me that his 95 year old grandmother had her essential repairs grant job carried out. The inspector from the council saw everything was in order and payment was due. However, she received a letter yesterday stating there is no money for the 95 year old granny in County Donegal. Where is the morality there?Highland Radio was inundated with calls from all over the county this morning from people who had similar stories to tell. In this year of the disabled, as Deputy Allen said, we are treating our elderly and disabled in such a despicable manner. I was informed of another case from a mother whose nine year old child is suffering from cerebral palsy. Everything must be done for them in terms of care. As the mother wishes her child to be looked after at home, she applied for a grant to widen the doors for the wheelchair and a hoist to assist the child in and out of bed. Now, the mother has received a similar letter stating that there is no money available for this kind of essential repair.I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is in the Chamber because he will remember that a fortnight ago a deputation came from Donegal County Council appraising him that there are 570 applications in the county for these grants. Some of the jobs have been completed and some have been started. Of the €3.9 million we got this year, €3.4 million is for work that was completed last year. I ask the Minister of State and the Government to have another look at the area of disabled persons grants and essential repairs grants. The Government should look after the grandmothers, the widows and the elderly in County Donegal.

I question how any Member could not join in doing so given the crisis that exists in housing. Then again, there are few Members opposite in the Chamber and I presume they are running scared on this issue.Only yesterday we were treated to the latest set of statistics from the Central Bank and the ESRI. It is further evidence of the Government's shameful inaction. The Central Bank announced that mortgage lending continues to grow despite widespread concern. In May alone, mortgage lending increased by 23.6%. Private sector credit is up by 16%. The average price of a house has risen by over 14% in the year up to May. Forecasts for growth in house prices have been revised upwards yet again.This Government has idled while the average price paid by first-time buyers has risen to from €100,000 to €192,000. That is the amount this Government is prepared to let young couples shell out for their first home. In County Clare, the housing statistical bulletin shows the average price of a second-hand house at an amazing €201,566. To make matters worse, the Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant and increased the lower VAT rate by 1%. This automatically increased the cost of every home for already overburdened families.Not only are people having to borrow more to put a roof over their heads but, as a consequence, they have less money to save to prepare them for whatever further cuts this Government has planned. The Central Bank has announced that the amount of money being paid into the SSIA scheme fell by 11% in May compared to the previous month. While affordability and savings are everyday pressing issues for families, this Government is failing to react appropriately. Despite over 50,000 families remaining on the waiting list for housing, less than 4,500 local authority houses were completed last year. In County Clare, overall housing output fell from 1,652 in 2000 to 1,466 last year. The trend is remarkably going the wrong way.When is the Minister of State going to wake up to the financial reality of so many young families today? When is he going to take decisive and meaningful action? I mean action because promise after promise by this Government on housing has been broken. They have failed to deliver to accelerate the supply of new houses, to control the rise in house prices and to adequately expand social housing programmes. Comparing the Government's promises and actions on housing must make the Minister of State utterly ashamed.The Government has basked in the reflected glory of those admirable athletes, coaches and volunteers who have been an example to so many of us in the recent Special Olympics. At the same time, the waiting lists for disabled person's increase. The Government has changed the eligibility criteria for these grants so that they are now more difficult to obtain. Why does it not set the level of these grants at an amount that might realistically cover the costs involved?In its estimates last year, Clare County Council allocated €584,200 under the disabled grants scheme. Due to the skyrocketing costs presided over by the Government, and with nearly 300 applicants, that money fell far short of what was required.This House has widely welcomed and endorsed this year as the European Year of People with Disabilities, yet Members on the Government side – of whom there are very few here tonight – are executing cutbacks that deprive the disabled and the elderly of essential services, such as a downstairs toilet, shower or a stair lift. Deputy McGinley outlined many such cases and I have further examples of constituents who are experiencing similar difficulties. The Disability Federation of Ireland claims that people with disabilities are trapped in potentially dangerous homes, due to the failure of the disabled person's grant scheme. This is nothing short of a disgrace.I conclude by urging the Government to act in a most uncharacteristic manner; I ask it to implement the necessary and fitting measures to address the crisis that seems obvious to all but the Government itself. I call on the Government to do the right thing and change the policy that neglects and hinders the young and the vulnerable in their quest for the most basis of all rights, a decent and affordable home.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	486	It is timely that we should have a discussion on housing in the Dáil before the summer recess. I thank Deputy Allen for affording us this opportunity to look at some of the problems that exist in this regard.A recent survey in The Economist ranked Ireland as the third most expensive country after Japan and the Netherlands in which to buy a house. Dublin is the seventh most costly capital for a city centre two-bedroom flat after London, New York, Tokyo, Milan, Paris and Sydney.The Bank of Ireland's recent Irish Property Review showed that house prices in 2002 increased by 14%, with gains in Dublin slightly higher at an estimated 16.5%. The review forecasts that 62,000 houses will be built this year with the average price of a new home costing €207,000 nationally and €267,000 in Dublin. As Deputy Allen pointed out, some 30% of houses were bought by private investors rather than families.The report also examined the Irish demographic situation. A sizeable youth population is still working its way through the market and this is expected to underpin future demand. It is estimated that up to 55,000 new homes a year could be required between now and 2006, and 50,000 per annum between then and 2011 due to the young population. Some 1.3 million people in Ireland are aged between 15 and 34 years of age. That fact, coupled with immigration, could make the demand even higher.In today's Evening Herald, I noticed an article which stated that despite the economic slowdown, house prices are growing by some €500 per week. Overall, we are now one of the most expensive countries in the world. It is becoming impossible for many young people to buy their own home and this will become a more serious problem in the future. The one thing saving Ireland at the moment – and saving our heavily borrowed population – is the fact that we are governed by European interest rates. But for that, there would be a major crisis.There are currently 52,000 people on the local authority waiting list. More than 2,500 of that number are in Kerry which is a major problem. In the 1980s, we almost had to look for people to take houses in Listowel but now there is a waiting list in the region of 260 people. In many cases, people are looking for transfers from two-bedroom or three-bedroom houses as their family units have increased in size. I understand there are just 11 houses available for allocation in the next few months, which is indicative of the crisis that exists.I urge the Minister to review the local authority shared ownership scheme, which is no longer any use to many people as houses are too expensive. While it was a most effective scheme it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to buy houses for the amount of money that is available under the scheme. As recently as today, somebody raised this matter with me.I will now hand over to Deputy Neville. There is a crisis at the moment that needs to be tackled. I have no doubt that some good suggestions will emanate from this debate and I commend the motion to the House.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and congratulate Deputy Allen for introducing the motion.I wish to focus on the issue of special housing aid for the elderly, a scheme operated by the health boards under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This is one of the most frustrating schemes currently in operation and is practically useless to the people who need it. In my constituency, only those who are on an emergency list will get any work done under this scheme. That is what we are told in the letters we receive on behalf of concerned constituents. I am aware of someone who applied five years ago and is now on priority list two. It appears that the work will not be done this year. It will take some nine to 12 months for work to be completed for those on priority list one. Nobody on the second list can hope to have any work done this year. What are those on the third list told? It may be unfair to tell them that the required work will be done because many of them will have moved on to the next world by the time anything is done. A scheme that operates in this way is a mockery.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	489	Such a scheme should be closely examined. It falsely raises the hopes of the elderly who feel that the scheme is there for them. The scheme was designed to provide showers for people who cannot use a bath any longer due to their infirmity and for those who can no longer climb a stairs and, consequently, need a downstairs toilet. These much needed changes, however, are not being made under the special housing aid for the elderly scheme.Today, I met representatives of the Disability Federation of Ireland in Buswell's Hotel. They raised strong concerns about the disabled person's grant and the changes in many counties where prioritisation and controls are currently being introduced. It appears to be going the same route as the special housing aid for the elderly scheme. The federation is extremely concerned. I have a great deal of information from them but I do not have time to go into it in detail.I urge the Minister to look at both of these schemes. We do not need two schemes. They should be amalgamated and a properly designed scheme should be introduced in their place. People should know what to expect and the rules should not be changed in mid-stream, as Deputy McGinley outlined in great detail. This is unfair to elderly people who have worked all their life and paid their taxes. The rules of such schemes, which are designed to give them decent housing conditions in their old age and infirmity are being changed every year. The schemes are no good to them.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:– "acknowledges the achievements of the Government in:– focusing on increasing housing supply as the key response to the broad range of housing needs and demand;– supporting record levels of housing output in each year since 1997 culminating in the completion of 57,695 units in 2002;– expanding the local authority housing programme to the highest level of output for 16 years;– increasing voluntary housing output in 2002 to the highest levels ever achieved in this country;– focusing on the delivery of affordable housing;– introducing and resourcing an integrated strategy on homelessness; and– focusing housing expenditure on responding to the needs of low income households and those with special needs through a broad range of targeted initiatives; and– supports the continued action and commitment by the Government, as set out in the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement, to the delivery of an ambitious scale of affordable housing and to reviewing the effectiveness of programmes designed to assist low income groups, including those with social housing and special housing needs."I am pleased to open the Government response to another ill-conceived Fine Gael motion and to set out, once again, the main elements of the Government's approach to housing as well as to update the house on the positive effects of this approach. Housing remains at the top of the Government's agenda. We have taken a wide range of measures during our two terms in office to reduce house price inflation, increase housing output to match demand, remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development, afford greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers and improve affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households. We have a proud record of achievement in delivering housing across the broad spectrum of housing needs. Since 1997 our efforts have brought a substantial rise in output, with a consequent moderation in the increase in house prices. Some 57,695 new houses were completed last year, which was the eighth year of record production in a row. To put that in perspective, one has only to look at the fact that 21,000, 22,000 and 23,000 houses were built in the early 1990s, which is only ten or 11 years ago. That is a huge increase in output in ten years.

The key response of Government is supply. In ten years supply has increased from 21,000 houses per year to 57,000 and it looks like that figure will hit 60,000 this year.However, the context in which housing policy operates has changed dramatically in the recent past. The unprecedented demand for housing brought about by a number of economic and demographic changes, such as rising disposable incomes, historically low interest rates and changing household formation patterns, has placed pressure on housing supply and house prices. This demand has remained strong notwithstanding the recent slowing of economic growth and it seems likely that the demographic changes underpinning this demand are set to continue. Recently published data from the Central Statistics Office population survey last year points to the decline in the size of families. Coupled with population growth and inward migration, this decline in household size is increasing the demand for housing.The national development plan estimated the total demand for housing required an additional 500,000 houses to be built in the ten years to 2010. Population forecasts underpinning the national spatial strategy generally confirm this position. This Government is firmly committed to the continuation of the measures which we initiated in our previous term to increase the supply of housing. These measures included increasing investment in the provision of serviced land for housing and more effective use of that land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities.

We are also examining issues around the cost of land required for development and affordable housing in particular. The Taoiseach has asked the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution to assess the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land, having regard to the constitutional and practical issues involved.

In addition, my Department is looking at identifying other necessary measures aimed at moderating land costs for housing and other essential public infrastructure.Our success in increasing housing supply is reflected in the eighth consecutive year of record house completions achieved last year. We are building houses at a faster rate compared to our European counterparts.

The Deputy mentioned the development of an expanded rental sector. If a house is bought by me or by the Deputy and is let to someone, it still provides a unit of accommodation.Last year 14.7 new dwellings per 1,000 population were completed compared to the UK building rate of approximately three units per 1,000 population. I was at a conference recently where I saw the relevant figures for our EU partners. They were extraordinary because we were streets ahead. Sweden had a building rate of one dwelling per 1,000 population, while the UK's rate was three. No other country was near us in terms of house completions. Perhaps we have come from a small base, but 14.7 new dwellings per 1,000 population is enormous. It is a tribute to the Government and to those in the construction industry that we have managed to achieve that level of output in recent years. Even with housing output at record levels, which were not seen before in this country and are unique in European terms in relation to population, we are still faced with difficulties in meeting the ever growing demand for housing. Nevertheless, the overall objective of the Government is to ensure that output responds to the projected housing demand.I was pleased that the supply of housing in Dublin increased significantly in 2002.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	505	As well as prices.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Our figures were high for a few years, but the greater Dublin area was not expanding to the same extent. Last year there was a growth of 31% over 2001 levels and the early indications are that output is continuing to grow in 2003. Provisional figures for the first quarter will show that housing output in Dublin has increased by 16% or 17%. They are the type of figures we need. If we could do that for a couple of years, we should be able to meet demand. We are seeing the benefits of investment in serviced land and the effective use of these lands through residential density guidelines. The industry has also responded to the Government's call with a greater range of starter homes now coming on stream.I and the Government are aware of the role of home ownership in contributing to the needs of people. I feel strongly about maintaining and promoting that. The affordability of the housing we provide must improve in line with increasing supply and our policy is focused on that. I am acutely aware of the need to get as many people as possible onto the first rung of the housing ladder and that is why I have placed great emphasis on the delivery of affordable housing.Activity under the affordable and shared ownership schemes, which are aimed at low income households, continues to increase. A total of almost 1,700 houses were sold under the shared ownership scheme last year, an increase of 4.6% on the previous year. I expect a similar level of activity this year. I accept what Deputy Deenihan said about the need to increase the levels. However, one must be careful because the last time we increased the figures approvals were given to people for €150,000 when they previously got approvals for €130,000. Estate agents then wanted to know for what they had approval and the house which was €119,000 last week was suddenly increased to €139,000. While we all understand the point made by Deputy Deenihan, we sometimes get caught up in trying to meet the needs of individuals. However, we must be careful to ensure that policy does not give estate agents the excuse to increase house prices.The affordable housing scheme accounted for the needs of almost 900 households last year, which was a threefold increase on the number of households provided for in 2001. This year, approximately 1,000 houses will be sold under the scheme. Our target of 2,000 units for both of these schemes – the shared ownership scheme and the affordable housing scheme—

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The Deputy might end up calling in his own colleagues.Our target of 2,000 units for both of these schemes was comfortably exceeded last year and activity should be further enhanced this year. The provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will also assist in the delivery of social and affordable housing. The changes made to the 2000 Act, which provide for greater flexibility in concluding agreements between planning authorities and developers, will ensure a more efficient operation of Part V. I understand many authorities are actively engaged with developers in Part V pre-planning discussions and negotiations and I look forward to the contribution to overall output from this measure.The important contribution that affordable housing provision can make in helping those in younger and lower income households to achieve their dreams of owning their own homes has been recognised in the new national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. The new affordable housing initiative being developed is aimed at further enhancing the supply of affordable housing. I welcome this initiative as another means of bringing more affordable housing on stream. The Government is committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing for the target groups concerned. This initiative will differ from the local authority affordable housing scheme in terms of the target group and the fact that it will be designed not to have an impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances. Furthermore, it is intended that the initiative will not detract from the funding available for existing social and affordable housing programmes or affect the momentum of delivery of these programmes. We will work to ensure that the output from all affordable housing schemes is maximised.It is important that those on various rungs on the housing market ladder are offered real choices, including choices in respect of tenure. Meeting increased housing demands in a balanced and efficient fashion requires not only increased private housing supply but also provision for tenure choice. For that reason, the Government is committed to developing and modernising the private rented sector in order that the range of effective choices can be expanded. I was glad to hear Deputy Allen speak about the rental sector as one of his key areas. The Residential Tenancies Bill was published on 30 May 2003 and commenced Second Stage in the Dáil a few weeks ago. Subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, it should be enacted towards the end of the year, even if Second Stage has not been completed before the summer recess.The Bill provides for the legislative reform of the private rented sector recommended by the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector and accepted by the Government. It introduces a significant measure of security of tenure for tenants, specifies minimum obligations applying to landlords and tenants and provides for the establishment of a private residential tenancies board to resolve disputes arising in the sector, operate a system of tenancy registration and provide information and policy advice. Furthermore, the Bill restricts rents to market level and also contains provisions relating to procedures for the termination of tenancies, including graduated notice periods linked to the duration of a tenancy. The private residential tenancies board will be established when the relevant provisions of the Residential Tenancies Bill come into operation. The Government recognises that the private rented sector has an important role in meeting housing needs and the introduction of this Bill demonstrates our commitment to providing a new residential landlord and tenant regime.This Government can also claim credit for bringing about real and positive change in the provision of social and affordable housing. We have responded actively to the increased level of housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output very significantly. Last year saw the delivery of the highest level of output under the range of social and affordable housing measures for more than 15 years, with the social and affordable housing needs of more than 12,700 households being met.In overall terms, the total capital funding for housing in 2003, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, is just over €1.7 billion, an increase of almost 7% on the amount provided in 2002. This will provide for the social and affordable housing needs of close to 13,000 households. This is in addition to the substantial increases that were provided in 2002 and 2001 – 19% and 52%. The equivalent capital provision in 1997 – only six years ago – was €442 million, or only one quarter of what is being provided for this year. Looking at the development of the resources over that period, one can see the enormous amount invested. In effect, we are consolidating the very significant progress made in recent years and maintaining a very high level of commitment to social and affordable housing. The overall figure for this year has gone up by 7% but at that level, even if things stand still for a year or two, we are maintaining progress.In its action programme, the Government set out its key housing priorities, including a continuing house construction programme for local authorities and voluntary groups, refurbishment of existing inadequate housing and the improvement and extension of social housing schemes. Since the Government took office it has made remarkable progress in widening and strengthening social housing measures. The Government has been very conscious of the increased level of social housing need. The motion tabled by the Opposition indicated that there were 52,000 families on local authority waiting lists while only 4,400 houses were completed last year. I do not know where the Opposition found these figures.

Last year, the needs of more than 12,700 households were met through social housing provision. That means that more than 12,700 families on waiting lists obtained proper housing last year. Local authorities themselves built or acquired 5,074 housing units. The figure quoted by the Opposition overlooks the full range of responses to meeting the needs of local authorities. Specifically, it seems to ignore the fact that local authorities bought almost 700 second-hand houses.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	534	Through the capital assistance and loan subsidy scheme, voluntary bodies provided a further 1,360 houses to families on waiting lists. The motion fails to acknowledge the valuable contribution many such voluntary bodies make to the provision of social housing. The Government recognises the important role of voluntary bodies and will continue to support their valuable work.I mentioned the 12,700 households whose needs were met last year through the provision of social housing but we must also include the work done by voluntary bodies through the shared ownership, mortgage allowance and affordable housing schemes. All of those make a contribution with the result that some 12,700 families on the waiting list accepted offers of accommodation. I am not suggesting that the list has decreased by that number because I realise that new people are applying all the time. This year, however, local authorities alone will secure the completion of some 5,000 housing units, which is an indication of how they have successfully accelerated their programmes in order to meet existing demand.I expect that the needs of close to 13,000 households on waiting lists will be met this year. In 1997, capital expenditure on the main local authority housing programme was €229 million and this year it will be €700 million. In the past five years, we have invested €2.66 billion in that programme alone, which is proof positive of strong Government support for the provision of local authority housing.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	536	Each household on the waiting list comprises individuals with their own set of needs. It is quite wrong for the Opposition or anyone else to group them in a way that ignores the variety and range of the different needs of single people and families in a variety of existing accommodation. We are also witnessing the emergence of new pressures on the waiting lists arising from refugees from non-EU countries as well as asylum seekers who have been given permission to remain in this country as a result of having Irish-born children. The extra numbers on the waiting lists are reflected in local authorities such as Fingal and South County Dublin where up to 18% or 19% of those on waiting lists are from the aforementioned categories that were not on the waiting lists some years ago. Approximately 32% of those on waiting lists are single people who require a different type of accommodation. Comparing current waiting lists with those which existed five or ten years ago is not comparing like with like. I am not denying that the numbers on the lists are too high, but the measures we are taking will hopefully continue to reduce them.Some local authorities, including Fingal, have changed their letting schemes in order that houses can be allocated on the basis of a person's length of time in the scheme. Officials in the housing department of Fingal County Council have made three or four offers to people who have been on the waiting list for five or ten years. If such people do not accept the offers it raises questions and one begins to wonder if people are really in urgent need of accommodation. As a public representative, I have often encouraged people to get on the waiting list just in case their ideal house came up. It is extraordinary, however, that local authority officials have told me that they have made three or four offers to some people who did not accept them. I am sure Deputy Seán Ryan has met these people himself.

These include Oliver Bond flats, Nicholas Street-Ross Road, Liberty House and Mary Aikenhead House, as well as work in Cork and Limerick. Major regeneration schemes are also ongoing, such as the redevelopment of Ballymun where we will be providing about 2,900 new low-rise houses over the next six years. This year alone we expect to see the completion of about 400 new houses there. Regeneration work is continuing on inner-city blocks, including the Glen area in Cork city involving the construction of 48 new housing units and the refurbishment of 24 existing flats at a cost of €18 million.A key concern for me, as Minister of State, has been to meet the special needs of particular categories of householders, such as the elderly and the disabled. This concern, which was mentioned earlier by some Deputies, is reflected in the funding that has been made available for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly, the disabled person's grant scheme, the essential repairs grant scheme and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing. I heard what Members said earlier but, last year, the total number of grants paid by local authorities under the disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant schemes was 9,200 at a value of some €84 million. In 2001, there were 6,300 grants. The improvements the Government has made to the terms and conditions of both schemes since taking office, have led to a significant increase in activity, given that fewer than 3,000 grants were paid in 1996.Earlier in the debate, Deputy McGinley spoke about Donegal, but some counties—

If one examines the list of such grant usage in different counties, the differences are extraordinary.

That is not sustainable. Many local authorities are whingeing and crying but they have not made provision for one third of the money themselves. Some counties may have gone the other way around, including Deputy McGinley's. They should be careful that the money they are borrowing to pay their own one third is sustainable, otherwise they may be putting a millstone around the neck of their local authority for the future. The scheme needs to be reviewed and we are doing this. Various counties are introducing changes but we would like counties to be more measured in their approach. They should not just keep going until the kitty is empty and then send out letters to say they cannot meet expenditure costs.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I wish to share time with Deputies Seán Ryan and Perry. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal has addressed housing issues on a number of occasions and replied to parliamentary questions on the topic but the more I hear him, the more I arrive at the conclusion that at the very least he is out of touch and is certainly out of sympathy for those in need of housing.I refer to the beginning of the Minister of State's contribution and what he trumpets as the Government's objectives in the area of housing. He boasted, "We have taken a wide range of measures over the course of our two terms in office to reduce house price inflation."  I do not know whether he has noticed that house prices have increased by 130% during that period, which is five times the rate of inflation, four times the rate of increase in average industrial earnings and more than three times the rate of increase in building costs. Earlier this week a Permanent TSB-ESRI study highlighted that house prices increased by 14% in the past year, which is three times the rate of inflation, yet the Minister of State thinks the Government has done something to reduce house price inflation.He stated a Government objective "to increase housing output to match demand."  The Government parties in their two terms have presided over a doubling of the number of people on local authority housing waiting lists. Will the Minister of State or his economic advisers explain how supply can increase but house prices continue to soar?The next Government objective is "to remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential developments."  The Government presides over traffic chaos and congestion throughout the State and cannot get its act together to put essential public infrastructure in place, for example, in Dublin city where it wants to run an over-ground rail system through the busiest road junction in the country.A further objective is "to afford greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers". However, it abolished the first-time buyer's grant and contributed to inflated house prices by increasing VAT on building materials by 1%, which has added €6,000 to the price of an average house. The Government may fuel prices further by presiding over the increases in development charges that are being contemplated by local authorities.The Minister of State stated the Government's intention "to improve affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households", yet those on low and modest incomes have been priced out of the market by the Government. The Minister of State is under the impression that if one is single and is on a housing list, one's need for housing is not that great and it is not something about which we should be concerned. It ought to be easier to house single people than to house those with family needs. If one third of the housing lists comprises single people, it is all the greater shame on the Minister of State and the Government for their failure to meet their needs. The Minister of State's attitude is that people on housing lists do not have a housing need because they are single or refusing houses. Any old excuse will be used not to provide housing for them.However, the most disgraceful comment in the Minister of State's contribution related to the disabled person's grant when he implied that people applying for this grant are faking their disabilities. That is a disgraceful comment, which should be withdrawn. It is shameful that applications for the grant by people with disabilities who have a housing need, particularly elderly people who cannot climb stairs and live in difficult circumstances, are being turned down, not processed or delayed for two to three years.The Minister of State will have a few months to reflect on this issue before the House resumes. He would be better off applying himself to persuading the Government to give him the resources to address the State's housing need than coming to the House to offer excuses, for example, for people not receiving the disabled person's grant or the lengthening housing waiting lists.The Government likes to boast. The Taoiseach and his Ministers have claimed credit for every job created and every economic advance made over the past six years. They even, unashamedly, claim credit for initiatives, with which they had absolutely nothing to do, such as the Taoiseach's tawdry airborne attempt last weekend to hijack credit for the Special Olympics. However, they are undeniably silent on the housing issue. Since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats took office in 1997, the average price of a new house has increased by 130%, which is five times the rate of inflation, four times the rate of increase in average industrial earnings and more than three times the rate of increase in building costs. The Government has ended for young working families on low and modest incomes the prospect of buying their own homes or at least the possibility of buying a home in their own communities or near their places of work.Having failed to make house purchase affordable, the Government has also failed to protect the interest of tenants in the private rented sector. During the six years these parties have been in power, more families have lost their homes through eviction than during an equivalent period of the 19th century under British rule. A Sunday newspaper published a photograph of an eviction scene from the 19th century, which is part of the Lawrence collection and it caused me to ask a question, which the Fourth Estate might answer. Photographs of 19th century evictions are available but we do not have photographs or video or other evidence, which it ought to be possible to put together, of the many families who have been evicted from flats, apartments and houses during the past six years.The Bill to provide minimum protection for tenants was delayed for three years and has been postponed again until after the summer recess, which will give the unscrupulous minority of bad landlords an additional opportunity to evict tenants and increase rents before the Bill's provisions come into operation.

Despite the doubling of the numbers on housing lists since 1997, the Government parties have cut the budget for social housing this year by 5% in monetary terms and 20% in terms of housing output. In an era in which Ireland has enjoyed its greatest economic prosperity, it is shameful that the Government has failed the people regarding housing provision. No Government in the history of the State, no matter what its composition or political complexion, and many having had to operate in difficult economic circumstances, has failed like this one in terms of housing. It has failed to provide housing for those who cannot afford to buy a house and has especially failed the 5,500 people in this country, including more than 1,000 children in this city, who are homeless tonight as we speak.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution on the Fine Gael motion on housing. As this is not the first motion from various parties on the issue, I hope the Minister will take on board the concerns and views of the Opposition.The removal of the €3,810 first time buyer's grant and the increase in VAT to 13.5% on new houses in the December budget impacted significantly on house buyers, particularly first time buyers in the affordable housing category. Figures released yesterday show that the average price of a new house nationally is €198,000 and in the greater Dublin area a whopping €256,000. Prior to the last general election people, particularly young people, were led to believe by Minister after Minister that the full implementation of the Bacon report would resolve the problem of supply, with a consequential reduction in the price of houses. Three years later, first time buyers must pay €250,000 for a house, with prices continuing to spiral out of control.The original intention of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was to encourage integration, that is, movement away from the concept of large public housing estates, which were a blight on areas. The recent changes in Part V of the Act have thrown out the window the concept of integration. The changes give developers the option to build and ignore the requirements under the planning Acts. If a developer has another suitable site, he can relocate the social and affordable housing element of his development. It is obvious that the Minister has given in once again to pressure from developers. The consequences of the cave-in will be large-scale social housing developments in certain locations in the future. Unfortunately, some of us, particularly the Government, will not learn from the mistakes of the past.Affordable housing throughout the country, particularly in the greater Dublin area, has not made the progress envisaged. The maximum loan that may be advanced to an eligible applicant by a local authority is €130,000. The eligibility on income grounds is €32,000, or a formula of up to €80,000 where there is more than one applicant. It is totally unacceptable that income limits have not been changed since 15 June 2000. It is imperative that the maximum loan is increased and income limits are set at a more realistic level.In the brief time available to me I want to refer to an issue I raised previously. It relates to the potential of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. As we speak here tonight, many suitably qualified applicants have been deprived affordable housing under Part V of legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and signed by the President, due to an impasse between the financial institutions and the Minister. Under the scheme, it was envisaged that the finance for the scheme would be provided by the financial institutions. However, these institutions are not prepared to implement the claw-back arrangements inherent in the scheme. People who exceed the €32,000 limit for a €130,000 loan are being told by the building institutions that they cannot obtain a loan, while at the same time they are being told by local authorities that they have exceeded the limit of €32,000. No one seems to be taking on board the provision under Part V of the 2000 Act. I ask the Minister of State to take the gloves off to the financial institutions to resolve this issue. He must also ensure that local authorities implement this scheme.

Housing is one of the most important issues facing this generation.Where is the Government's hired gun, Peter Bacon, who has gone from the frying pan into the fire? He was wheeled out on every issue to justify the previous Government's building programme. However, he is not being wheeled out by the current Administration. It is difficult to justify that Sligo County Council only received approval for its expenditure in June of this year when it should have been approved in January. Therefore, it must spend its whole allocation in six months. Four developments in the area, including Tubbercurry, Coolaney, Bunanadden and Grange, are waiting for local authority approval. The council must spend its whole allocation in six months and if the money is not spent it will be deducted from the next allocation, which is very unfair.

Re-design is just one of the reasons given to justify non-compliance. As Deputy Gilmore said, house prices have increased by 135%. In Sligo alone, only 755 housing units were built in 2002 compared to 903 in 1998. House prices are 25% more expensive than they are in America. There are 52,000 people on the national housing waiting list. More than 800 families are on the housing list in Sligo.

That is an elitist market. Some 800 people are waiting for a house in Sligo. The first time buyer's grant was abolished in the last budget. Even though the purpose of this abolition was to reduce house prices, prices have increased. The 1% increase in VAT has added €2,000 to the price of a house. There was also an increase in PRSI.Five years ago, five out of ten houses cost less than €120,000. Now just one out of ten can be bought for less than €120,000. Some 4,000 houses were promised last year in the voluntary housing sector but only 1,360 houses were built.

I do not know who is erecting them but it is a big con job. Every job being carried out is referred to as an NDP job. All the national development plan means to Sligo is NDP signs. It is the biggest joke of all time. To own one's home was deemed essential in the past, but now it is a luxury. It took the Government six years to introduce the Bill on the rental sector which is not yet enacted.Deputy Gilmore's comments about the essential repairs grant were correct. Reference was made to fact that managers were spending their allocation of money. They are only getting peanuts. They must match that fund from their own allocation. The Government cannot even accommodate people in nursing homes. People are being sent home. An 81 year old lady who has neither heating nor hot water in her house called to my office yesterday. She was told the fund has almost run out and that she will have to join the queue to establish if she is entitled to an essential grant for the elderly.The Minister of State referred to a caring Government but under this Government the most vulnerable in society are not cared for. There are 800 people waiting for houses in Sligo and the Minister of State told me they should go into the elitist, rental market. I am disappointed with his reply.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	567	What is being done here tonight is typical of what the Government does with potentially controversial legislation. It runs the legislation through at high speed in the last few days before a Dáil recess, usually with a guillotine so that most of the issues cannot be debated or aired, sparing Government Deputies the embarrassment of having to vote on specific contentious issues.There should be no mistake about this Bill, which is going to haunt the Government and the Deputies who support it in the vote at 9.30 p.m. tonight. In the course of the next 18 months, when the average householder gets a bill of maybe €700 for refuse collection, this is the Bill that gives county managers the power to set that charge. Next December and January, when local authorities consider their estimates, county managers will go into those meetings and tell the elected members that this is the charge they are imposing. Councillors and the wider community can object but this is the Bill which gives county managers the power to do that. I invite the Minister to tell us when these measures will commence. Sometime in the next two years individual householders may find their bins uncollected if they have not paid their charges – or they may find their neighbours have not paid the charges and their bins are not collected, to the detriment of the environment and health of the neighbourhood. This is the Bill which gives local authorities the power to act in that way.When a community has difficulties with a proposal such as the decision to locate an incinerator or landfill in its neighbourhood, it may ask Government Deputies at some public meeting who made the decision. Those Deputies will say the county manager made the decision but let there be no mistake that the decision is being made tonight. This is the Bill which gives county managers the power to make waste management plans and to determine where to put incinerators or superdumps and to include them in the waste management plans without being second guessed.As I indicated earlier, two Government amendments make this Bill even more unacceptable than it was on Committee Stage. In effect a new Bill has been tacked on to the legislation which deals with end-of-life vehicles. We should remind people of what they are heading into as a result, though in the next year or two the penny will drop for many people in the motor trade, particularly those in the second hand motor trade. Lest the Minister make accusations, I am broadly in favour of implementing the EU directive on end-of-life vehicles but I would like some opportunity to tease it out and debate it properly. There are many people working in the motor trade in every constituency and when the penny drops regarding the provisions of the Bill they are in for a shock and a rude awakening. When those people approach Government Deputies those Deputies should not say they did not know what was going on. Those Deputies will come in tonight at 9.30 p.m. and vote for measures which will provoke hard questions from workers in the motor trade over the next 18 months.However, my biggest concern is with amendment No. 112. This is the most significant change in Irish planning law in living memory. Precedence is being given to waste management plans made by county managers over the development plans made by elected members of local authorities.

This is a new amendment, the effect of which is to empower the county manager to decide where an incinerator may go and what will be in the waste management plan. That plan will be adopted lock, stock and barrel, which is bad enough, but the county manager's waste management plan will take precedence over the county development plan. If, for example, a county manager decides to put a dump or incinerator in an area of high amenity, under this legislation nobody can challenge that on the grounds that it contravenes the county development plan because the waste management plan takes precedence. Not only that, but the person who makes the waste management plan in the first place is the very officer who will ultimately make the planning decision as to whether those developments go ahead.This is standing down local democracy. It takes rights away from elected members that they have always had and gives those rights to unelected officials with a statutory authority and power of law that is unprecedented. This is a very bad evening for democracy in this country.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I protest strongly at the way the Opposition is being treated regarding this Bill. I got a call yesterday to the effect that the Minister was introducing amendments and I asked for them to be sent to me in Cork. When I received them I could not believe what I was reading. We had ten pages of amendments on Report Stage after discussing the Bill for many hours on Committee Stage. The Minister can come in with a troop of advisers and support staff but Opposition spokespersons are expected to assess the merits and demerits of those amendments. Consultation was out of the question.What we have is a jackboot Government introducing controversial legislation in the dying days of this session. In the last session, the controversial sections of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill were pushed through against the wishes of the Opposition. This Bill, which has been described by many as a Trojan horse, is supposed to be a Protection of the Environment Bill but under that guise, it proposes the most fundamental undermining of local democracy I have experienced. Last night I spoke at a convention in Cork to select somebody to succeed me as I will have to surrender my council seat under the dual mandate rule. I said I was getting out at a sad time for local democracy because the councillor position has been totally undermined by the proposals in this legislation. The manager will raise and impose the charges. As we said, Fianna Fáil councillors will be able to wash their hands, do a Pontius Pilate act and say, "It is not us, it is the manager."  Amendment No. 112 overrides—

As I said, the role of the councillor is now meaningless. The manager has the supreme power and Fianna Fáil councillors can do a Pontius Pilate act and say, "It is not us, it is the manager". We face the local election campaign in the coming months but many people will not vote because they will see the writing on the wall for local authorities. This Government, which set out with pious platitudes about reform of local government, did many U-turns in its first couple of months in office and is now sounding the death knell of local democracy. People of calibre will be reluctant to run for office because they will see the role of the councillor as meaningless. I object strenuously to the arrogant way this Government has tabled fundamental and important amendments. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, I cannot discuss them and, therefore, they will go through without discussion and that is bad for democracy.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I listened carefully to what Deputies opposite had to say and I will try to deal with their comments in order. First, I will deal with the amendments before us. The purpose of amendments Nos. 109 and 110 is to reserve the proposal to transfer the power to review and replace the waste management plan from the elected members of local authorities to the manager. This aspect of the Bill was the subject of much discussion in the Seanad and during Second and Committee Stages in this House. It is important to bear in mind that the waste management planning process was only brought to a conclusion after many years by the introduction, as a last resort, of legislation which made the making of a plan an executive function. This was necessary not only in order that we could move on to implement the plan, but also because of a real threat of legal action against Ireland by the EU Commission for failure to adopt such plans. It is clear that what is needed now is full implementation of the plans.Thankfully, the implementation process is gathering pace and local authorities are now busy actively developing recycling and recovery facilities around the country. Now that progress is being made, I cannot allow for the possibility that backdoor attempts will be made to scupper these plans. The provisions of section 26(2)(b) will remove uncertainty going forward. I will ensure further progress is secured and, therefore, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 109 and 110.Turning to amendments Nos. 1, 10, 11 and 111, Deputies will recall that we had a lengthy discussion on waste stabilisation and zero waste on Committee Stage. The amendments seek to introduce into law the concepts of waste stabilisation and zero waste. The amendments aim to achieve this by an amendment of the Long Title of the Bill to refer to both concepts and an amendment of section 5 to include a definition of each. Many of the policies, objectives and actions promoted under so-called "zero waste" strategies have a lot of merit. We must tackle current production and consumption patterns, minimise waste generation and maximise recycling and recovery, all key elements in the waste hierarchy with which the Irish policy is wholly consistent. However, we must be honest in promoting zero waste targets for 20 or more years ahead.The concept of eliminating all waste that cannot be recycled remains to be validated by a single country. Proponents of zero waste strategies routinely promote existing initiatives as if they had achieved their stated targets. However, the cases of Ontario and Canberra, which we discussed on Committee Stage, give a flavour of the realities surrounding the concept of zero waste. Again, I emphasise that I cited those examples not for the purposes of being gratuitously disparaging towards the zero waste philosophy itself, but to illustrate that the concept remains a highly aspirational one. In these circumstances, I do not regard it as a realistic basis on which to develop waste policy, less still do I regard it as a concept appropriate to include in legislation.As for the issue of waste stabilisation, this is not a well defined or widely recognised concept. It is an aspirational objective, which is not appropriate to include in legislation. On the other hand, the integrated approach underpinning the Government's waste management planning is based on the internationally recognised hierarchy of waste prevention, namely, minimisation, reuse, recycle, energy recovery and residual landfill. There is little more I can add at this stage other than to reiterate my difficulties regarding these concepts and to repeat that I do not believe legislation is the appropriate place to set out aspirational objectives of the kind outlined. For these reasons and those outlined previously, I am not in a position to accept these amendments.As for amendment No. 113, I am not in a position to accept this as the prohibition on thermal treatment, which it would introduce, would undermine the respect for the waste hierarchy in the integrated approach to waste management that forms the key principles on which Irish waste management planning is based.As I said earlier in response to Deputy Sargent, who said there was no national strategy, I am surprised he is unaware of the 1998 report, "Changing our Ways", and the 2000 report on recycling, etc. There are clear national strategies in place.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	586	Furthermore, what I find interesting in that supposition when the Deputy and other Deputies talk about a negation of local democracy is that they complain about the regional waste management plans. According to the Green Party, we should not have them and should only have a national strategy.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	587	The Minister is not listening.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I have a double lock on this. We have a national strategy and empowerment at local level. We now have regional waste management strategies which have their own specific targets. We have the national strategies. We know those targets are ambitious, but realistic. These are enhanced by the regional waste management plans. Some regional authorities have set tough targets for themselves and I am delighted to see that. They want to drive this agenda forward, which I welcome.It is important to state that any proposal for a particular project would have to be approved by An Bord Pleanála in the case of a local authority development or by the relevant planning authority or the board in the case of a private development. Listening to Deputies, it is as if there will be no consultation, public involvement or planning engagement but, of course, that will happen. All the procedures are in place in regard to these issues and they will be brought into the public arena and there will be objections. Whether I change this Bill will not change any of that. All the changes will be discussed by the councils and the managers. The manager is free to listen to the council. I cannot direct him not to do so, nor am I directing any manager in the country. This Bill does not give an absolute direction to somebody to charge for waste when people do not pay their charges, but it gives that right. It is up to them at local level to take a view, and I think that is important—
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	589	Section 30 obliges them to do that.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	590	No, they may come to different conclusions in different local authorities. They may use other funding and deprive the community of other facilities if they want to, but my view is quite clear on this. Neighbours should not be subsidising neighbours for the collection of waste at a time when the vast majority of people are paying their charges.I suppose I will regret it for many years to come when I am trying to be helpful at a Dáil committee, but I have enunciated a particular reference as to the real cost of collection of waste. Of course, what nobody will go on to outline is the second half of my statement, that the whole purpose of re-use and recycling and the integrated segregated waste approach is very simple. We can substantially reduce our waste from what we were doing previously, which was to simply dump everything into one bin and dump it all in a landfill. As we move towards the basing of waste collection on weight, this will afford a real opportunity for all families around the country to substantially reduce their waste.I know from many different experiences of local authorities around the country that people have been able to substantially reduce their waste charges and costs because they have got into recycling. This is a fact of life. Some people may be better at it than others, but it depends on whether one is committed to this sort of idea or not. I hope that the whole of our society will be committed to it because the benefit is not just to the individual or parent but to all of us in society, and the communities we live in are clear about this.This is the direction in which we have to go, but if Deputies want to continue to be disingenuous about what I said, there is probably little I can do about it. In reality, however, we have strong evidence to show that already, waste costs of €200 or even €300 for individuals are being substantially reduced because they have gone into recycling and segregating their waste. They are only putting out a bin once every three or even four weeks, in some cases, where they used to put a bin out every week.Deputies are right that there are real choices for individuals and, I should say to Deputy Joe Higgins, for communities. A community can see itself in either a positive or negative light. I do not understand the argument being made that rubbish is going to pile up in people's gardens or outside gates. Over half the waste in this country is already being collected by private collectors and there is no difficulty. There is no waste piling up in any house or garden that I know of in any of these areas.If Deputy Joe Higgins wants to lead certain communities in this city in a particular direction that is his choice. It would deeply sadden me that this would happen, and I would say to the people living in these areas that they should think seriously before they are led in a misdirected way by what Deputy Joe Higgins is saying. People are legally obliged under both EU and Irish law to pay their waste charges. My point all along is that if everybody pays a small bit, the overall cost to everybody is substantially reduced.I know that other issues have been raised, and I want to refer specifically to other amendments. I want to be clear on one issue referred to by Deputies. They have questioned why a further amendment would be necessary with regard to where a waste management and development plan lies. I have done this for the specific reason that we already have a case of one local authority which uses its own development plan to sunder and shred the waste management plans that were in place. It did this against the advice of its officials who were present at the meeting and who told them that this was contrary to good planning, in the first place, and was a disastrous approach to take. Of course, however, the local authority members went off and did it. They did not care about good planning or anything else and just thought it was a clever rouse to undermine and shred the regional waste management plans. That is why I am doing it. If I needed any vindication—

A crisis, to me, is a crisis. It is not something to be talked up. Either we have a real, serious problem that has to be dealt with urgently and immediately, or we have not. I take the view that the former is the case, and the day for playing politics with these issues is long past.We spent years talking about it and did nothing. Sadly, it was not until the changes were made in previous laws in the last few years that we got the integrated regional waste management plans in place. That is the sad tragedy. Councillors and everybody else could have faced up to the issues ten years ago. I include myself in this criticism. I was a member of a local authority and was as guilty as anybody else. I should not excuse myself from the games that were played in local authorities, when people would not bite the bullet on this. However—
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The Minister had nerve. I remember him saying that in Waterford.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	595	The record will probably show, however, that I was very much to the fore in supporting the charges, supporting those issues and supporting a move in the development of how we service the whole area of waste. I did not see it at the time as an issue that could be handled entirely within the public sector. I saw it as requiring a mixture of the public and private sectors, but I saw it as a right of any local authority to make those choices having full regard to its own circumstances, its own financial base and the direction in which it wanted to go, such as whether it wanted to put an emphasis on community development, roads, water or whatever. Local authorities should have that right. Equally, the regional waste management strategy was a matter for local authorities, and many of them have made that choice with great and resounding success in many different areas.I have the choice, standing before the Dáil, to see to all of this and to put waste management back ten or 15 years. We know we are significantly short of landfill capacity. We are effectively on our last legs at present, bar one or two exceptions, and we desperately need to get that situation resolved. As I have already enunciated, we are making tremendous progress now – there is no question of that on the basis of any independent assessment – on recycling, re-use and composting, but we have a long way to go.The targets we have set for ourselves are quite stiff. They are serious targets but are realistic and in the interests of this country and its people, as well as those who might care to visit us now and again. Tourism is a very important part of our economy, and the country should be presented in a very positive light. This all feeds into that. It feeds into many industries such as fishing, which is equally important to us, by providing clean rivers and waters. A whole range of issues are being addressed.Yesterday in Dublin we opened what is effectively the latest and most modern waste water facility in the world, according to the engineers. It is the first time that a combination of all of these elements, which were really only being piloted up to now, have been brought together in a fully operational sense in a city the size of Dublin. It is the first capital city to have this facility in place which is at the cutting edge of everything that is happening throughout the world.We have strands of lots of things happening. Somebody else in my position may in the future – and I hope it is long into the future – want to reverse all of this, but I doubt it. I doubt it because the waste management situation will have been resolved and we will have a quality of environment that is equal to the best in Europe. We will have done that on the basis of clear, specific targets set out in national development and regional plans, which are in place. The targets are there if anybody wants to read them.For anybody to come into this House and suggest that there is no overall national strategy is a nonsense. Deputies are well aware of what we have done with construction and demolition waste and the way the building industry has responded positively. It has seen the hard line I have taken on packaging waste. It has also seen what Repak is achieving and what each of their individual councils are achieving. All of these things are happening. The danger is that we allow more games to be played and have all of this sundered. I am simply not prepared to accept that.On the other issue of end-of-life vehicles, I had signalled on Second Stage that I would bring in this directive. Deputy Gilmore correctly pointed out that the directive has been around for the last few years. It is important that we get it passed into law as we have a judgment against us in Europe. I have simply transposed the EU directive into Irish law. Deputies could have read that for the last three years, so there are no surprises. The amendment simply transposes the directive directly into the Bill, so there is no mystery there. It is not something that fell out of the sky yesterday or tonight. It is not an amendment I have brought in that was never heard of before. It has long been out there.Deputies have been on their feet during questions to the Taoiseach, Leaders' Questions and so no asking about this issue and about when the Government was going to deal with it. I was faced with the task of dealing with this issue and this Bill is the vehicle that provides me with the opportunity to do so.All these elements are part of an overall package or strategy, a way of dealing with these issues. All local authorities brought in the best experts to design their plans. Everyone throughout the European Union and beyond who is familiar with this area accepts that minimisation, reuse-recycling, landfill and thermal treatment are the four key elements of any decent acceptable waste hierarchy. Such people recognise that there are elements in waste, of which we are all aware, which cannot be recycled or removed entirely out of the system by minimisation such as plastic bags whereby we would not need landfill. We need certain elements of landfill and thermal treatment. That is the way to go. By getting the capacities and figures right and accepting what is a reality, we could move forward together.At a personal level, I am well used to the politics of this issue. I have been a Member of this House for a long time. We can all fight our corner and I respect that Members want to do that. However, I am genuinely disappointed that we cannot seem to collectively come to some conclusion and realisation that this is the way forward in dealing with these issues. We know what is stated to be the best international practice. I have spoken to councillors throughout the country who have been members of delegations who travelled to observe incinerators and thermal treatment plants throughout Europe and they have been amazed. They said they were fantastic and there is no problem with them, but they returned to their councils and voted against their introduction. That is laughable but it is the truth.

I find that astonishing. I have travelled with these councillors, as have others, and observed facilities abroad. When they see fantastic swimming pools, indoor and outdoor tennis and badminton courts and football pitches, even in small towns in many European countries, they ask why we cannot have such facilities in Ireland. The answer to that question is simple. These countries have a substantial level of local taxation and that is how they fund these and many more facilities. No member state of the European Union has as low a tax rate as we have.

What we have is precious to us and what we have we hold.In regard to waste management, I have said to Members that it is vital to continue to attract foreign direct investment and that we must have proper substantial waste management systems in place if we are to continue to do so. Foreign companies will not invest here if we do not have proper facilities in place to deal with waste. Members understand the strategies and they buy into all the EU directives, but they will lose out if they do not address this issue. I have said to people in different regions that those regions which implement their strategies in full and put the necessary facilities in place will have a unique selling point in terms of IDA Ireland and internationally by making such facilities part of what they will be able to deliver to any international organisation of note considering investing here. Waste management facilities and the strategies laid out to deliver and put in place the facilities will be crucial to the future development of many aspects of the well-being of the economy.Members wonder why I take tough decisions. I would prefer if it was different, but when I consider what recently happened where a local authority deliberately—

The councillors deliberately adopted their own development plan and were told by the officials during that debate that this was contrary to good planning, never mind anything else. They beamed ahead against all the advice given for one reason, so that they could walk out the door and say they would get rid of that waste management strategy, they would have no landfill and no thermal treatment facilities. They would pretend to people that there are other simple solutions and that waste could be swept under the carpet or exported, that they would not deal with it. That is the sort of nonsense that has vindicated – if I needed vindication – what I have done. If I had a doubt in my mind about this and where we were going with it, that, without question, brought home to me the necessity to go through with this Bill in the way that I have.There are some new and important amendments to the Bill. It is sad that after 20 hours of debate on Committee Stage the Deputies almost to a man resubmitted all the amendments we discussed at length and made it impossible to discuss new amendments. I recall that when I was newly elected to this House, Report Stage was different. It was not merely a case of recommitting all the Committee Stage amendments, we moved on and came up with new ideas, although one or two amendments might have been recommitted. Recommitting all the amendments makes a mockery of the seriousness of people trying to deal—

There are effectively two parts to this Bill. Much of what is in it is good, but there are big sections stuck in here and there dealing with the destruction of the local authority system, the amendments to which we are discussing. No matter what the Minister says about his record as a member of a local authority, Deputy Morgan who quoted from The Munster Express– I wish he would do so again—

I credit Deputy Morgan with quoting what the Minister said. He dared Padraig Flynn to abolish Waterford Corporation, of which he was a member at the time, when it would not fix charges.

If he examined the foundations of his party and of the State he would realise that if we had waited for other people to validate our breaking away from the British empire we might not have had an opportunity to do so at all.I wonder if there is any initiative left in Fianna Fáil that urges its members to be innovative enough to develop and design ideas to suit our needs—

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	632	—based on the type of innovation that led to the building of Ardnacrusha or the establishment of Bord na Móna or Siúcra Éireann. Such ideas were based on initiatives that were evident elsewhere, but they were sufficiently indigenous and were followed through and tailored to our needs. However, the agenda is being set by other countries and we are taking templates without examining them critically or developing a response according to our own best interests. Many of the countries from which we take templates have had more industrialisation than us and, as a result, they are trying to clean up after the mistakes of the past. Belgium serves as an example in this respect, where the state company Indaver NV is involved in the clean-up process.When the Minister referred to the importance of other sectors such as the tourism industry – I agree with him on that point – I am not sure that he mentioned agriculture. It will be severely affected if municipal incineration is introduced. The marketability of agricultural produce will be affected and the work of Bord Glas is being undermined by amalgamation with another State agency. These issues have already been raised by buyers internationally.The Minister should take on board wider interests rather than those of people who want to build incinerators. He should lead us forward without having to resort to incineration, as other countries are able to do.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	633	In the course of earlier contributions I mistakenly referred to section 30 instead of section 42, which deals with the charging regime.I disagree with some of my colleagues on the Opposition benches who say that there is no national strategy on waste. It is clear that there is – it involves burning it and burying it. Whether anybody likes it or not, the Minister will establish a number of incinerators, incinerate as much waste as he can and bury the rest.There is no ambiguity regarding what is intended. Unfortunately, there will be casualties, the first of which is local democracy. The Minister is introducing a new principle in the relationship between central and local government: if local government is not prepared to do what the Minister wants it to do, he will strip it of its powers. Local democracy, like democracy in all respects, is sometimes messy and does not always produce the result one wants. Decision making by the people and by their representatives sometimes gets complicated. If Galway County Council, or any other local authority, makes a decision, for whatever reason, that the Minister does not like, his approach is not to call councillors from his own party and talk to them about the issue but to abolish the power of every local authority.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I looked out the window to see if it was dark because I thought we were in the middle of the budget debate in December. This is what the Minister was referring to. The proposals in the Bill will not lead to waste reduction. The previous speaker was correct in stating that the cornerstone of the Bill was to burn and bury waste, and that is why I commend amendment No. 113 to Deputies. It proposes to delete references to thermal treatment and waste incineration in the waste management plan for the State.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I missed the Minister's response because I had to take an urgent telephone call concerning parliamentary business. Local democracy has died tonight and we now have direct rule from central Government through the county manager, who will impose his or her will on the people of his or her functional area by bypassing councillors. Councillors from Government parties hope they can wash their hands of unpopular decisions that are to be made.Local authorities will experience even greater shortfalls in funding in the coming year and the manager will make up for it by penalising the population of his or her area by imposing higher service charges. Service charges will rise to between €600 to €700 within a short time and they will be imposed directly by county and city managers. Our local elections will be held next June, but they will be effectively meaningless because councillors' most important powers and responsibilities – to decide to impose and to impose charges – will be taken from them. There are tough times ahead for local government and people will not accept the changes because there is now another layer of local taxes to supplement the wide range of stealth taxes we have experienced since the general election. Today, in the area of health, people have been penalised because of the lack of courageous decisions by a Minister who should have been dealing with manpower policies associated with the health brief rather than fiddling around with structures.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I am sorry that the Minister continually misses the point. In communities there is a great willingness to be environmentally conscious. Before any charges were introduced, in Fingal for example, people were separating their refuse and were very anxious to co-operate. What will not be accepted is the introduction, under the guise of environmental policy, of a separate tier of local taxation. The Minister cannot understand that. However, given that he is giving the county manager the right to set the level of taxation, householders know that pressure is being applied in certain quarters to impose further charges, such as water charges. Every household could face charges of over €1,000 in the space of a few years. Householders cannot afford this because the costs of everything else are also rising.The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, after consultation with the Minister's officials on the first day of Committee Stage, during which the Minister was ill, stated that section 49 of the Bill, which was giving the county manager the power to levy the charge, would be implemented for this year's council estimates. Will the Minister confirm that he will implement this section in time for this year's estimates?Having consulted the Minister's officials, the Minister of State also stated that section 26, providing that the variation of the waste plan be the responsibility of the county manager, would be implemented in the autumn and that the section now called section 29, which gives the councils the power – though not an interdiction – not to collect bins, would be implemented as and from September. Can the Minister confirm this?
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I listened intently to the Minister and I am sure he said something to the effect that it is not the intention under the Bill to oblige managers to charge for waste collection. He is not denying this, so I presume that is what he said. I presume the intention, therefore, is to bring in radical legislation that takes the powers away from local elected representatives, gives those powers to the manager to levy charges and starves the council of necessary funds, as has been happening with Dublin City Council for years. Considering all of this, are we seriously to believe it is not the intention to charge for waste collection?If the Minister is being honest and serious about the issues he addresses, he should withdraw his statement on charges. There is no doubt that the whole intent of this legislation is to force local authorities to charge and to introduce a new level of taxation, not only to force local authorities to charge for waste collection but to force them to massively increase the charges already in existence.The Minister will accept that this is an attempt to remove, the issue of local charges as a political issue to give the impression that councillors or people standing for local elections in the coming year will not have to deal with these issues, to imply that they will all be on a level playing pitch. The idea is that the Fianna Fáil councillors and others who have voted for minimal charges, but who would not tolerate the huge increases which it is intended to introduce, will no longer have to face the people on the issue of local charges. I presume this is occurring in the context of accepting the inevitable, namely that the obvious swing against the Government and Fianna Fáil on a whole range of issues will result, in the elections next year, in a majority of councillors who will oppose this Government and who will certainly oppose these charges.I want to refer to the Minister's attempt to suggest–

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	644	I am referring in general to the amendments and specifically to what the Minister stated when he was dealing with them. I want to put on record my opposition to this legislation in that it gives the lie to the Minister's previous legislation on the dual mandate. During the introduction of that legislation he claimed to be attempting to strengthen local democracy, when he is in fact taking away one of the few powers local elected representatives have, and handing it over to the city manager.There is also an attempt to introduce a new level of taxation. There is no point in blaming Deputy Joe Higgins for the people's opposition that will undoubtedly be widespread, particularly in Dublin. I can speak only for Dublin, and I know from the numbers of people who have already refused to pay these charges that there will be huge opposition to the tactics employed in this Bill, the anti-democratic tactics employed in the legislation, and the inevitable massive increases in charges that will result from starving local authorities of funds and handing the powers over to the manager to increase these charges. For these reasons, I am strongly opposed to this legislation.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	649	Local authorities are obliged to charge for waste collection under the "polluter pays" principle. They have no choice under Irish or EU law. There is no doubt in that area. Regarding those who do not pay their waste charges, the point I made is that the collection of waste by authorities is not compulsory. However, I expect that managers all over the country will implement non-collection as a last resort. I presume there will be considerable consultation with people if they have difficulties in that area, but the mangers now have that power. Moreover, that was the way everyone understood the law to be. Nobody thought it was any different. It was only when it was tested in a Supreme Court case that it was found to be otherwise. That is why I am now correcting it in this Bill, as a result of the Supreme Court decision.The implementation of the "polluter pays" principle is required under EU law. It is important to note that the EU has clearly indicated that this requires the levying of a charge on households. If we do not levy such charges, the EU will take us to court and fine this State, and the money of which we are currently short in the many areas to which the Deputies keep referring will be a lot more scarce. We understand the law. Moreover, as there were no charges in some parts of Dublin a few years ago, the EU Commission threatened to withdraw all EU funding for waste facilities on the basis of the absence of charges conflicting with the law in this area. Would the Deputies put Dublin in such a position? That is their choice.

The Minister is going for a quick-fix solution to problems that could be dealt with differently. I refer in particular to an incinerator in north Monaghan. Some 80% of its plume dioxins will go across to Northern Ireland, mirroring the situation we are opposing regarding Sellafield. We should re-think these things. We are talking about burning mushroom compost, which is viewed as a very valuable resource in areas like Denmark, where people cannot get enough of it. There are other ways of heat-treating it so that it becomes a very productive and fertile garden product. I ask those on the Government benches to reconsider.

The Minister has made a good case for extending this Dáil session into July because he has raised so many issues that need to be debated but which cannot be debated due to lack of time. I ask the Minister to take on board the unanimous views expressed by members of different Opposition parties that incineration is unacceptable as an option in the waste management strategies and that we must have waste reduction policies that work. As we do not have such policies, I ask the Minister to reconsider the zero waste strategies by not looking at countries where incineration takes place but at countries where there is no need for incineration.

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, formerly the Attorney General, should know that the aeroplane should not be on the runway in this condition. It is not in proper condition, nor is it airworthy and I advise the Minister to take the Bill off the runway and he might come back with a better flying machine.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	671	This Bill was introduced in February 2002 by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue. It has been around for a long time. It was fully dealt with in the Seanad and completed before the Minister decided to introduce substantial amendments. He obtained permission from Cabinet to introduce them last December. The amendments did not appear until two weeks ago and were two to three times the size of the original Bill. They are substantial amendments indeed. Last night, the Minister returned with a further ten pages of amendments.The Minister should know better. One should not introduce legislation in this fashion. The Bill had already been gutted to some extent by his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, when a major section of the Employment Permits Bill 2003 regarding migrant workers was removed. There will not be any opportunity for the amendments to be discussed in the Seanad, nor will we have an opportunity to discuss the amendments properly in this House. The Minister should have introduced the amendments as part of the substantive Bill and then we could have dealt with it in a proper fashion.I am not the only one who is looking for a recommittal. Opposition spokespersons and Members have also done so, as have civil liberties groups, including my former Seanad colleague, Mr. Maurice Manning, who is now chairman of the Human Rights Commission.

Mr. Manning has expressed grave concerns in regard to the legislation and asked for a deferral so that it can be properly examined. He also asked that his organisation could make oral submissions in regard to the Bill. A number of other organisations have also made this request. These include the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Refugee Council, Comhlámh and Amnesty International. The Minister in his wisdom, however, has decided that he is the only one that is right and therefore he is not going to listen to anybody.Before the last general election, the Minister accused the Taoiseach of acting in a Ceaucescu-like fashion in trying to establish monuments to himself as though he was some right-wing dictator. I have a feeling the Minister is going down that road very fast himself.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 4, line 4, after "boat," to insert "railway train,".The principal amendment to be discussed in this group is amendment No. 26, which inserts a new section 5 into the Bill. With the permission of the House I will concentrate on that amendment, since amendment No. 1 is simply a consequential drafting amendment to the interpretation section.The new section restates the law governing the removal of persons refused leave to land and in doing so gives effect to certain of our Schengen obligations in this area. Every state that operates immigration controls at its borders has provisions for the follow through to those controls, namely, ensuring that people who have been refused leave to enter the state are removed, usually to where they have just arrived from, as soon as possible. Without that, the controls are meaningless. There is broad acceptance that Ireland must have immigration controls and accordingly, we need to ensure that the removal process for people refused leave to land works effectively.The Amsterdam treaty imported into European law the content of the Schengen Agreement, which is operated as the basis for free movement of people among some of the continental member states of the EU. Due to the fact that the UK did not wish to participate fully in the free movement provisions, it negotiated a protocol to the treaty whereby it could choose which elements of the acquis it would share. Given the importance to Ireland of the common travel area arrangements between ourselves and our neighbours in the UK, we negotiated our own protocol enabling Ireland to participate in Schengen to the greatest degree possible consistent with maintaining the common travel area. In line with that policy we have opted into Articles 26 and 27 of the Schengen Agreement and thus into the various Council directives which supplement those articles. Article 26 is concerned with the operation of entry controls, as is the associated directive, Council Directive 2001/51/EC. The provisions of sections 2 and 3 of this Bill fulfil Ireland's obligations under those instruments as far as carrier liability is concerned. This new section will implement our remaining obligation under the instruments. Those obligations relate to the removal of persons refused leave to enter the State and the role of carriers in facilitating that process.Subsection (1) of the new section inserted by the amendment is more or less in line with the present law. It sets out to whom these arrangements apply – in general terms, non-nationals who have just arrived at a port or airport and have been refused leave to land by an immigration officer on any of the 13 grounds provided for in Article 5(2) of the Aliens Order 1946 and non-nationals who have been apprehended within the State having entered irregularly in breach of this order. The proposed section will not apply to anyone who last arrived in the State more than three months before coming to notice. The removal of such a person must take place through the deportation process.Subsection (2) provides the power of arrest and detention to an immigration officer or a member of the Garda Síochána in respect of a person refused leave to land. That is also in line with the present law, but with one important exception, set out in paragraph (b) of the subsection. Persons under the age of 18 are excluded from detention. This is not provided for under the present law relating to removal following refusal of leave to land. Young people who arrive in the State unaccompanied are covered by section 8(5) of the Refugee Act 1996, which provides that the local health board should take control of the child in those circumstances. Paragraph (d) sets out the involvement of the health board where the parents are detained for removal under that section. This is similar to the provisions for that situation where a deportation order has been enforced.Subsection (3) is also modelled on the provisions in the Immigration Act 1999 relating to the deportation process. The subsection makes it clear that detention under this provision is for the purpose of removal, which should take place as soon as practicable, and that detention cannot go on for more than a total of eight weeks. The subsection sets out the periods, similar to the deportation provisions, which are not to be included when reckoning the total of eight weeks. Subsection (4) is also modelled on the deportation provision and concerns the question of detention where court proceedings are taken challenging the removal.Subsection (5) sets out the choice of places, based on the Schengen instruments, to which a refused person may be sent. The most usual outcome, at paragraph (a), is that the person is returned to the place where he or she last embarked for the State. Paragraph (b) deals with the case of a person refused leave to land while in transit through the State, where the carrier due to take the person out of the country refuses to board the person or the authorities of the state of destination have refused the person entry to the State and sent him or her back to Ireland. In those circumstances the usual procedure is for the person to be returned to the state of his or her original embarkation. Other options are to send the person to the state that issued his or her passport or travel document, which is catered for in paragraph (c), to the country of nationality – paragraph (d) – or, as set out in paragraph (e), to any country in which the person is guaranteed entry.Subsections (6) and (7) address the logistics of actual removal in the same way as at present. Similar provisions are to be found in the 1999 Act for removal and deportation cases. Subsections (8) and (9) require co-operation with the removal and make it an offence to hinder the process. Subsection (10) gives to an immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána the power to issue directions to a carrier for the purpose of returning a person brought in by that carrier, where the carrier is known, which is the case in the majority of refusals to land. These new powers are an enhancement of the present powers. The enhancement arises directly from the Schengen instruments. Most importantly among these new features, paragraph (d) of subsection (10) allows alternative arrangements for removal to be made where the carrier fails or is unable to comply with the direction. Under paragraph (e), the costs incurred in those alternative arrangements in terms of maintenance, detention or removal may be recovered from the carrier as a simple contract debt through the courts.Under subsections (11) and (12), failure to comply with a direction is an arrestable offence. Subsection (13) repeals the provisions of the Aliens Order 1946, which are now superseded by the provisions of this section. Subsection (14) is a transitional provision. I commend amendments Nos. 1 and 26 to the House and I propose to accept Deputy Costello's amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 26.

We still do not have a chunnel between Ireland and France or Spain. Even travelling by Luas or metro, it is very unlikely that we will ever get around to building such a direct link.

Section 1(1) defines "vehicle" as including "any ship, boat, aircraft or mechanically propelled vehicle within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1961". The Minister is now adding a railway train to that list. Section 2(1) refers to a vehicle arriving in the State, so does that not include a railway train? The definition of "vehicle" is now extended in section 1 to include a railway train but this is the same vehicle we are talking about in section 2(1). Surely there is not a second definition of what constitutes a vehicle. So, where a vehicle arrives in the State from a place other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland, that definition includes a railway train, yet it is impossible for a train to arrive in the State other than from Northern Ireland. I cannot see how we are going to do it unless we have a railway tunnel running under the sea from Britain, or an almighty bridge from Stranraer to Larne.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	750	—I will accept his word for it. Amendment No. 26 is a substantial one running to six pages. It is evidence of what I was saying earlier; this Report Stage amendment was only made available yesterday. The amendment is almost a contradiction in terms because the explanatory wording in the margin states that it refers to the "removal from the State of persons refused leave to land". It is very difficult to remove somebody from the State if he or she has not been allowed to land there, unless the Minister means that "the State" includes the territorial waters.My amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 26, which the Minister intends to accept, requires the insertion of "section 4 of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000". The amendment will have the effect of increasing protection for people who will be subject to this legislation.Section 26(3)(a) statesA person arrested and detained under this section may, subject to subsection (4), be detained only until such time (being as soon as practicable) as he or she is removed from the State in accordance with this section but, in any event, may not be detained for a period exceeding 8 weeks in aggregate.My amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 26 seeks after "practicable" to insert "but subject, in the case of a person who informs any member of the Garda Síochána, authorised person or immigration officer in whose custody he or she is of his or her intention to seek legal advice, to a reasonable opportunity being given to avail of such advice." An entitlement to legal advice should be included in the section in order that such advice would be made available if sought. This protection is expected under the 1951 Geneva Convention.Amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 26 relates to the choice of country. The other two amendments are technical.

Amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 26 refers to legal services but we cannot have a court case every time somebody lands or seeks admission to the State.Amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 26 introduces another complicating factor, which is a choice of destination for a person refused leave to land. In fact, most people do not have a choice in these circumstances and the real problem is for the Irish authorities to identify a state to which they can be returned. I do not propose to confer that choice on the arriving person. If people are refused leave to land, a practical and workable immigration law requires that the Irish State should make the decision as to where they are sent back.

It is about time one of those was replaced. Will the Minister of State elaborate on the difference between the Principal Act and the amended Act? Deputy Burton's amendment could be valid and correct. I recall contributing to the debate on the Interpretation (Amendment) Act 1993 and similar issues were raised.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	790	Deputy Durkan will recall that that legislation referred to gender proofing and that is why is it is relevant to this debate. The Act referred to by Deputy Burton related to interpreting common law as a consequence of its abolition by statute. A particular case gave rise to interpretation of common law but the Long Title of this legislation refers to an Act respecting the interpretation and application of Acts and statutory instruments. Common law is not being interpreted.

In page 6, line 33, after "Act" to insert ", other than a provision that relates to the imposition of a penal or other sanction".As I stated on Committee Stage, section 5 only applies in restrictive circumstances and only where the plain intention of the Act, as a whole, is ascertainable. The section reflects the considerations of the Law Reform Commission in its report, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law. Given the concerns expressed on Committee Stage by Deputy Burton, I undertook to examine the matter and refer back on Report Stage. As a result, I am satisfied the application of the section, which in its present form would be extremely limited, should be further restricted to ensure it will not be used in the context of a penal or other sanction. However, if we were to go further and impose the restrictions outlined in Deputy Burton's amendment, the section would be rendered inapplicable in virtually every circumstance. My amendment goes some way towards addressing the issues raised on Committee Stage.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I thank the Minister for acknowledging the Labour Party's position that the Bill was defective because it did not refer to provisions that would impose criminal or civil obligations on individuals. I do not know whether "penal or other sanction" is better wording because that could cover both criminal and civil scenarios. Will the Minister of State elaborate? I am not a lawyer and I am prepared to take her advice in this regard.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	794	The Minister of State's amendment is less specific than Deputy Burton's, which states "other than provisions which impose or would, if this section were applied, impose a criminal or civil obligations on individuals". The Minister of State's amendment states "other than a provision that relates to the imposition of a penal or other sanction". The other sanction could be serious or minor and I am not certain whether Deputy Burton's amendment is better. It would be more precise in terms of application and would be in less danger of being abused in the event of an interpretation. Perhaps the Minister of State will elucidate on this issue. I would be happier with Deputy Burton's amendment.

In page 6, line 34, to delete "or ambiguous".The Bill contains the wording "is obscure or ambiguous". Our advice is that it should only read "is obscure" because it is not appropriate to confess that legislation is being introduced which is ambiguous. It is not advisable to leave the term "ambiguous" in the legislation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	799	The use of the word "ambiguous" is considered to be an integral feature of the section, as it delimits the circumstances of its application. The word was used by the Law Reform Commission, which gave it significant consideration. The Deputy also referred to the words "plain intention". The primary aim in employing the test commencing with those words "or would fail to reflect the plain intention of" is to ensure that in cases of uncertainty the intention of the Parliament would be adhered to while the phrase "in respect of a statute" refers a concept with which the Judiciary is familiar. "Ambiguous" is an accepted word for delimiting the circumstances and "plain intention" is a commonly used and understood phrase by the Judiciary. This is why we feel we should retain them.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	800	This is unsatisfactory regarding certain statutes, particularly those concerning tax law. It is what is said in the Act that is important. In different areas of law, judges may react depending on the matter under consideration. Section 5(1)(b) states, “that on a literal interpretation would be absurd or would fail to reflect the plain intention of – [the Oireachtas].” This is inadequate because it could be dicey to ask judges to interpret what was the plain intention of the Oireachtas. Allowing for a liberal interpretation would make for stronger legislation. It may be more onerous on the parliamentary counsel who must come up with better language that will stand up to legal tests. We have just listened to the redoubtable and esteemed former barrister and Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, lay about him regarding such diverse subjects as the Taoiseach, Ceaucescu, whether the Taoiseach was a communist and so on.In years to come, how will a judge interpret the plain meaning of all of that if, for instance, he or she is to be guided back to what was the plain intention of the Oireachtas? Half an hour ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was waving his arms and saying regarding his point of view that he had the plain people of Ireland on his side. In the future, will some judge try to interpret the plain people of Ireland regarding the Bill before us? It is a slightly dangerous concept and I would like to hear why the Minister of State insists it should be included in the Act.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	801	I agree with Deputy Burton in this regard. I spoke about the matter previously in the House. I cannot understand why we must be vague and leave the courts or judges to interpret what we were thinking. I find it difficult to understand how they could possibly have any way of finding out what we were thinking when we passed legislation. We should be precise in the way we word legislation, in which case there can be no doubt about it, or we can be vague, which will leave a labyrinth of areas where our good friends in the legal profession can course at will to try to arrive at what they thought we in the Oireachtas were thinking when we phrased a Bill in a particular fashion.It is not the first time this argument has arisen; it has arisen on many occasions during my time in the House. I would like to underpin what Deputy Burton said by saying that perhaps the time has come for us to be more precise and less ambiguous, ambivalent, vague and nebulous in the way we do what we do. We should make quite clear what we are saying to all and sundry, and to the plain people of Ireland. Whenever I hear references to them, I always think about a former leader of the party opposite whom it was said used to look into his heart to find out what the people of Ireland were thinking. It takes a certain amount of expertise to come up with that one. Many politicians have tried it over the years and failed. I would like to hear further from the Minister of State on the benefits of the proposal versus the amendment.

In fact, it is to close down ambiguity because this is the Interpretation Bill. What we are trying to do is to ensure there is a more precise legislative and legal process. Why is there such ambiguity that legislation such as this is necessary? I am on record as welcoming the Bill, and I again want to record my support. One of the critical deficiencies on which my colleagues have not yet reflected, but we all did at the appropriate time, is that, by and large, the only legal assistance in terms of the processing of legislation is that which is available to Government and to Ministers through the Attorney General and his team. While Deputy Burton referred to legal advisers to the Labour Party, I have no such legal advisers available to me in terms of my contribution to this debate. Deputy Durkan is in the same position.We made the point then, and I ask the Minister of State again, whether she has taken on board our appeal that, first, access to the advice of the Attorney General be made available to all Deputies and, second, to the proposition that we would have legal advisors available to all Members of the House in order that we will have the opportunity to properly inform ourselves in terms of our role as legislators? Currently that is not provided. Interpretation Bills and ambiguity will always be a part of the reality of legislation and the judicial process until such time as we have a more precise passage of legislation, scrutiny and discussion within the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is wholly deficient at the moment and I re-echo my appeal on Committee Stage to the Minister of State to take on board that request.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	803	Obviously it should be the aim of all of us as legislators to ensure we pass legislation which is not ambiguous and is clear. The time we give to all Stages of legislation proves that is our intention.As regards Deputy Ó Caoláin's point about legal support and legal representation, all parties have access to wonderful junior and senior counsel who voluntarily give of their time to Opposition parties to support the drafting of amendments and legislation. I am sure the Deputy will find someone in the Law Library who will be happy to support the work. Equally, political parties are grant aided each year and the money can be used for research purposes or for legal assistance. Perhaps the political parties will decide to put some of the money towards new law graduates who will be happy to help out. Perhaps we can consider the needs of all Deputies in progressing legislation through the House in the context of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill, which was passed recently, and the commission which will be in place next year.To get back to the point of the plain intention, the principle of this has been established in the courts in Mulcahy v. the Minister for the Marine in 1994. It is to ensure that where there is uncertainty the intention of Parliament is adhered to. We might pass a Bill which is clear as daylight, and that might still be the case next year. In 50 or 100 years' time, when that Act is still on the Statute Book, the clarity which we think exists may not apply. Deputies know we have a lot of legislation dating back to the Victorian age and knowing the clear intentions of that time is not so easy. That is why it is important to build this into the legislation.The phrase "clear intention" has been used by the court. Mrs. Justice Denham in Howard and others v. the Commissioners of Public Works said the correct conclusion to be drawn is that the plain language of an Act must not be extended beyond its natural meaning so as to supply omissions or remedy defects and that the court should neither misconstrue words so as to amend defects in the legislation nor legislate to fill gaps left in the Legislature – that is exactly what we would expect of the courts. The judgment goes on to state that if a plain intention is expressed by the words of a statute then the court should not speculate but rather construe the Act as enacted.The principle is that the courts should interpret the legislation as we pass it and see what was the plain intention of the Bill. In light of what Deputy Burton said about exchanges on the previous legislation, I am not sure her next amendment is appropriate, given that it seeks the position of the Minister to be written into this. As "plain intention" is something we need to retain to ensure there is no ambiguity and that legislation can stand the test of time, it is important to keep it in the Bill.

They might use the opportunity this evening to appear in the spirit of volunteerism in the country – some of them might like to come forward. I would welcome their services.The Minister of State did not address the first point regarding the Attorney General's advice, which may be an aside but is central to what we are addressing. The Government has sole and solitary access to that advice. My point was that that advice should be made available to all parties represented here; that is not something that should challenge the Government too much. Rather than pointing Opposition parties towards goodwill or the private sector approach, would it not be better for us to have in-house legal advice available to us all as Members? That is a major deficiency here and it is an inescapable point.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	805	If the Labour Party amendments were accepted, section 5 would state that in construing a provision that is obscure and that on a literal interpretation would be absurd, the literal interpretation may be departed from and preference given to an interpretation based on the plain intention of the Oireachtas or Parliament concerned, as the case may be.The addition the Minister of State has included is almost a form of coat-trailing where the courts are being invited to go behind what happened in the debate. I am reminded particularly of the situation regarding the disability legislation, when Members may recall the then President, Mary Robinson, referring a Bill to the Supreme Court. The consequence of that interpretation by the judges was that they struck down sections of the Bill, even though during the debates on the legislation the Oireachtas had never intended striking down disability provisions on the grounds that they would impose burdens of cost on owners of property or businesses.The Labour Party proposal would create a much more logical structure, which would also be consistent with amendment No. 10, although we will probably not reach it. That amendment would include a provision having regard to any assurance given by the Minister sponsoring the enactment or the maker of the instrument in the course of or in connection with parliamentary proceedings prior to its enactment or making. For example, on the legislation governing the dual mandate, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government undertook to provide regulations regarding elected representatives maintaining contact and a flow of information from council managers and staff. Members accepted that but we still have not seen those regulations; I understand the Minister intends to produce them shortly.Ministers often give undertakings which are not reflected in the statutes as finally printed but which are politically important. In this case, they are particularly important for Government backbenchers regarding the dual mandate. If the Minister does not produce those regulations, not only will his life be made miserable but the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, will also have a miserable time in getting backbenchers to resign from councils. Commitments given by Ministers are important. They are often very unambiguous and are stated on Committee Stage in order that political deals may be struck with backbenchers or more widely.

That goes back to what we were saying earlier about ensuring that the text we draft is one that is accurate and not ambiguous or obscure. To allow for a situation where anything a Minister might say in introducing legislation would be statutorily allowed to be used or interpreted would not be a good precedent. The legislation should stand on its own without having regard to the actual debate. Through case law, the courts develop principles by which other aids to interpretation can be used and one hears of Dáil debates being used and so on but I am not satisfied we should allow for that in legislation rather than letting the case law develop as it progresses.

The Minister for Finance indicated in the last budget that the tax incentives that the film industry has enjoyed will be looked at, which is timely. In any good tax incentive scheme, review is always an important and vital part of it. The reason I am particularly interested in the review which will be conducted is that it gives us the opportunity to applaud and appreciate the pioneering work of section 481 which has allowed the Irish film industry to develop at an unprecedented rate. When I say "pioneering", I do not use that word lightly. Ireland is well known as having this pioneering legislation. Legislation has also been introduced to provide tax incentives to artists. As somebody who worked in the arts industry in England, I know they always turn to Ireland as an example of how things should be progressed.The decision to introduce this incentive was a courageous and an important economic one because, as a result, the Irish film industry has developed into a thriving one. Ten years ago, six feature films were made in this country while last year, 21 feature films were made. If incentives such as this are to continue, God knows how many films will be made. It will probably reach three figures.A report published recently indicates that this industry, given the care and attention it has already received until now with incentives such as section 481, will grow at an extraordinary rate. It has been indicated that the industry is growing at an annual rate of 18%.I wish to make a case for the retention of section 481, or something similar to it, for the film industry. It has been suggested that the economic cost of this incentive is roughly €25 million in taxes forgone. However, not quite that amount of money has been forgone. Much of the money forgone has come back to the State because a lot of it was used to pay wages, PRSI, VAT and so on. It has been calculated that the actual cost has only been €10 million. The economic return on the other hand is somewhere in the region of 3:1. Some 4,300 people are employed directly and it is estimated that another 3,000 are employed indirectly in tourism related to the film industry. That is quite extraordinary. I visit Connemara regularly and I meet people who constantly refer to where "The Quiet Man" was filmed. The places where films have been shot remain part of a community.The Minister has indicated that he is in favour of incentives, particularly property related ones which were needed in the 1980s in order to incentivise development. The standard incentives available to other businesses are not really available to the film industry, in particular the attractive corporation tax rates and IDA grants. In effect, section 481 is the equivalent of those incentives and that is why I will press the case for a retention of that scheme, or an acknowledgement of what it has brought to this country and how it has developed an important industry.If we are to look forward and if the number of feature films made annually is to reach three figures, we need certainty, and I appreciate the Minister would be interested in something such as this. Certainty comes from proposing long-term objectives. Perhaps we might think of putting a ten or five-year scheme in place which would be subject to review. We have developed an attractive labour force and have trained individuals. We should applaud the incentives which others have copied. I hope the extent and importance of this industry will be acknowledged.

I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, who, unfortunately, cannot be here.The Irish film business has come a long way in recent years. Success has been achieved in both the indigenous sphere, which has seen fine Irish works produced, and by way of attracting international productions to this country.In Ireland, we believe that there cannot be a question of whether it is better to promote Irish films than to attract international productions, but that we must do both. Irish films reflect our culture, outlook and our lives but international productions bring economic benefits, they allow our practitioners to work with, and learn from, the best in the world and they showcase Ireland to large numbers of people around the world.The status and calibre of the Irish film continues to be recognised in a variety of prestigious international festivals and markets. In this context, we can refer to "Bloody Sunday" and the "Magdalene Sisters," both of which have achieved critical acclaim as well as commercial success. We are still attracting major international productions, such as "King Arthur," which is currently a work in progress.Concern has been expressed about the future of our section 481 tax relief scheme for investment in film production and, in recent days, we have had significant coverage of this issue if the media. The relief is scheduled to discontinue from the end of 2004 and we are looking forward to where we go from that point.Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended, is a statutory tax-based incentive for investment in film production in Ireland. Irish taxpayers receive tax relief on 80% of the amount of their investment. Investment is by way of shares in a company set up specifically to receive these funds for the production of the film. It should be noted that "film" for the purpose of section 481 includes feature films, short films, television drama, creative documentary and animation. Productions must be made for theatrical release or television broadcast, including cable network transmission.Recently in Cannes, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, restated that film production is, and will remain, important to Ireland, that we value the benefits international production in Ireland brings with it and that we will be looking carefully over the coming months at the entire context. This will involve a complete review of the existing incentive structures, of where they position us strategically and competitively and where we need to position ourselves after 2004 to ensure that we remain attractive as a filming location. In all of this, we will be working closely with the Irish Film Board.Screen Producers Ireland has just released its study on the importance of this incentive, which is a useful analysis of the position. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, in collaboration with the Irish Film Board, has commissioned a separate study by PriceWaterhouse Coopers of what discontinuation of the section 481 incentive would mean to the sector and outside the sector. This study is expected to take around eight weeks to complete and on receipt of its conclusions, decisions will be taken on how best to proceed.The Irish Film Board is a central plank of our approach to developing a viable Irish film sector and will remain so into the future. The primary function of the board is to provide development and production finance for Irish film projects. Development loans are given to provide resources to allow a project to be brought from the drawing board to the stage of being a properly researched and developed project ready to be taken to the production stage. Production loans contribute towards the cost of producing a finished film or documentary project. By providing these loans, the board is providing the opportunities needed by emerging Irish talent and, through schemes such as Short Cuts, has launched the careers of a number of young Irish film makers.The board also supports more established companies in producing cultural Irish films which have significant commercial prospects. It also provides, under its capital provision, funds for film training carried out by the National Training Committee for Film and Television established under FÁS legislation, known as Screen Training Ireland. The board also provides, under its capital provision, funds for film training, carried out by the national training committee for film and television established under FÁS legislation, known as Screen Training Ireland. It is inevitable that any body like the Irish Film Board will come in for quite a bit of criticism. This probably just comes with the territory.However, the board is by and large doing a good job. Of course people in the sector get annoyed when they feel that the board does not share their vision of what constitutes a worthwhile project, or that the—

It must be remembered that the board is ploughing a very difficult furrow and has to balance a number of agendas which require different approaches. For example, what it takes to attract a major international production to Ireland is quite different from what is needed to give a neophyte film maker his first entry to the sector, and the board must do its best to cater for people at both ends of the spectrum and those in between.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this important topic. This concerns a health centre at Millbrook Lawns, a very populous area of my constituency, which provides a range of services like public health nursing, speech and language therapy, community welfare and home help, social work, addiction and general services and so on.The premises itself is quite unsuitable for the service that it offers. Needless to remark, there is an enormous client base in the immediate environment of this health centre. The premises have been scheduled for demolition for some time and a new health centre scheduled to be built in the area. However, the reason I am in the House tonight is that four years ago, in June 1999, a fire occurred at these premises and nine rooms were burned down or seriously damaged, including a large waiting area and a storage facility. Believe it or not, four years later the premises have not been refurbished.Quite frankly, I do not know if a health board that has permitted this to happen and tolerated this neglect over four long years is worthy of the name. I have not commented one way or another about anticipated imminent proposals about the abolition of health boards, but quite frankly, this health board ought to be demolished purely on the basis of its neglect of this health centre.Four years on, the public health nurses are driven to protest behind a picket in order to give a voice to their grievance. They, in particular, have been very badly affected. They have lost three clinic rooms, one dressing room, one interview room and one baby changing room. They were allocated to temporary, unsuitable accommodation and found that their previous premises had been usurped by the addiction services. After considerable interaction with management, they were moved back into what is overcrowded and unsuitable office space. They were told this was for a temporary period of six months, that plans to build a new health centre were proceeding and that they should be prepared to tolerate impossible working conditions while that was happening.Unfortunately, things have gone from bad to worse, and the facilities the people of the area so badly need are so constrained by the inadequacy of the conditions from which the professional and other staff must operate. It is absolutely imperative that we get some kind of answer from the Minister about why he is tolerating this situation and when the refurbishment of the premises will be initiated and completed.The facilities are manifestly unsuitable for the purposes intended. There seems now to be a question mark over whether the new health centre is going ahead. The health board sold premises on the main street of Tallaght and realised considerable money from the sale. Yet, the money has not been put into a health centre in the middle of a hugely working class area where there is a very serious need for the services on offer. It is intolerable that staff be expected to function out of such a premises.On the fourth anniversary of the fire, the nurses are driven to picket the place in an attempt to have proper services restored. I ask the Minister to give a commitment to the House that he will personally direct either that work immediately commences on the refurbishment of this health centre or that a commitment is given to the approval for the construction of a new health centre that is so badly needed in the area.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	819	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter to which I am happy to have the opportunity to respond. At the outset, I am acutely aware of the key role that the health centres play at community level in the delivery of a wide range of services to local populations. For many, the local health centre is the first point of contact with the health services. It is important, therefore, that the facilities are customer-friendly in terms of being modern, well-equipped and accessible.I take this opportunity to underline the Government's commitment to the development of integrated community-based health and personal social services. Such development forms a central element of the recent health strategy and was elaborated on in the primary care strategy, Primary Care – A New Direction.On the issue of health centre developments generally, the position is that the identification, prioritisation and provision of such facilities to meet the needs of local communities within its functional area is a matter for the relevant health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of Millbrook Lawns, this responsibility rests with the ERHA. I have been advised by the ERHA that since the fire in 1999, various repairs and improvements have taken place. These include the internal and external painting of the premises, roof repairs, increased parking, enhanced security measures, new fire alarm, additional public toilets as well as new office space for nursing, social work, community welfare and speech and language services. In fact, a health and safety audit conducted in November 2002 noted significant improvements since the previous inspection and further recommendations from this recent audit are being actively addressed.The re-development of the centre is a priority capital project for the South West Area Board and submissions to obtain the necessary funding have been made to the ERHA. The South West Area Board continues to work with the ERHA on this matter. However, any such proposals would, in the first instance, have to be considered by the ERHA in the context of its overall priorities for capital developments and in line with funding resources available under the national development plan.Local management and staff have met on a number of occasions to discuss concerns in relation to current facilities and the development of a new centre. These discussions will continue to ensure that conditions in the existing centre are maintained to a satisfactory level and that the effective delivery of services to the public continues. Currently, the existing health centre provides a comprehensive range of community based health and personal services including public health nursing, developmental clinics, dental, speech and language therapy, community welfare, home help, social work and addiction services. Pre-school services are also provided.It is planned to relocate the addiction services before the end of 2003. All capital requirements for the health boards, including the ERHA, are funded under the national development plan. The Department of Health and Children is at present reviewing, from a national perspective, the national development plan for each health board.This process encompasses providing for existing capital contractual commitments and, where possible, the planning or construction of new projects this year and into the future. It is in this context that capital developments for the ERHA are being considered. The Department fully appreciates the importance of progressing such developments and will continue to work closely with the authority regarding prioritising its overall capital needs in line with the funding resources under the NDP.

Is é an tionscal a bhí i gceist an oíche sin againn ná BMR, áit a raibh 48 post le cailleadh agus tá siad caillte ó shin. Déardaoin seo caite, agus muid réidh le dul abhaile, tháinig an scéal fríd go bhfuil an tionscal is mó, is sine agus is seasmhaigh ar an eastát i dtrioblóid – Comerama.Chuaigh glacadóir isteach sa tionscal Déardaoin agus inné d'éirigh rudaí níos measa nuair a fuair lucht oibre ansin fógra cosanta fostaíochta. Tá beagnach 200 ag obair sa mhonarchan sin. Tá 200 sa mhonarchan sin ag fáil an íocaíochta chéanna a gheobhadh 300 i monarchan eile. Is ard-mhonarchan é, bhí ard ráta pá acu agus b'fhiú €5 mhilliún ar a laghad sa bhliain an tionscal sin don eacnamaíocht sa cheanntar Gaeltacha sin – na Rosann, Gaoth Dóbhair agus Cloch Cheann Fhaola.Mar a sheasann rudaí i láthair na huaire beidh lucht oibre ag fáil a gcuid laethanta saoire i gcoicís nó mar sin agus ní bheidh siad ag teacht ar ais ina dhiaidh sin agus beidh siad ag brath ar téarmaí iomarcaíochta. Má bheidh éinne ag teacht ar ais, ní bheidh ach 20 nó 30 le rudaí a ghlanadh suas agus a shocrú síos. Tá mé cinnte go n-aontaíonn an tAire gur buille é seo don cheanntar.An bhfuil stráitéis de chineál ar bith againn? Tá plean gníomhaíochta curtha ar fáil don eastát ach tá na postanna ag imeacht – 800 go dtí seo agus 200 eile anois. Sin 1,000 míle posta i gceanntar beag cúng Gaeltachta. Is ionann sin agus 10,000 i mBaile Átha Cliath nó i nGaillimh. Caidé tá ag dul a tharlú do na daoine seo? Tá aithne agam ar go leor acu – tuismitheoirí clainne le freagrachtaí orthua, morgáistí agus mar sin.Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire caidé tá ag dul ar aghaidh agus go gcoinníonn sé a chluas leis an talamh. Tá siad ag cur locht ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, ar Thailand, agus ar an Tánaiste ach caithfimid an locht a chur ar na polasaithe eacnamaíochta atá ag fágáil an cineál seo tionsclaíochta san racht ina bhfuil sé – an ráta bolscaithe atá sa tír seo le blianta go bhfuil costaisí targaíochta chomh hard sin: cúrsaí cumarsáide agus cúrsaí árachais. Tá sin go léir ag cur an saghas fostaíochta a bhí againn i Comer Yarns, BMR, RMT, SMTC, EPI agus Europlast ar strae. Tá siad uilig ar shiúl, tá na doirse dúnta agus iad faoi ghlas.Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an tAire ábalta dóchas de chineál éigin a thabhairt do na daoine seo nach mbeidh ag teacht ar ais ag obair nuair a bheidh na laethanta saoire thart. B'fhéidir go bhfuil comhlacht amuigh ansin go bhfuil fonn air an áit a cheannacht agus, más rud é go bhfuil, b'fhéidir go bhfuil sólás aige ansin. Níl a fhios agam caidé a thig a dhéanamh ach tá a fhios agam má dhúntar an monarchan níl a fhios agam cén áit a bhfuil na daoine seo chun fostaíochta eile a fháil. San am a chuaigh thart, bhí tráidisiúin láidir sa cheanntar na daoine ag fágáil agus ag dul thar lear. Níor mhaith liom go dtarlóidh sin arís ach muna gcuirtear fostaíocht ar fáil do na daoine a chaill a gcuid post sna monarchain sin go léir, beidh trioblóidí móra againn.Más rud é go dtig sé go dtí an drochuair agus go bhfuil na postanna caillte, tá súil agam go mbeidh téarmaí iomarcaíochta ar fáil a chuirfidh an drochuair tharstu go bhfaighfidh siad post eile.

Tuigim go raibh sé buartha mar tá beirt TD eile sa dáilcheanntar atá buartha, an tAire Mary Coughlan agus an tAire Stáit Gallagher, go bhfuil an oiread seo postanna i mbaol agus go bhfuil an oiread seo postanna caillte ceann i ndiaidh a chéile i gceanntar Ghaoth Dobhair. Déanfaidh mé gach rud gur féidir liom mar Aire féachaint cad is féidir a dhéanamh faoin gcruachas seo.Tá fadhbanna bunúsacha ann – tá muid inár gcónaí sa saol anois le hiomaíocht domhanda ann agus tá daoine i dtiortha eile a oibríonn ar phá i bhfad níos lú ná mar is féidir linn a bheith ag súil leis in Éirinn mar go bhfuil caighdeán maireachtála i bhfad níos measa acu. Níor mhaith liom go dtiocfaimis ar ais go dtí an lá go raibh an cineál caighdeán maireachtála againne agus atá ag na daoine sin. Tá dúshlán romhainn agus caithfimid féacháint le tabhairt faoi.Mar is eol don Teachta, Déardaoin seo caite, cheap Banc Uladh Pearce Farrel FCA ó FGS Chartered Accountants and Business Consultants mar ghlacadóir ar ghrúpa comhlachtaí Comer, a bhí lonnaithe i gCaisleán an Chomair i gCondae Cill Chainnigh go dtí deireadh na bliana seo caite agus i nGaoth Dobhair i gCondae Thír Chonaill.Cheadaigh Gaeltarra Éireann, an comhlacht Stáit a bhí freagrach as cúrsaí fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht sular bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta, cúnamh don chomhlacht seo don chéad uair chomh fada siar le 1964. Íocadh breis is €1.59 milliún i ndeontais leis an chomhlacht sa tréimhse ó shin go dáta. D'éirigh go han-mahith leis an ghnó thar na blianta faor úinéirí éagsúla agus cuireadh fostaíocht mhór ar fáil ar eastát tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair ar feadh na mblianta.Bhí deacrachtaí ag an ngrúpa, áfach, le cúpla bliain anuas agus chinn bainistíocht an chomhlachta an monarchan i gCaisleán an Chomair a dhúnadh roimh Nollaig 2002 chomh maith le fostaithe sa mhonarchan i nGaoth Dóbhair a chur ar am gearr.Pléadh na féidearthachtaí uilig, athstructúrú a dhéanamh ar an gcomhlacht agus rátaí pá íslithe san áireamh, roinnt míonna ó shin leis an bhfoireann. Ba léir, áfach, go raibh brú mór leanúnach ar an gcomhlacht, go háirithe mar gheall ar an earnáil atá i gceist – déantús i snátha mustairthe.Tuigim on bpreasráiteas a chuir an glacadóir ar fáil go raibh cainteanna ar bun maidir le leanacht i mbun tradála agus go n-oibreodh seisean leis an mbainistíocht ar mheastóireacht inmharthanach don ghnó.Bhí feidhmeannas an údaráis i dteagmháil cheana féin leis an nglacadóir agus bhí siad i mbun comhráite leanúnacha lena chéile. Déanadh an t-údarás a dhícheall d'fhonn a chinntiú go mbainfear an oiread agus is féidir amach ó thaobh fostaíochta sa ngnó i nGaoth Dobhair agus tá féidearthachtaí faoin ghnó nó cuid de a shábháilt faoi úinéireacht nua á meas.An stad reatha ná go bhfuil an gnó le leanacht ar bhonn am gearr go dtí na laethanta saoire i gceann roinnt seachtainí, agus tá an glacadóir chun an gnó a fhogairt ar díol mar ghnóthas leantach.Mar a dúirt mé le linn an Athló sa Dáil coicís ó shin, is cúis imní dom féin agus d'Údarás na Gaeltachta postanna a bheith á gcailliúint in aon tionscal Gaeltachta, agus go háirithe i nGaoth Dobhair, áit atá buailte go dona le cúpla bliain anuas.Mar atá aitheanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, tá gá le cur chuige nuálach straitéiseach chun cruthú agus caomhnú fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht a threisiú, mar aisfhreagra ar na hathruithe atá ag tarlú san eacnamaíocht domhanda agus náisiúnta. Caithfear dul i ngleic le dúshláin nua maidir le riachtanais, roghanna agus mianta fostaíochta phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá an cur chuige seo sonraithe sna ráitis chinnbhliana agus sna tuarascálacha bliantúla le tamall anuas, agus go deimhin sna gníomhartha praiticiúla atá tógtha ag an údaras, le tacaíocht mo Roinne.Tá an Teach seo ar an eolas maidir leis na céimeanna atá togtha le deireanaí chun borradh a chur faoi chursaí fostaíochta i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall, mar shampla, an grúpa oibre ar chruthú fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht, coiste gníomhaíochta an údaráis faoin ábhar céanna, agus scéim nua fiontraíocht Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht de chuid an údaráis. Leanfar ar aghaidh mar ábhar práinne leis na céimeanna éagsúla atá riachtanach chun fostaíocht bhuan bhreise a chinntiú do cheantar Ghaoth Dobhair.Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go ndéanfaidh mise gach dícheall gur féidir liom mar Aire tacaíocht a thabhairt don údarás don obair seo mar tuigim, thar aon Ghaeltacht ar bith sa tír, go bhfuil Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill tar éis níos mó buillí a fháil le bliain ná aon cheann eile do na Gaeltachtaí. Is féidir a bheith cinnte go ndéanfaidh mé mo dhícheall faoi sin.The Dáil adjourned at 11.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 July 2003.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The Deputy is referring to a review group on public safety which was established in November 1999. The group comprised representatives from Departments, various agencies and bodies. Its report entitled, A Review of Public Safety in Ireland, was published in December 2000. One of the recommendations of the review group was that an office of public safety regulation should be considered, which would not itself be responsible for public safety issues but would have some form of overseeing role of all the agencies and bodies involved. The review group also proposed that the functioning, appropriateness and continuing need for such an office should be reviewed within a five year period. This in itself questions the need for such an office in the first instance. I am convinced that the establishment of yet another State agency, whose function is merely to oversee public safety matters, is not the right way forward.The group was not in full agreement on its proposal due to issues relating to duplication of existing services and additional cost. Some Department representatives expressed reservations about the need for such an office and the extra burden on State finances. Quite clearly, a clear-cut case has not been made nor a properly defined role set out for the establishment of such an office.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	827	On 20 May 2003, I was informed by the company that, following an extensive review, it was announcing plans for the restructuring of its European operations. One of the outcomes of the review was that the company decided to cease manufacturing at its Dublin plant. However, the company will retain 105 jobs here in sales, distribution and warehousing. The company advised that there would be full consultation with employees in relation to the implementation of its restructuring plans. These plans also include substantial job losses in the UK and Austria.As regards alternative employment for the workers affected, FÁS is making available a wide range of services to the workforce including career counselling, reskilling and suitable training and job placement opportunities. A number of prominent companies in the electronics, internationally traded services and software sectors have established operations in the Tallaght area and are continuing to expand their operations. Recently, Google and Overture, two world renowned high tech companies, decided to locate in the area. A Japanese pharmaceuticals company has begun construction of a new plant in Grangecastle, Clondalkin. This area also has a new biotechnology facility employing 500 people, which is expected to increase to 1,300 over the next few years when the plant reaches full capacity.Enterprise Ireland provided significant financial support to over 60 projects in south County Dublin last year. The agency has also approved funding towards the cost of a new campus innovation centre at the Tallaght Institute of Technology. At micro-enterprise level, the South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides a comprehensive range of supports and training.

The Deputy should note that as the High Court award in this case arose from a civil action by way of a plenary summons, the labour inspectorate of my Department has no role in pursuing this particular aspect of the matter. Labour inspectorate investigations into the employment rights aspect of the case concluded recently. My Department is now preparing the matter for transmission to my legal advisers for advice as to the appropriate next steps.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The new national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, outlines several important initiatives that address the commitment to deepening the partnership process in the workplace. The agreement commits the National Centre for Partnership and Performance to playing an increasing role in supporting the process of extending and deepening partnership and performance in the workplace. The agreement identifies a number of specific projects which are to be carried forward by the centre to address these matters. These include the establishment of a forum on the workplace of the future, a joint project with FÁS to promote a learning culture in organisations and the development and dissemination of best practice in the area of partnership and performance. In this regard, case studies of good practice in the private sector have already been published and further examples will be published in the near future.The National Centre for Partnership and Performance will also develop a national training strategy to assist those involved in organisational change through partnership. Guidelines on the different forms of employee financial involvement will be launched shortly. Work on a project aimed at improving practices and procedures in relation to information and consultation rights in the context of the information and consultation directive is under way. In addition, the centre will promote existing joint partnership training materials as developed by IBEC and ICTU. These projects, which have the full support of the social partners, will make a significant contribution to organisational change and modernisation in the coming years.In addition to initiatives set out in Sustaining Progress, the centre recently launched two important tools to assist organisations in managing change and improving performance in their organisations. These are a competency framework on managing change through partnership and a learning by monitoring system, which includes an interactive website facility to support change through partnership.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	830	I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 103 together.The issue of job creation is a day to day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and is one in which I have no direct function.In the period 2000-03, Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for indigenous companies, supported the establishment of 35 high potential start-ups in locations throughout the BMW region with 12 new high potential start-ups targeted for 2003. To the end of December 2002, Enterprise Ireland approved over €20 million to clients in the BMW region. Enterprise Ireland will continue to work closely with clients in the BMW region in supporting new high potential start-up companies; developing existing businesses to enable them to grow their exports, increase their innovation and improve their competitiveness; developing incubator space such as Webworks, incubation centres in third level colleges, and community enterprise centres. The agency will also continue to facilitate access to capital through the seed and venture programme, a primary focus of which is on new regional funds and funds for new technologies.IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The agency is committed to achieving a target of 50% of all new greenfield jobs in the BMW region over the 2000-03 period. However, achievement of this latter target is heavily dependent on short to medium term developments in the world economy, which can heavily influence overall international flows of mobile investment and infrastructural development in the BMW region.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	831	Integrated product policy is a concept which is designed to improve the environmental performance of products throughout their life cycle, encompassing the design, manufacture, marketing, use, recycling and disposal of products. It aims to reduce resource use, waste generation and the environmental impact of products. My Department is supporting a number of initiatives which will help Irish businesses to introduce integrated product policies. These are primarily undertaken through the environmental policy unit of Enterprise Ireland, which provides a range of environmental services for indigenous Irish business. The principal initiatives, all of which have been financially supported by my Department, are as follows.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	832	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 100 together.The Government gave its approval to formally host the first European Competitiveness Summit in Dublin in January this year. The summit is to take place in October and is being organised by the World Economic Forum with a view to contributing to the European Union's Lisbon strategy. The principal focus of the summit will be in the area of economic competitiveness.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. Regional development has become a significant focus of Government policy in Ireland. I have impressed on IDA Ireland the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment in regional locations.IDA Ireland has assured me its commitment to regional development is stronger than ever now with the national spatial strategy in place. IDA Ireland is determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attractions in each region. For its successful development, each region needs to have clear, competitive reasons companies would wish to locate there rather than elsewhere. The success of our economy during the 1990s and on into this decade means that Ireland is now much less competitive as a location for low wage manufacturing projects. As such Ireland, must now gear itself towards attracting a different type of investor. The focus for the future must be to attract investment requiring high skill levels, that is, as far as possible, innovation rather than production orientated, and that links to an increasingly sophisticated business environment.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	835	I welcome the Health and Safety Authority's annual report for 2002. This report is a well presented record of the work undertaken by the authority during 2002 and provides an opportunity to focus on the specific achievements of the authority and the general advancements being made to improve health and safety standards in all workplaces.The reports shows that 61 persons died from workplace injuries in 2002 and an estimated 26,200 persons suffered work related injuries requiring their absence from work for more than three days. Despite an overall downward trend in the rate of workplace accidents and fatalities such figures serve to remind us that the effort to improve work standards and work practices must be a continuous one.While I am pleased that the authority carried out more inspections and investigations than planned in 2002, I welcome also the fact that a substantial number of cases were taken on summary prosecution to the District Court resulting in 70 convictions and that a number of other cases were taken on indictment to the Circuit Court also resulting in convictions. In a further ten cases jurisdiction was refused by the District Court for service of the book of evidence with a view to these cases being taken on indictment. The taking of cases on indictment and the resultant publicity from the imposition of higher penalties when cases are taken to a higher court contributes greatly to an increase in safety awareness among business practitioners.I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work of the board, management and staff of the authority throughout the year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	836	I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 175 together.On 1 May 2003, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, came into effect. IFSRA has a wide regulatory remit, covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all financial services, including insurance, and the services provided by them.The legislation setting up IFSRA provided for the establishment of a consumer director who will have a clear role in consumer protection, with a strong focus on transparency, competition and choice for the consumer. On the question of introducing new legislation, this is now a matter for the consumer director of IFSRA, who has now been appointed, as I no longer have responsibility for legislation relating to the issues to which the Deputy refers.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	837	I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 133 together.On 27 May 2003 the Government approved the priority drafting and publication of the general scheme of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill. It is intended to introduce the published Bill into the Houses of the Oireachtas in the autumn and to enact it by year end, allowing the personal injuries assessment board to be up and running early in 2004.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	838	I consider the issues of access to medicines and special and differential investment to be two of the most important issues to be dealt with at the upcoming meeting of WTO Ministers in Cancún. Agreement in relation to access to medicines is very close and, with a positive approach, it will be possible to reach satisfactory agreement on the issue.On special and differential treatment, a major effort is required to ensure that the commitments entered into in the Doha development agenda are addressed. There is a large number of proposals under consideration and these need to be addressed in a systematic way in order to see where early agreement can be reached. In so far as investment is concerned, I support the European Union proposal that negotiations should be started within the WTO towards the establishment of a multilateral agreement on investment.Foreign direct investment is a key means, among others, to promote development and economic and social growth in developing countries. International rules on FDI would contribute to improving the enabling environment of many countries by increasing legal certainty for investors and by reducing the perception of risk to invest, particularly in developing countries. Any multilateral framework must of course fully recognise and respect the right to regulate of home and host countries.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	839	I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 180 together.There are currently provisions being made for the Article 133 Titulaires Trade Committee and the General Affairs and External Relations Ministerial Council of the EU to sit in continuous session in Cancún during the course of the WTO ministerial meeting. These arrangements are being made in order that the EU can consider each negotiating item and proposal as they arise in the ministerial meeting, and reach a common position during the negotiations. The overall EU negotiating mandate for these negotiations remains as agreed prior to the fourth WTO ministerial meeting in Doha in November 2001.With regard to the Irish position in relation to the negotiations, I refer Deputy Upton to the debate in this Chamber on Friday, 27 June, where the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for development issues, Deputy Kitt, and myself outlined the Irish positions in relation to the issues currently involved in the Doha development agenda negotiations and which will be discussed at the ministerial meeting in Cancún in September.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	840	There are 35 city and county enterprise boards located throughout the country, of which 13 are located in the Border, midlands and west region and 22 in the south and east region. The boards employ a total of 145 full-time staff and were established in October 1993 as companies limited by guarantee to provide a new source of support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer. Section 10 of the Industrial Development Act 1995 gave them formal statutory recognition. The boards provide a single point of contact at local level and complement the activities of other industrial development agencies.The annual budget for the operation of the city and county enterprise boards for 2003 stands at €31 million. For the period 2000-06, the boards form part of the local enterprise development sub-programme of the Border, midlands and western and the southern and eastern operational programmes of the national development plan.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	841	I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 108 together.I understand that the liquidation is progressing in an orderly and efficient manner, though it is likely to take some time to complete the process. Unfortunately, efforts by the liquidator to sell all or part of the assets of the company on a going concern basis were unsuccessful and the liquidator is now proceeding with the realisation of the assets in a manner which seeks to maximise the cash available for creditors.At this stage, I understand that partial payments have been made to the secured creditors. In addition, some preferential claims relating to holiday pay entitlements were paid recently while it is expected that some further payments in respect of preferential creditors, including minimum notice claims and unpaid pensions contributions, will be made in the near future. The liquidator hopes to be able to make an interim payment to the unsecured creditors within about 12 months. I do not expect that the State will receive any payment in respect of its shareholding in the company.All applications received from employees for payments from the ex-gratia fund of €24.5 million, established by ICI and the State, have been processed. Payments from the fund were made by the trustee of the fund in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by him following consultations with employee representatives.

Details of the directives, including, in so far as it has been decided, the proposed transposition instruments, are available on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives. The website also contains information on directives in respect of which infringement proceedings have been commenced.A reasoned opinion has been issued in the case of one of the outstanding directives for which the deadline for implementation has passed. I am satisfied that my Department is giving all due priority to the task of implementing the provisions of EU directives, in light of the available resources.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	843	The reason for the decline in labour inspectorate workplace inspections during the first four months of 2003 relates to demands placed on labour inspectorate staff arising from the implementation of a new computer system.In 2001, as part of a continuing process to strengthen and modernise employment rights enforcement a major business process re-engineering exercise took place in the employment rights unit of my Department, including the labour inspectorate. That exercise produced a variety of recommendations, including one to replace the existing computer system. Following a lengthy tendering process, due to the high level of responses from interested parties, work on the development of a new system commenced at the end of August 2002.Following initial technical development the first prototype appeared in January 2003. As development progressed and greater functionality was added, including modules with direct implications for inspectors' working procedures, the testing regime inevitably became more complex and substantial. In particular, during the months of March, April and May, the development phase was at its most intense and in parallel with this development curve all inspectors and administrative staff were committed almost exclusively to the testing exercise. This level of commitment eased as the final release drew near and the system was formally launched on time on June 17.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	844	My Department has received a copy of the survey from the company in question and has noted its contents. The report makes specific reference to the recent increase in statutory redundancy payments pursuant to the Redundancy Payments Act 2003. It states that "on 25 May 2003, the Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced an amendment to the law in Ireland, providing for two weeks' statutory redundancy pay for every year of service regardless of age". It then gives comparative data concerning severance or redundancy pay in EU countries and in Japan, India and China.Taking a typical example of a 40 year old white-collar employee made redundant after ten years' service on a salary of €30,000, it shows that Irish redundancy payments, while being less than those of Spain, Italy and Austria, are substantially greater than those of France, the UK, Luxembourg and Portugal. While it is true that when the monetary equivalent of the minimum notice period is added to the minimum level of severance – redundancy – payment, Ireland ranks below the EU average, the report acknowledges the recent substantial increase in statutory redundancy in Ireland.Compared to the rates applicable before the Redundancy Payments Act 2003, the new, enhanced rates quadruple statutory redundancy payments in respect of service under the age of 41, up from one-half of a week to two weeks pay per year, and they double statutory redundancy payments in respect of service over the age of 41, up from one weeks to two weeks pay per year. These large increases received a warm welcome from employee representatives. I have, therefore, no plans to further increase the rates of statutory redundancy.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	845	The work permit system grants the permit to an employer to recruit a specific employee to fill a specific vacancy where the employer has been unable to find a suitable employee within Ireland or the wider European economic area. Work permit personnel may in certain circumstances change jobs. In such circumstances a new work permit is issued to an eligible employer. If a work permit were to be given to an individual employee, this in effect, would be granting an authorisation to come to Ireland in search of an employer. Such a system would give rise to a number of serious policy questions and would raise very significant resource issues.Employment rights legislation in Ireland establishes the minimum statutory rights and protections applicable to all 1.7 million people working in Ireland, whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, national or non-national. Employment rights legislation makes no distinction between the rights of immigrant workers and any other workers. All workers in Ireland, without exception, are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections so the protections of Irish labour law apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as to native Irish workers.The labour inspectorate of my Department has an ongoing responsibility for monitoring certain employment rights of workers, including immigrant workers. In this regard the inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.

No. 639 of 2002 – are based on European Directive 98/6/EC, which requires pricing of products to be indicated in a clear and unambiguous manner. The regulations allow for retailers and supermarkets to price goods individually or to use shelf stickers, wall charts, notices or catalogues. The essential obligation on retailers is to provide pricing which is clear and unambiguous. However, it is up to the retailers to decide which method to use. In practical terms, most shops now have scanning facilities and as a result prices are usually on shelf stickers and less often on the products themselves.

The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum. Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement or a lower hourly working week between themselves if they so wish.I have no plans currently to increase the statutory minimum annual leave or public holiday entitlement nor to lower the threshold on weekly working hours provided for in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

The group comprised representatives from IBEC, the ICTU and various Departments and agencies and was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. It recommended a voluntary set of procedures and an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act 1946 to provide a new dispute settling power for the Labour Court. These recommendations were implemented through Statutory Instrument No. 145 of 2000 – the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000 – and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.During the negotiations between the Government and the social partners on the new partnership programme, Sustaining Progress, the need to enhance the effectiveness of these procedures was agreed.A number of measures, which will result in significant improvements to the existing procedures, will be put in place. These measures include the introduction of an overall timeframe targeting 26 weeks for processing cases under the code and the Act, with provision for a maximum of 34 weeks, where necessary. Effect will be given to these measures through amendments to the code and to the Act.

Enterprise Ireland does not have a property remit, however, it supports the development of community enterprise centres, incubation centres in third level colleges and Webworks, which involves the provision of high-class office facilities and a management structure for technology-based companies. Shannon Development is responsible for both the attraction of foreign direct investment and indigenous enterprise development in the Shannon free zone and for indigenous enterprise development in the remainder of the Shannon region. It maintains a property portfolio to advance these objectives. The management of these property portfolios are day to day operational matters for the agencies and not matters in which I have a function.IDA Ireland has a long-standing policy of master planning its business and technology parks to comply with the highest planning and environmental standards.

I regret that it was not possible for the Council of Ministers, notwithstanding the constructive efforts made by the Greek Presidency, to arrive at a balanced compromise solution, which could be agreed by all member states on 3 June.There is continuing disagreement surrounding three issues: the concept of a qualifying period which would apply before temporary agency workers would secure basic pay parity and equivalent conditions to those of the permanent employees in the enterprises to which they are assigned; the duration of such a qualifying period and whether it should be time-limited or transitional in character; and whether the provisions for the protection of the temporary agency workers should be complemented by the prohibition of restrictions or prohibitions on agency work which do not have the protection of agency workers and health and safety as their objective.The European Commission's proposal would have allowed the temporary agency businesses a six-week qualifying period before temporary agency workers assigned to a user enterprise would qualify for the same terms and conditions as permanent employees. The concept of such a qualifying period is opposed by 11 member states. Ireland, together with three other countries, has been seeking to secure a significant lengthening of a qualifying period originally proposed by the Commission. An extended qualifying period is essential to enable companies develop the job performance of temporary agency workers and acquire the on-the-job training and experience required to be legitimately compared with permanent full-time employees.Ireland has consistently sought to secure a flexible framework, which would enable member states to transpose the equal treatment provisions in a manner consistent with promoting job creation and making temporary agency work more attractive, while taking into account the varying labour market conditions pertaining to the different member states. The social partner organisations were consulted on the Commission's proposal and are fully aware of the position taken by Ireland on this measure.The responsibility now rests with the Italian Presidency to move the proposed directive forward. The Irish Government will continue to play a positive role in ensuring that a satisfactory outcome is achieved to reflect the concerns of the various interested parties in Ireland.

The company has stated that it will be seeking 90 voluntary redundancies from its permanent staff. Flextronics is also laying off 110 temporary staff as part of its cyclical temporary staff adjustment. This will bring the total workforce in Flextronics, Cork, to about 900.I understand that the decision by the company follows a period of extreme price pressure on some of its electronics assembly business for a major client. This business will now transfer to competing lower-cost contract manufacturers in Thailand.FÁS, the national training authority, has already been in contact with company representatives to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. It has offered to make available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. It will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market. In addition, Enterprise Ireland and the Cork city and county enterprise boards will provide advice and support to workers interested in setting up their own business.Ireland's recent economic success has changed its profile as a location for new investment. Future investment will require more advanced skills in high value-added activities, often connected with research activity, such as software development and IC design.

The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October last comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Key initiatives in the reform programme include: implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe – to date, 15 of the recommendations have been implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the others; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB – the Government has recently approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing. It is hoped to enact the legislation by the end of the year; my Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market – the study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace and it is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of other measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents and to reform the law on personal injury.While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms being undertaken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses.

It should be noted that the report studied the inflation figures to year-end January 2003, when the annual inflation rate was 4.8%. The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office for May show a sharp fall in inflation to 3.7%, down from 4.3% in April 2003.Notwithstanding this welcome downward trend, the Taoiseach and I have clearly indicated that the Government's target is to get inflation down to 2%. An anti-inflation group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, has been convened under the new national agreement Sustaining Progress and will draw up and monitor progress on a detailed action plan on inflation. One of my officials is actively participating on this group, which has met three times and is due to meet shortly.I am committed to bringing about more competitive pricing across the economy by facilitating increased competition. To this end, I have strengthened the powers of the Competition Authority to investigate price fixing and other anti-competitive practices. I support the work of the authority in conducting extensive examinations of the insurance and banking industries as well as many professional services, including the legal and medical professions.Further, in order for competition to be effective, I am aware that consumers must be given sufficient information to enable them to compare prices. In this regard, I introduced new price display regulations this spring – European Communities (Requirement to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, S.I. No. 639 of 2002 – which clarify and underline the obligations of retailers and other traders to display legible and transparent information on prices to consumers.I also see a key role for the consumer lobby in Ireland. I urge consumers to raise concerns they have regarding prices directly with retailers and suppliers and to be prepared to be assertive in shopping elsewhere if they are unhappy with the prices they are paying. To assist the consumer lobby, as provided in the 2001 budget, I oversee payment of an Exchequer grant of €63,000 per annum to the Consumers Association of Ireland, CAI. The purpose of this grant is to enhance the capacity of the association to act as a consumer watchdog, an advisory body and to represent consumers.

In respect of three of these, the High Court appointed, on an application by me, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.Section 8 inquiries into the affairs of National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are continuing. I understand that the final report is likely to be submitted to the High Court towards the end of 2003. One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the DPP.Eleven investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, as has a further report which was completed recently.Three investigations under section 19 are ongoing. The report in respect of one of these investigations is at a very advanced stage. Two investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this has been referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.

Over the years, its remit has evolved to include a unique mixture of both industrial development and tourism development. Its geographical area of responsibility covers the mid-west region, particularly the counties of Clare and Limerick, as well as parts of counties Offaly, Tipperary and north Kerry.In so far as my area of responsibility – enterprise policy – is concerned, Shannon Development has exclusive statutory responsibility for enterprise development in the area known as the Shannon free zone, a clearly defined area which is set out in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Acts. No other agency operates in this zone.In the area of attracting foreign direct investment for the remainder of the mid-west region, IDA Ireland has sole responsibility. Shannon Development does not have a role in this context. The policy adopted by IDA Ireland in the mid-west region mirrors its operations throughout the rest of the country, thus ensuring a common basis for attraction of FDI.

The speed with which Irish companies adapt to the challenges and opportunities of e-Business will help to determine both their future prospects and the wider economic competitiveness of the country. My Department has provided support of €14 million, for specific initiatives over the last three years to encourage greater awareness and engagement by SMEs with e-business. These include the Enterprise Ireland acceleration fund, the county enterprise boards empower initiative, the chambers of commerce e-Business initiative and the ISC/IBEC eCommerce and SME masterclass awareness campaigns.Funding is available this year for the e-Bit initiative launched by Enterprise Ireland on 19 May. Details of this initiative to prepare SMEs to take full advantage of the opportunities that e-Business can provide are available on the Enterprise Ireland website at www.enterprise-ireland.com.htm. Support is also being provided to the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland this year for a programme to provide training and advice to SMEs to help them prepare for and take advantage of the opportunities afforded by e-procurement.My Department is continuing to develop the range of services it provides electronically, including work permits and both Patents Office and Companies Registration Office services. The BASIS, business access to State information services, project is an ongoing cross-departmental e-government initiative managed by my Department. It aims to provide an Internet-based one-stop shop for information that is relevant to the business community such as information on starting a business, environmental requirements and employing staff.The development of a supportive legal and regulatory framework is critical for building consumer and business confidence in purchasing and supplying information society services. Last February I made regulations to give effect in Ireland to the provisions of the electronic commerce directive. These regulations provide for the free movement of information society services within the European economic area. They also contain important obligations in respect of service providers as well as essential protection for consumers of such services. My Department has also reached agreement since then with the Irish Direct Marketing Association that its members will identify unsolicited commercial communications by e-mail, sometimes referred to as "spam", as such to its recipients.Rapid development in our research and development based technological progress, commercialisation of publicly-funded research and innovation are key contributors to our successful development as an information society. Important progress is now under way. Science Foundation Ireland is now funding research projects with a combined financial commitment of €155 million over five years. Key investments are under way across basic and applied research activities and innovation support aimed at building research and development capability and capacity in industry, including collaboration between industry and the third level sector.

In this regard my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has announced a series of initiatives over recent months aimed at addressing broadband infrastructure deficits and the pricing and availability of Internet access, including broadband. These include the introduction of flat rate Internet access, the halving of DSL installation and rental rates and the ongoing rollout of regional broadband in key provincial centres.The availability of adequate and affordable broadband services throughout the country is increasingly important to our competitiveness in developing ICT based industries; attracting and retaining foreign direct investment and ensuring balanced regional development.Given the relatively low density of population in Ireland and that retaining existing and developing new firms in such isolated areas is of particular importance, satellite and radio can also make contributions as broadband delivery platforms, in addition to cable-based investment. The present publicly supported rollout includes important pilot exercises to establish solutions in this regard for Irish circumstances. The net objective in any event must be that wherever firms are located in Ireland, they should be able to access the competitive benefits of broadband using the most appropriate and cost-effective technology possible.

All construction sites are subject to the provisions of occupational health and safety legislation. However, the high level of deaths and serious accidents in the construction sector remains a matter of serious concern. Progress to improve standards in the sector has been made in recent years through the Construction Safety Partnership, CSP. The CSP is a tripartite forum made up of all the main players including the social partners and the Health and Safety Authority. There has been good progress to date in the implementation and advancement of the recommendations contained in the construction safety plan, especially in relation to the development of the legislative amendments, the introduction of mandatory safety training and mandatory safety representation as well as other measures on safety consultation and safety management systems.While progress has been made in recent years, the challenge remains to maintain and improve upon this progress. The construction-related fatalities in 2002 are testament to the fact that health and safety in the construction sector can still be literally a life and death issue. There is an ongoing need for action at all levels whether this is action by the State, the social partners or by individuals at site level. In this regard, ways in which to continue and to build upon the work of the partnership are being further explored and a new partnership plan for the years 2003 to 2005 is currently being finalised. In addition, proposals for enhanced construction safety regulations are currently being developed by the Health and Safety Authority.

The company paid them their statutory redundancy lump sum entitlements plus some extra statutory amounts. My Department has repaid the company its entitlement to a 60% rebate of the statutory amount.I understand that the workers and their representatives are now making the case that they lost out on payment of the new enhanced statutory redundancy lump sum by virtue of the fact that the new Redundancy Payments Act 2003 was not backdated. The clear legal advice to me from the Office of the Attorney General is that it is not legally allowable to place a retrospective requirement on employers to make additional enhanced payments. In this particular case the workers were made redundant and paid their entitlements towards the end of last year and early this year but the new enhanced redundancy rates were subsequently agreed with the social partners and given legislative effect by the Oireachtas with effect from 25 May last, when I signed the required commencement order.The Deputy is now asking me to consider making ex gratia payments to the workers. There are many thousands of workers in similar circumstances. The questions I have to consider as Tánaiste and Minister with responsibility in this area are if I could make the statutory payments retrospective, how far back would be reasonable; the huge additional cost imposition on either the Exchequer or the social insurance fund; and what would be fair and reasonable in all circumstances. My only conclusion, although unfortunate for the workers concerned, is that retrospective or ex gratia payments are not justified.

As part of the expansion the company agreed with IDA Ireland that up to 80 of the new jobs created would be located in Birr, County Offaly, in addition to the key Limerick facility.IDA Ireland has informed me that due to the current economic climate, and particularly that in the e-learning field, NETg has had to postpone its expansion plans. In December 2002, the company downsized by 50 employees, bringing its current employment to 193. NETg's operations in Limerick has stabilised with this rationalisation. IDA Ireland has indicated that the company is comfortable that it will be able to proceed with its expansion at a later date. To date NETg has not started up operations in Birr.On the 18 April 2002 I also announced that Churchill Insurance Group plc, the fifth largest general insurance company in the UK, was to start up and create 600 new jobs over the next five years in Galway.By November 2002, the date of the latest Forfás annual employment survey, 122 new jobs had been created. Job creation figures for 2003 will not be available until November 2003, the date of the next Forfás annual employment survey.The number of jobs quoted in announcements frequently refer to the number of jobs, which a company expects to create over a number of years. Only a small number of jobs announced in any given year would normally be expected to be created by November of the same year – the date of the Forfás Employment Survey – as there is usually a time lag between the announcement of new jobs and the creation of those jobs. Factors, which influence this time lag, are the time taken to: locate and acquire a suitable site for the companies' operations; construction of the facility and installation of plant and machinery – in the case of manufacturing plants; and recruit and train staff.I am confident that the strategies and policies pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the continuing commitment of the Government to enterprise attraction, growth and development will ensure that Ireland remains a competitive location for FDI.

The agency actively participates on and supports the Listowel Development Group, an initiative which brings together all of the resources relevant to the promotion of Listowel and includes the key development agencies for the region, together with representatives of local industry.IDA Ireland has designated Listowel as a priority town in the mid-west region and the agency is committed to securing a new project for the town. The agency is aiming to attract a project from a complete range of IDA Ireland target sectors in either manufacturing or internationally traded services. I officiated at the sod-turning ceremony for the 16,600 sq. ft. facility in September 1999 in Listowel, which was completed in September 2000.Since its inception, IDA Ireland has been actively marketing the BES building in Listowel through its property division and its network of overseas offices. There have been a number of visits by overseas companies to the building, as well as viewings by members of the agency's international services division who have also met the promoters of the building. While these efforts have not yet resulted in securing a suitable inward investment project, IDA Ireland is continuing to actively market the BES facility and Listowel to potential clients. However, it is the client who makes the final decision on where any project will locate.At present, we are facing slow growth in the world economy with considerable political and economic uncertainties. This makes it all the more difficult to attract foreign direct investment. However, IDA Ireland strategies have proved very successful to date, even in the most difficult of times. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in north Kerry, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the people of Listowel.

The focus of this investigation is to determine whether the goods were being transported in accordance with the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 2001.The transport of dangerous goods by road is regulated by the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 2001 (S.I. 492 of 2001), made under the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act 1998. These regulations apply to the carriage, both in bulk and in packages, of dangerous goods by road, including the loading and unloading of the dangerous goods in relation to their carriage. They give effect to a UN convention, the ADR international agreement on the transport of dangerous goods by road as well as relevant EU directives. The regulations set out a comprehensive framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by road.The regulations impose duties on the consignor and on the carrier of the dangerous goods and also on the driver of the vehicle carrying the goods. They contain requirements for the vehicles, tanks, tank containers, receptacles and packages containing the dangerous goods during their carriage. They require that the drivers and others, involved in the carriage of the dangerous goods by road, including their loading and unloading, be adequately trained and, in the case of drivers, hold certificates of such training.As the investigation into this incident has not been completed, I cannot comment further on the particulars of this case or speculate on possible factors or on any possible action that may be necessary pending the outcome of that investigation.However, proposals being developed by the Health and Safety Authority for new regulations to replace the 2001 regulations are at an advanced stage. The new regulations will implement the 2003 edition of the ADR international agreement on the transport of dangerous goods by road as required by European Commission Directive 2003/28/EC. The authority has held extensive consultation on the new legislative proposals with representatives of industry, trades unions, Departments, State agencies, dangerous goods safety advisers, approved ADR driver training providers and the statutory dangerous substances advisory committee.

In relation to my own Department, the e-Cabinet project was announced in February 2002. The e-Cabinet project will deploy information society technologies in support of the Cabinet process to facilitate greater efficiencies in the operation of Cabinet.A feasibility study concluded by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers, published in February 2002, recommended proceeding with the project. The study gave an indicative estimate of cost of the order of €3.4 million, exclusive of VAT, for the central Cabinet secretariat element of the project, with additional costs liable to be incurred, for example, in developing an appropriate security architecture and in implementation of the project in individual Departments. The study drew attention to the fact that features of the system can be used to support a range of other Government initiatives.The project is at an advanced stage and present indications are that it may be delivered significantly below those projected costs.

Suitability can only be gauged by reference to the subject matter of the tribunal or inquiry.The Attorney General does not have a list of barristers from which legal teams for tribunals are chosen. The Attorney General does not set levels of fees for legal teams or representation serving any tribunal, inquiry or public investigation under the aegis of the State. He does, however, recommend levels of fees. This recommendation is subject to the sanction of fees by both the Department setting up, or represented before, the inquiry or public investigation out of whose Vote payment of such fees will be made and by the Department of Finance.The level of fees for the Moriarty tribunal which comes under the aegis of my Department are: senior counsel €2,500 per diem; junior counsel, €2,000 per diem. Frank Clarke SC was paid the sum of £3,540 in 1999 for representing the public interest at the Moriarty tribunal. These fees were reviewed in May and June 2002 after a period of five years.I have already outlined to the Deputy in my reply of 17 June the names of members appointed to, and the moneys paid to the legal teams of the Moriarty tribunal for which my Department has responsibility. I understand that the Deputy has received replies from all relevant Departments to the same question on that date.

Negotiations on grants or on the management of IDA's industrial property portfolio are day-to-day operational matters for the agency and not matters in which I have a function. IDA Ireland has informed me that it is actively marketing and promoting the facility at Athy through its network of overseas offices and is highlighting its competitive rental rate in comparison to locations like Dublin, etc. Enterprise Ireland is also actively promoting the facility as a location for business and to support enterprise in the Athy area.Over the past 12 months, IDA Ireland completed three site visits to the facility, one of which was a recent repeat. That investor is still considering Athy but has to secure a contractual supply agreement with local multinationals before it could submit a business plan and proposal to IDA. This process could take up to six months.In the meantime the disposal of the Athy facility remains a priority for IDA Ireland. It is the only IDA advance factory being marketed in the mid-east region and the agency informs me that no other advance factory will be constructed until this facility is occupied.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies in the county, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable jobs for the people of County Kildare.

Information from the survey should provide a useful guide for future policy. I expect that final information from the survey will be available to my Department in the autumn.Last year I made the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 to implement Directive 2000/35/EEC of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating late payment in commercial transactions. The regulations came into operation on 7 August 2002 and apply to all commercial transactions in the public and private sectors. They provide that interest shall be payable in respect of the late payment of a commercial debt. A payment is regarded as late if it has not been paid 30 days after an invoice or goods have been received or by a date as agreed by contract. The regulations also provide that compensation may be claimed for debt recovery costs.It is generally accepted that the payment practices of public sector bodies improved after the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 came into operation in January 1998. Sections 4 to 11 of that Act were repealed when the EU directive on combating late payment was implemented. Payment practices in the public as well as the private sector are now covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002.

Progress in respect of each of these indicators will be detailed in my Department's forthcoming annual reports.My Department has agreed, in accordance with the terms of the PPF, a range of specific and measurable performance indicators for public service modernisation in the context of the strategic management initiative over the period April 2001 to April 2002. A detailed progress report was submitted in May 2002 to the Civil Service quality assurance group established under the PPF. The report outlined progress on the overall strategic management framework, enhancement of partnership, organisational flexibility, capability and policy analysis, quality customer service and e-public services and internal issues such as human resource and performance management, training, equality and financial and IT management. My Department is currently preparing an action plan under Sustaining Progress in which it outlines specific actions it will implement in order to advance the modernisation agenda within the Department over the duration of the partnership agreement. It is based on a number of themes outlined in the social partnership document. This action plan has been endorsed by the Department's partnership committee. Progress on these actions will be reported periodically to the Civil Service performance verification group.

It is the Department's policy to process work permit applications in the order in which they are received. Assuming the application is completed correctly and is otherwise in order it is likely to be processed within the next five weeks. The Department is now issuing work permits at a rate of about 1,000 per week.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	900	I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 173 together.EUREKA is a Europe-wide, non-bureaucratic network promoting market-driven research and development projects in all fields of advanced technology. Its aim is to strengthen the productivity and worldwide competitiveness of European companies by promoting cross-border co-operation in product, processes and services research and development, aiming at the world market. The EUREKA organisation facilitates collaboration on projects of common interest. It does not provide direct financial support. The level of contribution to specific projects is a matter for the project participants themselves. Consequently my Department does not hold details of participating companies or their financial contribution to the projects in which they are involved.During the years from the start of the programme in 1985 to 2002 a total of 35 Irish companies participated in EUREKA projects. A further 14 projects involving participation by research departments in the university sector and other state institutions were instigated. Seven new Irish collaborations have been registered in EUREKA projects so far this year. Enterprise Ireland is in regular contact with both industry and the third level sector with a view to promoting participation in international collaborative research through the wide variety of programmes in this area.

According to the most recent data – from 2001 – total Government allocations for science and technology activities was €1.76 billion, which represented 1.5% of GDP. A separate volume is also published which illustrates research and development expenditure in the public sector annually. In 2001 this was at €341.8 million, which represents 0.3% of GDP. As the relevant percentage for 2003 will depend on economic performance in the course of the year, it is not possible to provide a definitive figure for 2003 at this time.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	902	At the European Council in Barcelona in 2002, the Heads of Government agreed that overall spending on research and development in the Union should be increased from the current EU average of 1.9%, with the aim of approaching 3% of GDP by 2010, and with two thirds of this new investment coming from the private sector. The target of 3% is for Europe as a whole rather than each individual member state, reflecting the fact that some countries such as Sweden and Finland are already above the 3% figure. The corresponding figure for gross expenditure on research and development in Ireland is currently estimated at 1.2% of GDP.Within the context of the overall European target, it is now necessary to decide an appropriate national target for 2010, taking account of Ireland's industrial structure, current research and development performance and potential. With this in mind, I have established a high-level cross-departmental group to advise on what the appropriate target for Ireland should be. The group has established a number of working groups involving representatives from industry, venture capitalists and representatives from the universities and institutes of technology and Government Departments and agencies to advise on key issues relevant to the establishment of a national target. I expect the overall report of the high level group before the end of the year with a view to deciding on the appropriate national target.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	903	The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions, including wages and salaries for all categories of workers in Ireland. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned. If appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native workers.In 2002 the inspectorate undertook just over 8,300 inspections and visits, mainly dealing with issues arising from more than 1,000 case files, the national minimum wage, the Payment of Wages Act 1991 and employment regulation orders, and ensured the payment of €354,000 in arrears of wages to employees. Some 32 cases were referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for legal proceedings, 25 of these arising from the investigative work of the labour inspectorate. In 2003, the inspectorate has undertaken 1,493 inspections and visits and ensured payment of €107,022 in wage arrears. Seven cases have been referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for legal proceedings, all of these arising from the investigative work of the inspectorate.In addition to the investigative work undertaken by inspectors in 2002, work also commenced on the development of a new case management system to support streamlined work procedures in the labour inspectorate. The new IT system was launched on 17 June this year. It is the result of considerable investment by my Department – approximately €900,000 when completed – and will provide the technological support to enable inspectors to operate more effectively and efficiently in their interactions with employers and employees alike. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting immigrant workers I ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.While rates of deductions for board and lodgings may be provided for under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and through the joint labour committee-registered employment agreement system, accommodation for immigrant workers, or indeed Irish and EU workers, does not come within scope of employment law.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	904	The need for the economy to protect and enhance its competitiveness is a high priority on the Government agenda and is the subject of ongoing discussions with policy makers and the social partners. In the context of maintaining Ireland as an attractive and competitive location for investment, my Department and its agencies are continuously monitoring the position of firms in the manufacturing and services sectors to identify both opportunities for, and threats to, employment.In this regard IDA Ireland is actively looking for new clients to replenish the pool of foreign-owned companies operating in this country. Ireland gains more than we lose from our status as an open economy, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years with any job losses being counteracted by firms choosing this country as a location for certain higher value added business functions. We have been remarkably successful at attracting long-life investments, with a number of foreign-owned companies successfully operating here for more than two decades.There are a number of factors contributing to decisions of firms to relocate all or part of an enterprise – consolidation, merger or acquisition, or changes in product or market focus – in addition to relative wage rates and other costs and available incentives. Ireland both gains and loses from such decisions, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years with losses being counteracted by firms choosing this country as a location for certain higher value added business functions. Recent events internationally indicate that there are significant perils associated with operating in some of these low wage economies, which may impact on decisions to locate in these areas.The strategy in facing the challenge of job losses to lower cost economies is firstly to focus a major part of our efforts on an embedding programme for the existing overseas-owned companies in this country.To facilitate enterprise development, we will continue, through active implementation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to focus on strengthening our research and development capacity, enhancing our skills base, implementing infrastructural improvements, and shaping the regulatory environment for enterprise. These measures will complement the efforts of capable companies to move up the value chain from basic production subsidiaries to strategically valuable nerve centres of their parent multinationals, encouraging these firms to add strategic functions including research and development, technical support, software development, e-commerce, logistics and shared services.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	905	In deciding on the 2003 allocations for FÁS, the Government was conscious of the need to maximise, within the current constraints on public expenditure, investment in measures that have a primary focus on employability. The FÁS budget for 2003 is €814 million. This compares to €860 million in 2002.This decrease is, in the main, reflected in the funding of the community employment programme. This is consistent with the Government's decision to restructure CE, with levels being gradually reduced to reflect the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training.Overall investment in FÁS training programmes in 2003 is being maintained close to 2002 levels with funding of €297 million being made available compared to €301 million in 2002. This will result in some reduction in training places in 2003. FÁS, taking into account policy guidelines, will decide on the priorities between schemes and activities from within this allocation. FÁS will also be required to maximise the benefits to its client base of the available funding through greater efficiencies.

I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. There are indications that motor insurance premia are beginning to reduce.The insurance industry is implementing various recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board through codes of practice. These recommendations relate to improved equality, transparency and information for consumers and businesses.

Under these regulations, an individual may be entitled to full pay up to a maximum of six months in one year and half pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of 12 months' sick leave in any period of four years or less.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	913	My Department actively supports the promotion of local food economies and farmers markets through a number of avenues. As part of its statutory remit for the promotion and market development of Irish food and drink, An Bord Bia is working with small food producers to develop this route to market. The scope for development of farmer markets has been identified in the speciality-artisan food sector, which currently has sales estimated at €450 million.In 2002, An Bord Bia staged Ireland's largest ever outdoor food market based on the farmers market style at the International Food Symposium in Kinsale. More than 110 small food producers marketed and sold their produce to more than 200 national and international buyers and to the general public. An Bord Bia also provides general advice and information to people who have an active interest in setting up farmers markets in urban and rural areas.The report of the organic development committee, which I established on foot of a recommendation of the agri-food 2010 committee, recognised the importance of farmer co-operatives and producer groups in developing the organic sector. The committee recommended the establishment of an organic market development group. My Department is participating in the work of this group, which is chaired by An Bord Bia and has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food. I expect that the group will further explore the potential of farmers' markets as an outlet for organic produce.Aid is also available to producer organisations meeting the conditions of Council Regulation 2200/96 in respect of operational programmes run by them. The aid is determined by the turnover of the group as a whole. There are currently 17 producer organisations in the fruit and vegetables sector receiving payments of approximately €3 million annually.My Department also provides limited financial assistance to the Irish Countrywomen's Association for work performed by Country Markets Ltd., in developing co-operative markets for the sale of farm, garden and home produce in rural areas.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	915	I am aware of the views expressed by Compassion in World Farming on a range of issues, including fur farming. Where my Department is made aware of allegations of breaches of regulations, the matter is investigated and appropriate action is taken.Fur farming is a legitimate farming activity in this country. Under the Musk Rats Act 1933, (Application to Mink) Order 1965, the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence from my Department. Licences are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection carried out by officials from my Department, is found to be compliant with a number of key conditions.Licensed fur farms are also inspected by my Department to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have found that the licensed fur farms have been operating in compliance with current legislation. Inspections have also found that the slaughter methods employed by the licensed fur farms are permitted under the Sixth Schedule of the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations 1995, which gives effect to Council Directive 93/119/EC. My Department will continue to keep in close contact with the fur industry and to monitor the operation of the licensed fur farms.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	923	As a result of an EU-wide ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal, MBM, to farmed animals, which came into effect from the beginning of 2001, MBM was transformed from a commercially valuable product into a waste material with a significant disposal cost. Various subsidies were implemented in member states to facilitate the rendering industry in facing this challenge and to help the animal production and slaughter sectors adapt to the new situation. My Department instituted payments to the rendering sector at the time based on the production of MBM, which payments have been progressively reduced and totally phased out with effect from 31 May 2003. The total amount paid to the rendering sector in Ireland in the period since the feed ban came to €146 million.My Department continues to provide a subsidy towards the cost of storing and disposing of MBM produced prior to December 2003. An amount of approximately 170,000 tonnes of MBM is currently stored in this country pending destruction. The requirement to export MBM for disposal is a cost for the livestock sector which has become more apparent with the cessation of the subsidy. The meat processing sector has sought to reduce the cost of rendering and one of the options explored has been the export of offal to Northern Ireland for rendering and landfill disposal there.The movement of offal, from one member state to another, once taken from animals passed fit for human consumption, is provided for under the new EU animal by-products legislation. It is clear that the subsidy payments have ended that the main advantage to Northern Ireland renderers is the availability to them of lower cost disposal of MBM by means of landfill, rather than any differentiation in subsidy payments. Clearly, the solution to this is to have acceptable disposal outlets for MBM in this country which would help maintain the competitiveness of our livestock sector and limit the dependence on other member states for ongoing disposal of the by-product of our slaughter sector.

Under the European Communities (Milk Quotas) Regulations 2000, the processors are required to test all milk supplies for butterfat content. In all cases, the procedures employed are monitored by my Department.While there is no statutory basis for my Department to carry out protein testing, it conducts regular checks on the calibration of the instruments used in milk processing establishments for measuring the protein content of milk and also random administrative checks to ensure that this result is correctly transcribed into the calculation of the milk price paid to the producer.

It does not affect plants and accordingly does not come within the scope of EU plant health regulations, for which the Department of Agriculture and Food has statutory responsibility. It also falls outside the scope of EU environmental regulations.I am aware that the flatworm has been recorded at several sites in this country in recent years. I am not aware of any research being carried out on this pest. There is no known control method, apart from trapping the flatworms and physically destroying them.While we operate the most stringent plant health controls relating to imported plant material, it is widely accepted that the New Zealand flatworm is not a plant health issue. It is an environmental issue for which there are no practical, enforceable measures in place to prevent its entrance or spread within the EU.

An application was submitted by the person named in respect of this quota and, as he successfully satisfied the conditions of the scheme, an allocation was made in his case.An appeal was subsequently lodged by this applicant but, based on the evidence provided, he was not eligible for a further allocation. The result of this appeal was issued to the appellant on 19 June 2003.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	936	According to the Central Statistics Office, almost 14,000 tonnes of beef was imported into Ireland in 2002 and Ireland exported some 445,000 tonnes in that year. In the retail sector, there is a legal requirement that certain details of origin must be included on labels of such beef. However, there is no statutory requirement on the food service sector. Accordingly, most food service outlets do not inform their customers of the origin of their beef. As a result of concerns expressed by consumers on this and other issues, I established a food labelling group to examine issues surrounding food labelling in general. This group reported to me last December and this specific issue was raised in the context of the group's recommendations.There was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. However, differences were expressed on how origin should be defined. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in this area. I have since established an interdepartmental agency committee to progress the recommendations contained in this report. This committee is comprised of the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; and the Food Safety Promotion Board.The consumer liaison panel has drawn up a strategy for consumer research to establish the concerns of consumers in respect of food labelling generally. This strategy includes the issue of origin. I have provided the funding for the research and the consumer liaison panel has sought tenders for the carrying out of the research, which should begin shortly.

When processing the application, it was found that seven of the animals declared as cows were, in fact, heifers, leaving the number of heifers in excess of the maximum 40% heifer allowance. The herd owner was informed that this could lead to the animals in excess of the 40% being rejected from his claim with consequent penalty if evidence could not be provided to show that the animals were cows at the time of application.The applicant was also informed at this time that a 1% late application penalty would apply to any grants due as his application was lodged after the closing date of 28 June 2002 and he was also requested to provide his PPSN number. The herd owner did not reply and was again contacted on 20 November and 11 December 2002. He replied on 24 December 2002, stating that he had a problem obtaining tags but did not provide any information that would assist in the processing of his claim. Records on the CMMS showed that, during the six-month retention period, some of the heifers calved and the herd owner sold 12 cows and two heifers. He was written to on 27 February 2003 requesting him to nominate suitable replacements for the animals that were sold but he did not reply to this correspondence.The delay in the processing of the application is due to the failure of the person named to provide details as requested. Until such time as these details are provided it will not be possible to process this application further.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	942	Allowable deductions under the tax law relating to rental income are provided for in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Section 97(2)(d) authorises a deduction in respect of "the cost of . . . management of the premises borne by the person chargeable and relating to and constituting an expense of the transaction or transactions under which the rents or receipts were received, not being an expense of a capital nature". I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in strictness, mortgage protection policy premiums are arguably not part of the cost of management of the premises but relate more to the management of the landlord's financial affairs than to the management of the premises. Such expenditure could also be argued to be capital in nature. However, the Revenue Commissioners recognise that financial institutions insist that such policies are put in place when sanctioning borrowings. Accordingly, Revenue, having reviewed the position, decided to treat mortgage protection policy premiums paid as an allowable deduction in computing rental income for income and corporation tax purposes.The new treatment was applied from a current date. Thus, mortgage protection policy premiums paid on or after 1 January 2002 will benefit. It is not possible to apply the new treatment retrospectively as this would involve the reopening of thousands of cases already settled. The approach adopted is in line with that adopted in a similar previous ruling where it was decided that accountancy fees incurred in preparing rental income accounts could also be offset against rental income.

However, if one spouse remains in the family home, there is provision, in certain limited circumstances, to extend the first-time buyer relief to the other spouse, if he or she purchases a home. In such circumstances, a person whose marriage is the subject of a decree of judicial separation, a decree of divorce, a decree of nullity or a deed of separation may be treated as a first-time buyer, provided that the person has no interest in the former marital home and the other spouse continues to occupy it as a main residence. The home must also have been occupied by both of them as their main residence prior to the separation. Stamp duty legislation does not provide for relief in cases of hardship or on compassionate grounds.

However, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the home carer's tax credit, which was an allowance when introduced and is now a credit. I introduced it in the Finance Act 2000 and it is designed to recognise the contribution made by a spouse who remains working in the home in order to care for certain dependent persons who may not be the spouse of the claimant. The dependent person is defined as a child in respect of whom child benefit is being paid, a person aged 65 years or over, or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. This definition includes a person related by marriage to the claimant and a person in respect of whom the claimant is or was the legal guardian. The tax credit currently amounts to €770 per annum.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	948	Three rates of VAT apply to food items: a zero rate; a reduced rate of 13.5%; and a standard rate of 21%. For the purposes of VAT law, confectionery at the standard rate of VAT refers to soft drinks, sweets, chocolates, chocolate biscuits, peanuts, crisps and ice cream. Flour-based and egg-based products such as pastries are subject to the reduced VAT rate. Bread, milk and other basic food products are subject to the zero VAT rate.Under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. As confectionery products were not zero rated before 1991, it is not possible to apply a zero rate of VAT to such products now.Annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive allows for a reduced rate as low as 5% to apply to certain goods and services and this includes food for human consumption. If all the confectionery products currently at the standard rate of VAT were made subject to a reduced rate of VAT of 5%, it would cost the Exchequer in the region of €228 million in a full year. Given the cost to the Exchequer I have no plans to alter the current VAT rates for confectionery products.I am anxious to see employment maintained in all sectors of the economy. The best way to pursue this, in my view, is to keep the tax burden low, as we have done, especially on the direct tax side as this has the greatest effect on stimulating and sustaining employment.

EU VAT rules determine the extent to which goods and services can be reduced rated. It is only possible to introduce reduced rates where they are specifically provided for in existing VAT law. As this is not the case with motorcycle helmets and protective clothing, they continue to be subject to the standard rate of VAT of 21%.

The scheme provides valuable benefits to those severely and permanently disabled persons who qualify under its terms either as driver or passenger. Under the scheme, a new motor vehicle may be purchased every two years free of VAT and vehicle registration tax, subject to certain monetary and engine size limits. In addition, the annual road tax is not charged and the qualifying person is eligible for the provision per annum of 2,728 litres of motor fuel free of excise duty. The relief can be claimed by forwarding a completed Form DD1 to the Central Repayments Office, Freepost, Coolshanagh, County Monaghan, telephone Lo-Call 1890 606061. Form DD1 and a comprehensive information booklet on the scheme have been forwarded to the Deputy. There are also a number of other reliefs which may be of benefit to the carer of a disabled couple or to the couple themselves. Employment of a carer allowance can be claimed where a person, or a spouse or a relative is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity for a tax year and a person is employed to care for the incapacitated person. The allowance applies at an individual's marginal rate of tax for expenses up to €30,000 per annum. Where the cost of employing a carer is shared by family members, the allowance can be shared between them subject to the overall ceiling in any one year. Therefore, the cost of employing a carer can be shared by the incapacitated person and their relatives.Medical expenses relief is available at the individual's marginal tax rate in respect of unreimbursed nursing home, doctors, hospitals and other health expenses. This relief can be claimed in respect of relatives and for other individuals, whether they are relatives or not, who are aged 65 or over or who are permanently incapacitated.A dependent relative credit can be claimed by a person who maintains at their own expense a relative, including a relative of their spouse who is unable, due to old age or infirmity, to maintain himself or herself; or a widowed mother or father of the claimant or of the claimant regardless of the state of her health; or a son or daughter of the claimant who resides with the claimant and on whose services the claimant, by reason of old age or infirmity, is compelled to depend. The value of the dependant relative credit is €60 per annum.

However, it is not my function to manage the funds invested. One of the key principles underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act is the fact that the fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. The commissioners control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy. The Act requires the commission to follow a strictly commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term subject to prudent risk management. In following this mandate, the commission has decided on a long-term asset allocation of 80% equities and 20% bonds.

The Irish Government has no official standing in this matter which is a bilateral consular question between the Cuban and US authorities. It is not my intention to intervene in this matter.Nevertheless, in order to be as helpful as possible when replying in detail to a number of Parliamentary questions on the subject of Cuba on 25 March 2003, I asked my Department to make enquiries with the US authorities, and I gave the Dáil the information provided.Since then, it is our understanding that, in the case of one of the five Cuban citizens, some re-scheduling of client-lawyer meetings arising from administrative issues within the US prison system, contributed, with other factors, to a delay in the preparation of the brief for his appeal. In view of this, and with the co-operation of the United States Attorney's Office, it is understood that the application for an extension of the deadline for the filing of the "initial brief" was accepted by the Court of Appeals. We understand that the brief has now been submitted.

This view was based on the fact that since 1998 Iraq had refused to permit the return of the weapons inspectors with the consequence that they had been unable to fulfil their mandate. Subsequent to this resolution and when faced with the threat of force, Iraq accepted the return of the inspectors. However, the degree of co-operation which Iraq extended to the inspectors was described by them as less than full. The reports of the inspectors made it clear that many questions remained unanswered regarding Iraq's holdings of weapons of mass destruction.The fact that the coalition forces which invaded Iraq, citing as justification the Iraqi regime's refusal to co-operate with UN weapons inspectors, have yet to discover weapons of mass destruction, raises questions as to the motives of the Iraqi regime in refusing to fully co-operate with inspectors.The recent events in Iraq reinforce the need for all states, in the interest of international peace and security, to fully implement resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and to abide by the terms of the UN Charter. Government policy will continue to reflect these fundamental requirements.

The major component is my Department's Vote for international co-operation, €374 million in 2003, while elements of ODA, expected to total some €80 million in 2003, are administered by other Government Departments. Total spending on ODA is therefore expected to reach some €450 million in 2003, the highest ever in the history of the e programme. Current indications are that this will equate to 0.41% of GNP. The level of funding required to reach the 0.7% target will depend on patterns of economic growth and levels of GNP. As regards the projected level of expenditure for 2004, this will be decided later this year in the context of the annual Estimates negotiations.

My own most recent direct discussion of the Colombian conflict with the Colombian foreign minister, Ms Carolina Barco, took place on 28 March last.As the House is aware from my replies to previous questions on this subject, Ms Ingrid Betancourt – a candidate in the 2002 Colombian presidential election – was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, on 23 February 2002. She remains in FARC captivity, along with the former Governor of Meta province, a former Cabinet Minister, 12 regional Deputies, approximately 40 members of the State security forces, and several thousand ordinary Colombian citizens. Three US citizens are also being held captive. I share the general concern for the welfare of these hostages, including that of Ms Betancourt. That concern has increased following the murder by FARC on 5 May last of ten hostages including the Governor of Antioquia province, Dr. Guillermo Gaviria Correa, as well as by the murder last week of two further hostages, the Colombian industrialist, Helmut Bickenbach, and his wife, Doris Gil.Ireland and our EU partners issued a statement condemning the murder of kidnap victims, emphasising that hostage-taking is recognised as an act of terrorism, and calling for the release of all hostages without preconditions.The EU statement also expressed the belief that every effort should be made to restart as soon as possible the search for a humanitarian agreement on the specific hostage question as well as for a negotiated political solution to the overall conflict.As I have previously informed the House, on 31 January 2003, President Uribe established a commission to evaluate the possibility of a humanitarian exchange of hostages held by FARC for terrorist prisoners detained by the State authorities. The three-member commission is composed of Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro, vice-president of the Colombian Episcopal Conference, Mr. Angelino Garzón, former minister for labour, and Father Darío Echeverri, the secretary of the Catholic Conciliation Commission.

The planning group consisted of representatives of the partners in education and the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Finance. Associations representing the interests of psychologists were also represented.

Documentation was received in my Department's offices in Athlone in June 2002 and was assessed and the decision in relation to music was issued to the person in question and to the school authority in August 2002. In December 2002, the person in question appealed the decision. Following a review of all the documentation to hand, the appeal was refused in January 2003. This decision was conveyed to the person in question at the time. In March 2003, my Department invited the person in question to submit more detailed information on his primary degree with a view to a full re-examination of the suitability of this qualification for the teaching of music. Further documentation was received from this person at that time. However, significant personnel changes in the area of the Department which deals with these matters led to some regrettable delay at this point and it was not possible to complete the re-examination until recently. A full decision based on the outcome of this re-examination is being prepared and will issue in the next week. In January 2003 the person in question sought independent assessment of his primary degree for the purpose of teaching Irish at second level. He was referred to the registration council as the appropriate authority for this purpose and the necessary application forms were issued to him. There is no record of the person in question having returned the completed forms.

An application for improved accommodation has been received from the management authorities of St. Brigid's national school. However, my Department does not intend to allow further large-scale projects into architectural planning during 2003. The timing of when individual projects can progress to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress with existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects.

Primary schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in March-April 2000 at the request of my Department. Scoil Phadraig Naofa is included in the urban dimension of this programme and is benefiting from the allocation of supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	970	Giving Children An Even Break was launched to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual "at risk" pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil-teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children An Even Break. The school is benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.

Under the terms of these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to their third level course. Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.Students who are not 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to third level education cannot be assessed as mature students. When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student. The other student support schemes have similar provisions on the means assessment of students. A reduction in the age threshold defining mature student status under my Department's maintenance grants schemes would have to be considered in the light of available financial resources and other competing demands in the education sector. I am aware of the fact that the existing arrangements may cause difficulties in individual circumstances and I have asked my Department to examine the issues involved in the light of representations received in the matter.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	972	My Department funds the maintenance grant scheme in respect of students pursuing post-leaving certificate, PLC courses.On 25 May 2003, I was pleased to announce a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing further education.This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged. The key elements of the package are as follows: increasing grant levels, including maintenance grants for eligible PLC students, by 15%; extending the thresholds and increasing the gradations as follows: €0 to €32,000 for full grant; €32,000 to €34,000 for 75% grant; €34,000 to €36,000 for half grant; and €36,000 to €38,000 for 25% grant; increasing the amount of the top-up grant to the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance – this will benefit eligible grantholders pursuing PLC courses; and extending the threshold for the €670 student service charge from €36,897 to €40,000.I believe that this substantial package of measures will provide an unprecedented opportunity for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system.

PLCs represent one such option, providing integrated general education, vocational training and work experience for young people and adults alike who wish to bridge the gap between school and work or return to education to obtain a qualification. The primary purpose of PLCs is to enhance the prospects of students to gain employment. PLCs also provide an alternative route to entry to higher education in the institutes of technology through the NCVA-FETAC links scheme.The number of students participating on PLC courses has increased incrementally over time, as illustrated in the following table:
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	974	My Department does not have figures available in relation to the number of participants from disadvantaged backgrounds as a percentage of the total number of students in the university, institute of technology and post leaving certificate sectors. In regard to the higher education sector, the most comprehensive figures derive from a series of surveys commissioned by the Higher Education Authority and undertaken by Professor Patrick Clancy. Surveys have been undertaken on new entrants entering full-time higher education in 1980, 1986, 1992 and 1998. The most recent report entitled College Entry in Focus: A Fourth National Survey of Access to Higher Education, is based on a national survey of all first enrolments of undergraduates in their first year of study as full-time higher education students in 43 higher education colleges in autumn 1998. The study is based primarily on an analysis of personal demographic and educational data, which were abstracted from individual student record forms. Being the fourth in a series of national surveys carried out at six-year intervals, this study facilitates an analysis of changes in the pattern of participation over a period of 18 years.The following tables from the latest Clancy report show the estimated proportion of age cohort entering full-time higher education by father's socio-economic group and the rates of admission to higher education in Dublin by postal district.Table 25Estimated proportion of age cohort entering full-time higher education by father's socio-economic group in 1980, 1986, 1992 and 1998

All five schools have been occupied since January 2003. I am actively identifying other possible education PPP projects. However, under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, such as public private partnerships, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance over the construction phase. The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue as will a standing committee established by my colleague the Minister for Finance to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects. Consideration of any new PPP projects will also be based on an evaluation of the completed pilot PPP schools project together with a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes going forward and taking into account the issues surrounding the General Government Balance.

This project is listed in section 11, primary, of the 2003 school building programme. The projects at Howth Road NS, Belgrove boy's NS and the Phoenix Park Special School are in the early stages of architectural planning and are listed in section 7, primary, of the building programme. The timing of when these can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority assigned to each project by reference to the band ratings.On the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to make provision for the acquisition of a site for Gaelscoil Cholmcille in 2003. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects, including site acquisitions, that could not be included in this year's programme.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	979	For the purposes of my Department's maintenance grants schemes, reckonable income means all amounts, with the exception of defined social welfare and health board payments, received or receivable by an individual without reference to his/her residence or domicile, from both Irish and foreign sources, which are liable to Irish income tax, Irish capital gains tax or Irish capital acquisitions tax, or which would be so liable but for exemptions and reliefs contained in Irish legislation. The intent of this definition is to ensure that all types of income will be included in determining a person's income for grant purposes. For the purposes of determining grant eligibility, all investments must be declared, including deposit accounts, savings certificates, life assurance bonds and other financial instruments where the interest-profit is accumulated and paid out as a lump sum at the end of the investment period.Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income. Where income is not paid out annually but is "rolled-up" and paid out with the original investment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the "rolled-up" income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment. This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.Given its similarity with "roll-up" savings products it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs on an annual basis. The treatment of the SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as post office savings certificates.My Department is satisfied that the approach taken to computing reckonable income for purposes of determining eligibility under the maintenance grant schemes is appropriate.

My Department has estimated that a total of €1.5 billion is required over the next number of years to address the capital needs in the primary education sector. I am pleased to advise the House that, in line with the concept outlined in the Agreed Programme for Government for a multi-annual schools modernisation fund, I am in ongoing discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to secure a four to five-year funding envelope for the schools building programme. My Department will continue to use the contingency fund in the programme to cover urgently required accommodation, health and safety works and other urgent works which arise during the course of the normal primary school year.The 2003 school building programme was updated on the Department's website in May to reflect allocations from the contingency sum. This update included details in respect of urgently required temporary classroom accommodation and a new pilot initiative aimed at facilitating primary schools wishing to put a permanent solution in place to meet their immediate classroom accommodation needs.

However, in light of the proposed additional housing in the area, my Department will continue to monitor developments and any needs identified will be addressed by increasing existing school capacity, or through new school provision, as appropriate.

This school opened in September 2000 and was planned to cater for a long-term enrolment of 650 pupils. Prior to arriving at a long-term projected enrolment figure for St. Colmcilles, on which the accommodation brief was based, a thorough examination of existing postprimary provision in the general area was carried out. I am satisfied there is adequate postprimary provision in the Knocklyon area and accordingly there are no plans to provide additional accommodation at St. Colmcille's. Officials of the planning section will, of course, continue to monitor developments in the Knocklyon area with a view to the timely provision of additional educational facilities should the need emerge.

The Deputy will note that my Department continues to receive the largest number of requests of all public bodies. The majority of the requests are from former residents of industrial and reformatory schools who are seeking access to information about their stay in such institutions.

Section 4(1) of the Act outlines the criteria to be used in making a decision to include additional institutions, including probation hostels. This section provides for the insertion of, by order, any industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage, children's home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental illness in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.

The pupils in question are within two miles of their nearest suitable school and are not eligible for transport under the terms of the scheme. It is not, therefore, open to my Department to offer transport.

Arising from this process, two sites for primary school purposes and one site for post-primary school purposes have been reserved in the Stepaside-Sandyford area. A decision on the provision of new schools in the Stepaside-Sandyford area will involve further consultations with the local authority regarding the rate and likely timescale of housing developments, together with an ongoing assessment of the capacity of existing schools in the area to meet the anticipated demand.

It is included in section 6 of the capital programme for 2003. However, given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, my Department does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to allow architectural planning for further large scale projects to progress beyond their current authorised stage. The timing of when this project can proceed to tender construction is dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The school referred to by the Deputy will retain its present quota of mainstream teaching staff for the 2003-04 school year. Pending receipt of details of the enrolment at the end of September 2003 and the finalisation of the staffing schedule for the 2004-05 school year, it is not possible to indicate whether the school will retain current staffing levels for the 2004-05 school year.

These include a greater openness and accountability, a mission of quality customer service and the efficient and fair operation of simplified regulations. Since its first published strategy, my Department continues to set out its objectives and programmes and publishes these in accordance with the Public Service Management Act. The goals outlined in the strategy statements are incorporated into the business plans of each unit, with performance indicators set by each as part of the planning process.The Department's annual reports of 1999, 2000 and 2001 reported on progress. The trend since 1997 has been one of growing openness and transparency, with major structural reform taking place. In dealing with regulatory reform, the trend has been to place the operations of the Department on a legislative footing, replacing the administrative rules that were set out, usually by circular, prior to this. A number of independent appeals procedures are now in place and where these exist, there is clarity on entitlement to resources and the allocation of those resources. Under the terms of the Sustaining Progress agreement, the Department is committed to producing a customer charter which defines service standards and enforces the Department's commitment to providing service to customers in accordance with the 12 QCS principles. Performance measured against the targets set will be published in annual reports from 2004.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. An independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.

The schemes also provide that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification, with the exception of eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. In the case referred to by the Deputy, a higher diploma in education course does not, under the terms of the scheme, represent progression from a master's degree, and, accordingly, grant assistance is not available in its respect.Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provided for tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full time and part time postgraduate students.Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.

It is organised on a regional basis, with ten regions roughly equivalent to the ten health board regions. This is in order to facilitate communication and co-operation between the agency and the health boards. NEPS has delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students in primary and post-primary schools and in certain other centres supported by the Department. Provision of educational psychological assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in NEPS.The educational psychologists in NEPS address the need for psychological assessments in the schools they serve and also provide advice on the identification and screening of children who might need to be assessed. It will take some time for the backlog of assessment work to be dealt with but good progress is being made. NEPS psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are dealt with in chronological order. Each psychologist is responsible for a number of named schools and visits each on a regular basis.

The revised procedure applies to schools intending to commence operation from 1 September 2003 onwards. As part of this new arrangement applications for new schools are assessed by the new schools advisory committee, which consults with interested parties and reports to me.The timeframe for applications for schools intending to commence operation in September 2004 will be published shortly by my Department and will be notified to all patron bodies, including the Church of Ireland Board of Education. If an application is received from the Church of Ireland Board of Education in respect of the establishment of a new primary school in Clonsilla, this will be considered in the prescribed manner.

The position in the Dublin 15 area generally is quite complex because, while some schools in the area are full to capacity, others are in a position to offer places. Department officials will make contact with all of the schools concerned to determine how the anticipated difficulty in September 2004 can be averted and to reiterate the need for a co-operative enrolment process in the area.The need for additional second level places in the developing areas of Dublin 15, that is, Hansfield, Littlepace and Castaheny has been considered in my Department and as a result a six hectare site has been reserved for educational purposes in the Hansfield SDZ area. A time-frame for acquisition of the site and the development of educational facilities thereon will be dictated by a number of factors, including the rate and pace of housing developments and the availability of capital funding.

As a result, Fingal County Council was requested to reserve a six hectare site within the SDZ for the future education needs of the population of Hansfield. This site is to the west of the village centre. A timeframe for acquisition of the site and the development of educational facilities thereon will be dictated by a number of factors, including the rate and pace of housing developments and the availability of capital funding. My Department will continue to monitor developments in the Hansfield, Littlepace and Castaheny areas with a view to providing sufficient pupil places at both primary and post-primary level to meet the growing demand in these areas.

The position generally is that funding is targeted at children with special educational needs in recognised national schools. In the event that the necessary resources are not available in a recognised school locally, consideration will be given to the allocation of appropriate resources in other settings. All applications for special needs assistant support are considered in the context of the child's assessed needs and the criteria prescribed in Department circulars. My officials will be communicating with the family in question shortly.

The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the stability and growth pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue, as is a standing committee established by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects.The position remains that consideration of the Cork School of Music project will be based on a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes going forward and taking into account the issues surrounding the GGB.

Sites were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using my Department's post-primary pupils database. In addition to the 82 school completion projects, my Department supports 53 second level schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy which were funded previously under the stay in school retention initiative but were not selected for the project strand of this programme. These schools are funded on a phasing out basis to 2005. My Department is reviewing the position in relation to the phasing out of these schools and the introduction of further projects to the programme. The 53 schools involved will be notified of the outcome shortly.

The Higher Education Authority has for a number of years provided dedicated funding to the universities and other Higher Education Authority designated institutions to support new developments in areas of strategic importance in higher education. One particular priority area is that of broadening access to the universities and Higher Education Authority institutions for students from traditionally under-represented groups. These include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and Travellers. In 2002, the Higher Education Authority provided over €6 million to support institutions in initiatives aimed at providing for such broadened access.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1028	As the Deputy will be aware, the promotion of equality in and access to higher education has been one of my key policy priorities since taking office. My over-riding objective is to target those who are most in need and to do so at an appropriate level. Foundation level courses, which are referred to in this question, have never been approved for funding under third level access programmes.In 2001-02, some colleges supported foundation level courses from funds made available by my Department from its disadvantaged initiatives. This was owing to a misinterpretation or lack of clarity in the guidelines issued. This matter was clarified early in 2003 when the Department became aware of the situation. As it has not been the practice of the Department to approve the provision of foundation year courses, the question of withdrawal does not arise. Questions have been raised about the value of putting students from disadvantaged backgrounds through year-long foundation courses for some time now. The Commission on the Points System was not convinced that such courses were appropriate for third level institutions and suggested they should be provided under further education schemes. Equally the action group on third level access commented on the need for appropriate validation of such courses and considered that they should not be a requirement for all access students.

The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	Financial support is available to students in approved third level institutions through my Department's student assistance fund, previously known as the hardship fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. However, the criteria for the fund confines eligibility to students participating on courses of not less than one-year duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. It has not been the practice of my Department to approve the provision of foundation year courses. In 2001-02 some colleges supported foundation level courses from access funds owing to a misinterpretation or lack of clarity in the guidelines issued. This matter was clarified early in 2003 when my Department became aware of the situation. Foundation level courses have never been approved for direct funding by my Department through its third level access programmes.

My Department has received legal advice that this provision might be open to challenge in light of recent case law, however. My Department has recently written to the Office of the Attorney General seeking advice on this matter and on the making of by-laws to control personal watercraft and fast powercraft under section 37(2) of the Local Government Act 1994.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1037	The development of the Seven Heads relies on and uses sub-sea technology which has been developed in recent years. The technology and its equipment are sophisticated and expensive and the cost will absorb much of the development costs for this field. The equipment includes, for example, pipe-laying vessels, manifolds and umbilicals for which there are very few suppliers in Europe. Ireland, like most other countries, does not produce these highly specialised products. This technology has made possible, economically and technologically, the development of small or remote oil and gas fields which would not otherwise have been developed, including Seven Heads. My Department, with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland and FÁS, has facilitated communication between the offshore industry and local industry. As a result local industry is aware of and has the opportunity to compete for the goods and services required by the offshore sector.

Progress on implementing objectives and strategies set out in the strategy statements has been reported on each year in the annual reports of the Departments in question. Progress in 2002 will be reported on in the annual report of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which is due to be published shortly. I will arrange for a copy of the report for 2002 to be forwarded to the Deputy.

Some €13.47 million has been provided in this regard in this year's Estimate provision. The grant-in-aid provision for 2004 in respect of Sustainable Energy Ireland will be set in the context of the finalisation of the 2004 Estimates. The pre-budget or abridged Estimates for 2004 will not be finalised by Government until November this year with the final or Revised Estimates being published in February of 2004. In accordance with the multi-annual budgeting process, existing level of service provisions for 2005 and 2006 will also be agreed in the context of the finalisation of the 2004 Estimates. In September 2002 Sustainable Energy Ireland published its five-year strategy for the period between 2002 and 2007. This document sets out SEI's key programmes and targets for the delivery of the sustainable energy priority of the ESIOP/NDP 2000-06.

It was officially launched in July 2002. The focus of the programme is on stimulating the deployment of renewable energies that are close to market and to assess and develop technologies which have prospects for the future. This could include measures to identify the prospective resource; to stimulate the development of the technologies; to produce implementation plans for those with economic potential; to remove barriers to the deployment of renewable energy; and to help to stimulate an Irish renewable energy industry. This funding is undertaken in the categories of shared cost, public good – full funding – and international collaboration. Based on contracts signed or issued to date, the amount committed under the renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme is approximately €673,500. A further 22 applications which are currently under consideration for funding may be eligible for support of up to €3.5 million. Projects funded to date include those in the renewable energy areas of biomass, wind, wave, solar and geothermal.

Section 6(b) sets out one of the functions of SEI as being “to promote and assist energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy”. In pursuance of these functions, SEI has established a sustainable energy services section with a remit to stimulate the application and further development of renewable energies. Within its existing powers and in the context of the EURES directive, I have asked Sustainable Energy Ireland to assist my Department in the drafting of a consultation document for the future support mechanisms for renewable energy. I shall be pleased to release details of this document this month. SEI has over the months of May and June and in parallel with the above organised a lecture series, Perspectives from Abroad, to inform the industry and policy makers. Eminent speakers from the US and Australia and policy-makers from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands contributed to this series.

A full assessment of all bids is ongoing and I expect to announce the results before the end of this week. I am satisfied that the level of interest expressed in AER VI combined with projects proceeding under the previous AER V round will ensure that the 500 megawatt target set for the sector will be delivered by 2005.

I must ensure, therefore, that the contracts awarded under the recent AER V and AER VI competitions do not exceed the quantity approved by the Commission. Therefore, the combined capacity value of contracts awarded at any time cannot exceed 500 megawatts in aggregate in the biomass, hydro and onshore wind categories. In addition, a Commission decision is awaited for 50 megawatts in the offshore wind category and 28 megawatts in the biomass, combined heat and power, category. The creation of a reserve list and constant monitoring of applications for connections to the electricity network should ensure failing projects can be quickly withdrawn and the capacity re-allocated to ensure the overall targets are delivered by 2005.

The maritime safety directorate of my Department issued the vessel with a short-term passenger boat license based on the UK certification and following an inspection of the vessel carried out by the directorate itself. The vessel complied with the statutory requirements for such vessels and was therefore considered seaworthy. In addition to the normal statutory requirements relating to passenger boat licenses the directorate required all of the television show contestants to undergo approved safety training prior to sailing, including personal survival techniques and familiarisation on board the vessel. The directorate also required the wearing of lifejackets by all persons while on deck.

Recognising that the private sector lacks adequate resources to fund major infrastructure projects, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure, including digital subscriber lines, to regional Ireland using European Regional Development Fund and Government funding. The availability of open-access, affordable, always-on broadband infrastructure and services is the Government's priority aim under the national development plan. Under the communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP, funding of approximately €200 million is being utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced infrastructure and services, to enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education, welfare and health services.

With a strong Exchequer investment in tourism marketing this year, Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland have been able to implement a strong and sustained campaign of marketing activities in our key source markets. The marketing programmes for Britain, continental Europe and the US have been boosted over the last number of weeks to ensure that Ireland is ideally positioned to capitalise on any upturn in consumer confidence in the wake of the Iraqi conflict. I have loaned my support to the marketing effort with visits to Germany, Britain and France earlier this year and a six-day visit to the east and west coasts of the US commencing this week. With some improvement in air access this year, a more flexible approach to the deployment of marketing funds and the maintenance of an active presence in key markets for the rest of the year, Ireland should be well placed to benefit from any significant upturn in the international market over the remainder of the year. If the sector maintains competitiveness and there are no further major external shocks, I believe that Irish tourism can continue to win good tourism business this year.

No additional funding has been set aside for the programme but rather these areas are prioritised for support within existing budgets. The main programmes operated by my Department where a particular focus exists on RAPID areas is the national lottery-funded sports capital programme and the local authority swimming pool programme. One of the stated main objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities. The programme is run on an annual basis and allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.For the 2003 sports capital programme, following consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, it was decided that disadvantaged areas were those that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by Department – RAPID 1, RAPID 2, local drugs task force areas and CLÁR areas. Athy is included in the RAPID 2 scheme.The 2003 programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March 2003 and the closing date for receipt of applications was 25 April. A total of 1,330 applications were received before the closing date. The applications located in the RAPID 2 area of Athy have been identified by the RAPID area implementation team. All applications are being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.Under the local authority swimming pool programme, projects which are developed in areas designated as disadvantaged qualify for financial support at 90% of the eligible cost of the project, subject to a maximum grant of €3.8 million. Contract documents submitted by Kildare County Council for the Athy swimming pool project are currently under consideration in my Department. Grants for swimming pools are not confirmed until a tender for the project has been approved.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1063	The ERHA proposes to develop nine 50-bed community nursing units, three in each of the area health boards, which will provide a total of 450 additional beds. The proposed sites in the East Coast Area Health Board area are at Clonskeagh Hospital, Newcastle Hospital in County Wicklow, and Tivoli Road in Dún Laoghaire. The proposed sites in the Northern Area Health Board area are at St. Joseph's Hospital in Raheny, St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park and Verville, Vernon Avenue, Clontarf. The proposed sites in the South-Western Area Health Board area are at St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital in Palmerstown, Brú Chaoimhín and Cherry Orchard Hospital. It is intended that between 20 and 25 day care places will be provided in each location if the site is conducive to accommodating the service.The public private partnership approach is based on defining the outputs of the facilities such as the level and quality of service. It is simply a statement of need posed in a manner sufficient to communicate what is required without prejudging how the need should be met. Therefore, the square footage of the office and administration unit will not be finalised until the preferred bidder is selected to design, build, finance and partially operate the facilities. This is fundamental to the PPP approach as it allows for innovation from the private sector in determining how the services should be delivered. The feasibility of this project as a PPP has yet to be established and the business advisors appointed by the ERHA will test whether the PPP proposal offers value for money in comparison with the most efficient form of public procurement. If the project is progressed as a PPP, the projected cost to the taxpayer over the lease period cannot be fully determined until the tenders have been received and the contracts have been signed with the preferred bidder.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1067	I presume the Deputy is referring to the Eastern Regional Health Authority's recent decision to prepare protocols in relation to the referral of patients from other health board areas for elective services in hospitals in the eastern region. Successive Governments have pursued a policy of regional self-sufficiency regarding the provision of hospital services to ensure that patients are in a better position to access services locally. The benefits of this policy are evident through a series of major infrastructural developments in hospitals around the country, which has resulted in the availability of more services and new specialties on a regional basis. A number of specialised services are concentrated in the eastern region, however, for reasons of complexity. The ERHA has acknowledged that the referral of patients from outside the region to avail of tertiary and super-regional services in the eastern region remains appropriate given the range and specialised nature of the services provided. The Deputy may wish to note that the ERHA intends to have discussions with the health boards and the acute providers in the region in relation to the development of referral protocols. Having regard to the potential service and budgetary implications of any change in traditional referral patterns, my Department has recently requested the ERHA to advise it of these consultations and to inform it before any revised protocols are implemented.

There has been a major step forward in the implementation of the home help scheme since 1999, in terms of the amount of service delivered and the treatment of the home help providers. The time when home help providers worked for a pittance is long gone. Over €30 million has been injected into the system to ensure that home help providers receive a decent level of pay and other entitlements, such as holidays and sick leave. An additional €7 million has been made available to the health boards to increase the availability of the home help service by employing more home help providers or by increasing the number of hours worked by existing providers.The percentage expenditure increase on the home help service in 2003, compared with 2000, in each health board area, is as follows: ERHA, 45.74%; NEHB, 107.05%; NWHB, 153.13%; MHB, 147.81%; MWHB, 131.62%; SEHB, 155.07%; SHB, 154.47%; WHB, 122.98%. The total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all health board areas since 2000 is 113.59%. The fact that the current overall economic position has had implications for all aspects of public investment is reflected in the Estimates and the budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services within this overall framework. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including the home help service.

Service providers of rehabilitative training for people with disabilities should make their particular additional needs known to the relevant health board or authority in the first instance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	I propose to take Questions Nos. 381, 394 and 418 together.Action 105 of the health strategy commits my Department to strengthening and expanding provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals. In this context, the heads of a Bill establishing a system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals, including physiotherapists, have been approved by the Government. A Bill is being drafted by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel based on the proposals outlined in the heads. Under the health and social care professionals Bill, which is due to be published later this year, it is intended to protect the title of "physiotherapist" in order that only those professionals registered with the registration board for physiotherapists will be legally entitled to use the title. It is also proposed that it will be an offence for an unregistered person to use a protected title or to act in a manner which implies that they are entitled to use a protected title. It would be a matter for the proposed regulatory authority for health and social care professionals to investigate a complaint that a person is misrepresenting themselves in any of these respects.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1079	Under the Health Act 1970 the chief executive officer of a health board is responsible, in the first instance, for determining the terms and conditions of employment for health board employees. Each health board has confirmed to my Department that there is no prohibition on health board employees becoming elected members of local authorities.

Further claims amounting to over €5 million have been made by the association and these claims are being considered by my Department, in consultation with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and the association itself, having regard to the availability of funds. Additional claims for extra staff numbers will also be considered in the light of available resources.The fact that the current overall economic position has had implications for all aspects of public investment is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1081	I have received representations in relation to the person named by the Deputy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1083	The Dentists Act 1985 established the Dental Council to register and control persons engaged in the practice of dentistry. Under the Act, the Dental Council shall also provide for other matters relating to the practice of dentistry including "the adequacy and suitability of postgraduate education and training." I have no plans to review the operation of the Dental Council in this regard. In accordance with the Act, the Dental Council established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics in 1999. Under section 30(1) of the Act, only persons who have completed a recognised specialist training programme in orthodontics are entitled to be registered in this specialist register. The Dental Council has informed me that as neither person referred to by the Deputy had completed a recognised specialist training programme in orthodontics, their names were not admitted to the specialist register. Some 71 orthodontists are currently registered in the register of dental specialists. The Dental Council has further informed me that the persons concerned have applied to the High Court for judicial review of the Dental Council's decision.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1084	Following discussions with the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU, I established a task force in April 2002 to investigate the incidence of assaults on psychiatric nurses, with a view to exploring preventative measures to reduce such incidences. The task force was also charged with providing for a compensation scheme for nurses working in the mental health services, as a practical measure, where such assaults have resulted in serious physical and psychological injury. The task force was chaired by Mr. Tom McGrath, former deputy chairman of the Labour Court. Membership of the task force included representatives of the relevant nursing unions, PNA and SIPTU, the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance.The task force's terms of reference included investigating the reasons for such assaults with a view to putting in place effective preventative measures; examining the incidence of assaults on nurses and the level of injury therefrom; putting forward proposals for an appropriate compensation scheme for nurses injured through assault at work, such proposals to have regard to the special position of psychiatric nurses; and preparing and presenting a report of its findings and recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children. The report deals with the causes and effects of violent acts in mental health services and makes a number of practical recommendations in relation to preventing and minimising the incidence of assaults. The report also sets out a framework for a scheme of compensation for psychiatric nurses who have been seriously injured as a result of an assault in the workplace.

The amounts so provided were €1.27 million in 1999, €1.27 million in 2000, €2.54 million in 2001 and €1.03 million in 2002. This amounts to a total of over €6 million in the period between 1999 and 2002. Many carers will have benefited from the developments in services for older people from 1997 to 2002.

The proposals included the provision of personal information as a right to all parties to adoption and the establishment of a voluntary contact register, a State-funded tracing and reunion service, a contact veto register, a national search service and a national files index. Personal information has been excluded from freedom of information legislation because of the complexities of adoption legislation and the sensitive nature of adoption. The proposals approved by the Government aimed to provide information in a structured manner and would have met the standards of information provision set down in the freedom of information legislation.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1092	The Deputy will be aware that the recently published health service reform programme draws on analysis made by Prospectus strategy consultants in the audit of structures and functions in the health system. In looking at the range of agencies operating in the sector, the consultants found that complex and fragmented structures were an obstacle to achieving improvements, that there was scope for the rationalisation of certain agencies and that a lack of standardisation and co-ordination was evident across the system. The consolidated structure recommended by the consultants forms the basis of the health reform programme. The reorganisation of the system provides the opportunity to mainstream a number of agencies.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1096	The foster care allowance is paid in respect of children who have been taken into the care of a health board under the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 for their care and protection and placed in foster care or relative care by the health board in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers and draw up a child care plan. The Deputy will appreciate that responsibility in relation to the individual case referred to by him is a matter for the South-Western Area Health Board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to have the matter investigated by the area health board and a direct reply issued to the Deputy as soon as possible.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1110	There has been a significant increase in the number of freedom of information requests submitted to my Department over the past two years. This increase is attributed mainly to the number of people seeking records held about child care services, including records relating to placements in orphanages or other long-term care facilities.In 2001 my Department received 448 requests. In 2002 the number increased to 997, over 50% of which were relating to people seeking personal information about their time, as children, spent in the care of the State. In 2003 to date, 525 requests have been received. The breakdown of requests logged by month is as follows:
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1111	I am advised that collection of the information in the format requested by the Deputy was commenced by the Inspectorate of Mental Hospitals in 2000.In 2000 there were 1,088 assaults on staff in the mental health services of which 74 were deemed serious. In 2001 there were 1,081 assaults on staff of which 89 were deemed serious. For the purpose of collection of this data, a serious assault is one where the injured party required medical intervention following the assault. Data in relation to 2002 has not yet been collated.While it is not possible to comment on individual cases, I am advised that, in general, staffing levels do not constitute a significant contributory cause of assaults in the mental health services.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1114	Following the publication of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health service in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.Given the key role of the Health Boards Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course.This work is being undertaken in light of: service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1115	My Department has made substantial progress since 1997 on actions under the strategic management initiative which are set out below. The Department is working to refine and improve the development of indicators and the measurement of output as demonstrated in both the national health strategy and the recently published departmental strategy. This work is being done in tandem with the monitoring requirements under the verification process for Sustaining Progress. Overall my Department has made significant strides since 1997 in the development of an evaluation culture, both internally through improved business processes and externally through the development of service planning and associated performance indicators.The departmental strategy statement 2003 – 2005 was published in May 2003. The principles and goals of the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, and the commitment of the Department to the public service modernisation programme underpin the departmental strategy. Formal business planning was introduced in 2000 and the process has been refined continuously. Explicit links are in place between the strategy statement objectives, business plans and individual role profiles to promote greater focus on departmental objectives and individual performance.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1119	The health services executive will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity. As the Deputy will be aware, the executive will be organised on the basis of three core divisions: the national hospitals office; the primary, community and continuing care directorate; and the national shared services centre.The new structure set out in this reform programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system. This is not a centralisation of services, it is a streamlining of the management of the system to create greater efficiencies.

In addition differences do arise in the application of means testing to applicants for enhanced subventions. These are payments made by health boards in excess of the normal nursing home subvention rates and are provided for under Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations 1993. They may be paid at the discretion of the individual health boards within the context of their overall funding allocation, in accordance with the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996.In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. This review was launched last week in association with my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs who also launched a report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland.A comprehensive review of the nursing home regulations is also being undertaken within my Department. The objective of the review is to develop a scheme which will be transparent, offer a high standard of care for clients and provide equity within the system to include standardised dependency and means testing; be less discretionary; provide both a home and nursing home subvention depending on need; and be consistent in implementation throughout the country and draw on experience of the operation of the old scheme. My Department will also be consulting with all stakeholders as part of the review process.

The directive establishes harmonised rules within the EU for the sale and labelling of vitamins and minerals as dietary supplements. Article 5 of the directive requires that maximum levels for vitamins and minerals be set based on scientific risk assessment and taking account of data on vitamin and mineral intake from other foods, while also taking due account of what is considered an adequate vitamin and mineral intake for an average person. As these provisions are included in the directive, they will be adopted in accordance with the standard procedures as set out in the directive and will not be subject to separate negotiation. The Scientific Committee on Food has established upper safe levels for a variety of vitamins and minerals and this work is now continuing under the aegis of the European Food Safety Authority.

Accordingly when they are in use in a public place they are subject to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use) Regulations 1963 to 2003 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. In accordance with section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, all mechanically propelled vehicles used in a public place must be covered by an insurance policy that provides unlimited cover for liabilities to third parties. The user of a quadricycle in a public place must hold a category B driving licence.The Road Traffic Acts create the offences for which the Garda may prosecute under their general powers as referred to in section 126 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.

The then Department of Transport and Power was originally responsible for proposing the establishment of the zones, which were approved and incorporated in the local authorities' development plans, and development within those red zones is controlled by the local authorities through the Planning Acts.I should at this point describe for the Deputy precisely what the red zones are, and how they are based on ICAO standards. International civil aviation operates under the 1944 Chicago Convention which is administered by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Annexe 14 of the convention, which prescribes standards for aerodromes, recommends that certain pathways through the air on approaches to runways should be clear of obstacles at certain heights, depending on how far away they are from the runway. These are known as "obstacle clearance surfaces", and are imaginary slopes in the air extending away from the ends of runways. They were designed for the protection of aircraft taking off and landing, as an aid to safe navigation. If those slopes in the air are, on a map, projected onto the ground, they form a trapezoid shape, with the narrow base at the end of the runway.

Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.Since 1 June 2003 penalty points are applicable to the offence of driving without insurance. These points will apply on court conviction.Penalty points are endorsed on the licence record held in the national driver file upon conviction for a speeding or insurance offence, or upon payment of a fixed charge for speeding. In the case of speeding offences, the system operates in such a way that the offer of paying a fixed charge is always provided and a person has 56 days within which to pay the charge. The 56-day period comprises an initial 28-day period within which a €80 fixed charge can be paid, followed by a further 28-day period within which a fixed charge of €120 can be paid. If a person opts not to pay, the case is taken to court. These periods are built into the system and ensure that every opportunity is afforded to the person to pay the fixed charge and avoid a court hearing. There is therefore an inevitable and intrinsic time-lapse between the issue of the notices, the payment of the fixed charge and the notification of the endorsement of penalty points. In this context, the first penalty point notifications issued in December 2002 despite the fact that penalty points for speeding had been operational since 31 October 2002. The following table sets out the number of notifications issued each month since December 2002.

I understand from ADM that Meath accessible transport is one of the 34 rural transport schemes being funded under the RTI. It was awarded funding of €98,581 in 2002 and €117,274 in 2003 under the RTI.While passenger numbers vary from month to month I am informed that over 300 passengers benefited from the scheme in County Meath in May last. Under the scheme, there are fixed and flexi – bus routes. The fixed route services operate between Athboy and Trim and between Navan and Kells. The flexi-bus routes serve Tierworker, Drumconrath, Ballincree, Athboy, Moylagh and Wilkinstown. In addition school bus services for children with disabilities are also provided in the Navan area. I understand that Meath accessible transport is currently planning the development of some new routes in the eastern part of the county.As regard the further development of the RTI I have asked ADM for a report on the progress of the initiative to date and I await their report on the matter.

Given the route's very low passenger base and poor results when evaluated, the consultants who prepared the report concluded that a significant change of circumstances in the form of complementary land use and transportation strategies would be required to develop a strong case for this proposal.However, as I have stated before, the review lays down a challenge to those supporting schemes, such as the Limerick Junction-Rosslare rail link, to establish a clear and convincing case for proposals based on solid economic, social and demographic grounds.

The person referred to in the Deputy's question has complied with Appendices A and B of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies in that he has disclosed at all times his chairmanship of a telecommunications company licensed by the Commission for Communications Regulations. This information has been disclosed in CIE's register of directors and secretaries as required under section 195 of the Companies Act 1963. This information has been disclosed in the CIE chairman's statements of annual interests for the relevant years as required under section 17 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995. This information has been disclosed to the Standards in Public Office Commission as also required under section 17 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and has never been queried. The chairmanship of the telecommunications company does not conflict with the ESAT contract, the terms of which were completed by CIE in 1998. The person in question did not become a CIE board member until March 2000. The person's role in the telecommunications company has not given rise to a conflict in any way with his role in CIE.

Article 17 of these regulations provides that where the applicable traffic sign is provided at the entrance to a road, the driver of a vehicle, the unladen weight of which exceeds the weight specified on the sign, is prohibited from proceeding beyond the sign except where it is necessary for the vehicle to enter a road solely for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible only from that road. The application of such restrictions is a matter for each local authority.Traffic management plans drawn up by local authorities may provide for the re-routing of heavy goods vehicles away from residential areas. The preparation of a traffic management plan taking account of the availability of alternative routes is a matter for the road authority concerned.

Incidents that are motivated by racism, sectarianism, homophobia, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are recorded on the PULSE computer system. Where such incidents occur, the Garda Síochána ensures that an investigation is pursued with reference to the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Prohibition of the Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, which are the relevant legislative instruments pertaining to hate crime.All student-probationer gardaí receive training on dealing with hate motivated crimes.

An exploratory study on drug use among prisoners, which was part funded by my Department, was published in 2001 by the Health Research Board. This study, which focused on the Mountjoy Prison complex, found that once imprisoned, those who continued to engage in illicit drug use, greatly reduced the quantity of drugs they used and the frequency with which they used them, when compared to their drug use in the community. The study also found that initiation into drug use in the prison setting was rare.There is no anecdotal evidence to suggest that the use of illegal drugs in prisons is on the increase. On the contrary, some indications are that there has been a decrease in the use of illegal drugs in recent times. The introduction of the methadone maintenance programme in a number of our prisons has resulted in a significant number of offenders who would have been on report for using illegal drugs in the prison environment now being on a stable programme where they must supply at least two urine samples per week. The Governor of Mountjoy Prison has also reported that there appears to be a reduction of the number of prisoners appearing at disciplinary hearings having been found in the possession of drugs or drugs paraphernalia. The new visiting arrangements in the prison and the methadone maintenance programme referred to above appear to be two of the reasons behind this decrease.The Irish Prison Service is resolutely committed to tackling drug abuse in prisons in a comprehensive manner and has my full support in this. It involves a twin track approach of preventing supply and addressing the needs of addicts.I will publish a drug policy for prisons this year which will comprehensively address the issues of prevention and treatment of drug abuse among prisoners.

In view of the fact that the applicants are members of the same family, it has been decided to process the applications together. The average processing time of applications for naturalisation is approximately 15 months at present.

Culprits have been made amenable for one of the burglaries, while the other is currently being investigated.I am informed that the incidents of public disorder refer to youths drinking in the park at the Royal Canal Bank. The names and addresses of offenders drinking in these public areas have been recorded and Dublin City Council have been notified so as to enable notices to be issued under the Dublin Corporation (Prohibition of Consumption of Intoxicating Liquor on Streets and in Public Places) Bye Laws 2000. Since April 2003, 15 such notices have been applied for.

The implementation of the directive will have implications for the age provision of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The Government has approved the drafting of legislation to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 to give effect to three EU equality directives including Directive 2000/78/EC. Any implications for admission to the Garda Síochána will be considered in that context.My objective is to have a fit, active and experienced force with an appropriate balance as regards the age profile.The Deputy also sought information on the age limits applied for recruitment to the national police force in other EU countries. The information sought is not readily available but I am having inquiries made and I shall be in touch with the Deputy in due course.

However, the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor in these clubs is controlled by the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2000 and by the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2000.

It is therefore open to the Garda Síochána to enter such premises for the purposes of preventing and detecting the violation of any of the provisions of the licensing laws.

In doing this the primary consideration is the legal duty placed on the prison governor to ensure that the person concerned is brought safely and securely before the court. The use of handcuffs and short chains is necessary as borne out over many years by the many attempts by prisoners on escorts to escape from custody and to assault staff. It is standard operating procedure in penal systems throughout the world to take such steps as are necessary to prevent persons escaping from custody while on escort outside of the prison.While I believe that it is most undesirable that prisoners should be seen in handcuffs by members of the public, including potential jurors and members of the media, many court locations do not allow for the delivery of a prisoner directly to their destination without coming into public view. I do, however, strongly reject the implication that prisoners are ever "paraded" in public. On the contrary, the Prison Service makes every effort to protect the privacy of prisoners by a number of measures. These measures include arriving early for court hearings, conducting escorts within the courts after the jury rooms have been cleared and attempting to arrive in transport as close as possible to the courts in order to reduce the length of time that a prisoner has to spend in the public eye.

The Garda authorities are represented on the Athy RAPID area implementation team and I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a RAPID proposal for a community garda programme is currently being developed at Athy Garda station. This programme is an extension of the current neighbourhood watch scheme.No dedicated departmental financial allocations have been made to provide potential funding for proposals received under the RAPID programme as such. However, my Department decides on approving funding for RAPID proposals within the context of existing allocations across Votes under my Department's remit. Particular priority is given to RAPID proposals which fall within the functional areas financed under the national development plan. I can, however, assure the Deputy that any proposals received through the RAPID programme for Athy will be given full and careful consideration.

Gardaí at the Bridewell indicate that the activities of these youths cannot be attributed to the existence of the off-licence, but to the fact that the newsagents/grocery business services an area where the majority of these youths reside.

This programme was established in 1997 in response to the activities of organised criminal gangs to facilitate those persons who are prepared to give evidence against alleged offenders. It operates under the direct control and administration of the Garda Commissioner.For reasons which the Deputies will appreciate, it is established policy not to disclose information relating to the numbers of persons included in the witness security programme or to disclose procedures relating to its operation.The cost of the witness security programme has been as follows:

No other immigrants are accommodated in direct provision.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1178	As I have already indicated to the House, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe, was established under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment in 1987. The committee is composed of lawyers, medical doctors, prison experts, parliamentarians, etc. from the member states and carries out its task by periodic and ad hoc visits. During these visits, the committee has the right of unimpeded access at any time of the day or night to any place where persons are detained, whether it be a prison, a Garda station or a mental hospital, and are entitled to speak in private to any detained person.The CPT visited Ireland for inspection purposes in May of last year and the report to the Irish Government on this visit has been received in my Department. In line with the provisions of the convention, the Government must respond to the CPT on the findings contained in the report. I will be bringing the report and the proposed responses to its findings to Government very shortly.In line with the policy of previous Governments, I expect to publish the report along with the responses to the findings once these have been approved by Government and conveyed to the CPT.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1179	I am informed that the funding in question was sought from the European Commission in 1999 by the Irish Refugee Council in conjunction with a number of other organisations. Its purpose was to fund a project titled Irish Refugee Arrivals Project, the aim of which was, inter alia,"to enhance existing services at Dublin airport for persons entering the State to seek asylum".I understand that my Department was not consulted about the proposed project prior to its submission to the Commission for funding purposes although departmental officials held discussions on the project with both the funding applicants and a representative of the Commission after it was submitted.I am informed that the Department was not in a position to support the project as constituted for a number of reasons which were communicated to the Irish Refugee Council by letter on 22 June 2000.I understand that the Commission subsequently indicated its intention to cancel its support for the project in July 2000.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1180	The Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 strengthens the disciplinary regime for solicitors in a number of respects of which the following are examples. It doubles the size of the tribunal to cater for an increased workload and the speedier processing of cases. The tribunal is now required to make a separate finding on each ground of alleged misconduct. Regard must be had to previous findings of misconduct by a solicitor when imposing a sanction in the current case. The maximum amount which a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, may be ordered to pay to an aggrieved party or to the Law Society's compensation fund increased from £5,000 to €15,000. There is a right of appeal to the High Court on all aspects of the tribunal's work. The Act provides for remedies against solicitors who fail to co-operate with investigations. The circumstances in which the Law Society may refuse to issue a practising certificate or impose conditions on a certificate are spelt out in more detail than before. The circumstances in which the society can send an investigator to inspect documents at a solicitor's office are also extended.The purpose of the new provisions is to make the disciplinary regime for solicitors more effective. Their operation will, of course, be kept under review. In that context, I remind the Deputy that the Progressive Democrats election manifesto 2002 contains a commitment to establish an office of statutory ombudsman to protect the interests of clients of the legal profession. This commitment is not included in the Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. However, in the foreword to the agreed programme, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste state that, in Government, it is open to either party to seek to persuade colleagues to pursue any individual policy included in their respective manifestos. Accordingly, it remains open as to whether proposals to Government for the establishment of a statutory ombudsman for the legal profession will be made.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1181	In September of last year I established the legal advisory group on defamation to report back to me on a range of matters related to the reform of the law of defamation. The report of that group was published on 20 June and was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 23 June.I have now initiated a public consultation process whereby interested parties are invited to submit their views on the report and its recommendations. The deadline for receipt of submissions is 31 December 2003.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1182	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí at Naas are aware of the issue raised by the Deputy and are currently in the process of conducting a comprehensive investigation into the complaint.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1183	An increase in the use of cocaine, both nationally and internationally and particularly among young professionals, was one of the emerging trends identified during the public consultation process in developing the national drugs strategy 2001-08 and by the European monitoring centre in Lisbon. Garda statistics on the number of possession offences for cocaine also suggest an increase in its usage.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the potential for licensed premises to be used for the distribution and use of all controlled drugs, including cocaine is addressed by strict enforcement of legislation and joint initiatives involving both the licensed trade and the Garda Síochána.The Garda national drugs unit in conjunction with divisional and district drug units conduct covert operations in locations where drug dealing is suspected of taking place in licensed premises. The aims of these operations are to identify and prosecute individuals involved in the sale and distribution of controlled substances in licensed premises and to bring to the attention of the owners and management of these premises the fact that such activity is taking place and require them to take all necessary steps to ensure that such activities cease.Over the past 12 months, the Garda national drugs unit alone has conducted 35 such operations in a variety of locations throughout the country. These figures do not include local initiatives conducted by divisional and district drug units. In addition, nine warning notices under the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act 1997 have been served on the owners of licensed premises.

They will be informed when a decision has been made in their case.I should say that in the event of temporary leave to remain being refused, the couple will be served with deportation orders which will require them to leave the State and remain outside it thereafter. The option of voluntary return to Poland is still available to them should they wish to exercise it.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1189	Quadricycles including those with generic names such as "quad" or "atv", are regarded as mechanically propelled vehicles under the 1961 Road Traffic Act. Accordingly, when they are in use in a public place they are subject to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use) Regulations 1963 to 2003 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. In accordance with section 56 of the 1961 Road Traffic Act, all mechanically propelled vehicles used in a public place must be covered by an insurance policy that provides unlimited cover for liabilities to third parties. The user of a quadricycle in a public place must hold a category B driving licence.The Road Traffic Acts create the offences for which the gardaí may prosecute under their general powers as referred to in section 126 of the 1961 Road Traffic Act.

According to the report, the total waste accepted into Irish landfills in 1998 was 8,780,201 tonnes, of which 1,125,698, or 13%, was household waste.I expect to have updated statistics shortly when the EPA publishes its national waste database report for 2001.

A listing of the local authorities concerned is being finalised and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.In terms of separate collection, the latest information indicates that, taking both local authority and private collection areas together, segregated collection services are available to approximately 500,000 households in the State.

The county council-led task forces in the Border region are responsible for the delivery of the locally-based regeneration and development strategies priority at a local level. The total amount of EU and Exchequer funding available to the task forces under these measures is €22.6 million.My Department has allocated just over €8 million this year to the six task forces under Peace II. This included €4.49 million which the task forces committed to various projects last year. The following table sets out the allocations to date on a county basis.

Electronic voting is a desirable modernisation of our electoral procedures and public reaction to the use of voting machines in the pilot constituencies has been extremely positive.The Nedap voting machine has been used successfully for years and gained the acceptance of the public and politicians in other countries and I anticipate a similar outcome in Ireland. I refer also to the reply to Question No. 79 of 17 June 2003.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1200	Section 34(1) of the Waste Management Act 1996 requires the collector of waste, where waste is collected on a commercial basis, to obtain a waste collection permit from the relevant local authority. The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2001 set out the regulatory framework for the making of permit applications. Under article 7 of the regulations, an application for a permit must include considerable details regarding the applicant. These include, inter alia, the applicant's name, the trade name(s) of the business, the address(es) and telephone numbers etc of the principal place of business, the types and quantities of waste to be collected and the areas in which the activity will be carried out, as well as the location of any facility that will be used by the applicant, supported by the reference numbers of any relevant waste permit or licence for such facilities.Local authorities are directly responsible for the enforcement of the permitting regime, and my Department has no direct function in this matter.Under section 32 of the Waste Management Act 1996, holders of waste have a general duty of care which provides that they should transfer the control of waste to appropriately authorised persons only. In that regard, a waste collector's authorised status can be ascertained by requiring the collector to demonstrate that he or she is in possession of the appropriate waste collection permit.I should point out that under the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, ASAI, codes of practice, advertisers have primary responsibility for ensuring that their advertisements are legal and do not contain anything that incites people to break the law.

Relevant local authorities have been specifically requested to consider such sales. Each application must be examined on an individual basis to ensure the arrangements made will be in the best interests of the purchaser.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1207	I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 and 541 together.The Ballingeary sewerage scheme was eleventh in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Cork County Council for its southern division in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council and the level of competing demand, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1208	The RAPID programme initiative seeks to frontload and prioritise in the most disadvantaged areas in the country, investment already indicated under the national development plan. Forty-five areas are included in the programme; Strand I of RAPID relates to 25 urban areas and Strand II to 20 provincial towns.Apart from expenditure on projects, my Department supports the RAPID programme in a number of ways, including the funding of local co-ordinators for each RAPID area, co-ordination of the programme across the Department and ongoing consultation with senior management in the local authorities concerned. In addition, public agencies, including local authorities, are already providing a wide range of services in all RAPID areas. My Department provides funding to local authorities for many of these services.Two RAPID projects for Athy were submitted to my Department by the local area implementation team. Details, as available, regarding progress on implementation of these projects is set out in the following table.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1213	In my Department's Statement of Strategy 1998-2001, Statement of Strategy 2001-2004 and Statement of Strategy 2003-2005, key performance indicators are identified for each of the Department's areas of responsibility. Progress in implementing the statement of strategy is set out annually in the Department's annual report. Copies of the annual reports for 1998 to 2001 are available in the Oireachtas Library. The annual report for 2002 will be published shortly.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1214	My Department has recently received pre-tender documents from Kerry County Council in regard to a two house scheme at Woodbrook, Caherciveen, County Kerry. The proposal is currently under examination and it is expected that a decision will be made shortly.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1215	Killarney National Park is managed primarily for nature conservation in accordance with IUCN (World Conservation Union) guidelines on the management of protected areas.Rhododendron ponticum is an introduced shrub which escaped into the wild and is capable of spreading very vigorously through woodland, bog and heathland. It poses a particularly serious threat to the survival of our native oakwoods by casting dense shade, killing off the ground vegetation and preventing trees such as oak and yew from regenerating. For this reason, a programme of rhododendron clearance has been ongoing in Killarney National Park for many years.Rhododendron removal is a difficult process. Cutting alone is not sufficient as the cut plant re-grows more vigorously than ever. Cutting therefore needs to be accompanied by herbicide treatment. The preferred treatment is glyphosate which, when used with the correct equipment in the right weather conditions and away from watercourses, is considered safe for operators and has minimal environmental impacts. It is widely used in agriculture in Ireland and is not seen as a threat to human or animal health. It has been in use in Killarney National Park for many years and studies on the aquatic flora and fauna in the lakes adjacent to the clearance areas have never shown any sign of deleterious impact. The limited use of herbicide treatment for this purpose is also generally consistent with a recent OSPAR recommendation on best environmental practice for the use of pesticides on amenity areas.With regard to the commercial value and export potential of rhododendron, my Department has, as an interim measure, allowed a private company to harvest rhododendron shoots thereby complementing the park's ongoing clearance programme. The company involved has been made aware that this is not a permanent arrangement and advised of my Department's conservation policy regarding the eventual eradication of rhododendron ponticum from the park.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1216	Waterford County Council has submitted a revised cost plan and contract documents for a new fire station at Ardmore to my Department.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1218	I was disappointed by the press release referred to by the Deputy. I consider that it did not accurately represent the general experience of students attending Irish summer colleges in the Gaeltacht, which is very positive, enjoyable and stimulating.There are clear rules and procedures in place regarding standards of accommodation approved by my Department under scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge and regarding the care of students staying in such accommodation. Any household seeking approval from my Department under the scheme is inspected by an official from my Department, who seeks to ensure that the accommodation is suitable in every way.Accommodation and safety requirements include: a minimum of 300 cubic feet per person in every bedroom, a bed for each individual student, and suitable storage and other accommodation amenities for each student; and minimum requirements that must be met for washing and hygiene facilities.Prior to approving a household under the scheme, the Garda Síochána are approached by my Department. The fire safety authorities are notified each year of the houses keeping students and the number of students in each house. In this context, the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981 also apply to each household.Checks are made on approved houses by my Department, usually while the courses are in progress. If the required standards are not being met, the house in question is removed from the approved list.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1219	The community development support programmes (CDSPs) provide financial assistance to locally-based groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities, towards the staffing and equipping of community resource centres and other specialised projects and initiatives. In the region of €21.3 million has been provided in 2003 to meet my Department's commitments under these programmes. In 2002 some €22.5 million was provided to these schemes. This compares with €16.15 million in 2001 and €13.7 million in 2000.There are currently some 190, of which five are based in County Kerry community development projects and issue based groups receiving support under the CDSP. Of these, 160 are in receipt of core funding and 30 are approved, in principle, for inclusion in the programme. Notwithstanding the current tight economic situation, I am pleased to confirm that I will be able to allocate funding to 15 of these groups with effect from September 2003, in fulfilment of Partnership 2000 commitments. In this regard, each project will receive a renewable one year contract for funding totalling €60,000 and assistance towards start-up costs up to a maximum of €27,000 per project. Pre-development work is under way in the remaining 15 pro-actively targeted areas and I hope, subject to available resources, to be able to fund these groups in 2004.The projects currently based in County Kerry are:South West Kerry Womens Association, Cahirciveen;Tralee Womens Regional Centre, Tralee;Kerry County Network of People with Disabilities, Tralee;Tralee Community Development Project, Tralee;Kerry Travellers Community Development Project, Tralee.

The number of requests received in each month is set out as follows.2002
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1222	The Deputy will be aware that my Department was established in June of 2002 and has assumed responsibility for a range of matters which were previously under the remit of six other Departments.My Departments strategy statement covering the period 2003-05, copies of which were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 19 June last, sets out my Departments objectives, strategies and associated performance indicators across its range of responsibilities for the period until the end of 2005. A copy of the document, which is available on my Departments website, www.pobail.ie has also been forwarded to the Deputy.The strategy statement highlights my Departments goals regarding its four main areas of operation as follows:Community and local development goal – to encourage and facilitate communities, with a special focus on areas of disadvantage, to pursue social and economic progress in their areas; tackling drug misuse goal – to facilitate a more integrated and co-ordinated response by State agencies to tackle drug misuse with the aim of significantly reducing the harm caused to individuals and society; rural, Gaeltacht and islands development goal – to promote and maintain living and working populations in rural and Gaeltacht areas and on the islands, by helping to foster sustainable and culturally vibrant communities in those areas; and maintenance and promotion of the Irish language goal – to increase the use of the Irish language countrywide and to support the maintenance of the language in Gaeltacht areas.The strategy statement 2003-05 goes on to detail the key outputs, strategies and performance indicators in respect of these goals. I look forward to receiving and publishing my Departments annual reports, produced in accordance with the Public Service Management Act 1997, on the progress achieved each year in relation to these goals and strategies.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1223	The social insurance system plays a key role in the provision of social protection in Irish society. People, when they are economically active, make contributions to the social insurance fund according to their ability to pay and depending on the range of benefits and pensions for which they are covered. These payments fund the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors and also pay benefits to persons who are not working by reason of contingencies such as unemployment or illness. Contributors, accordingly, build up entitlements to various pensions and benefits which are paid to them as of right, without having to undergo a means test.The social insurance concept is underpinned by the concept of social solidarity and the social insurance system is founded on a long-term commitment by employers, employees, the self-employed and the State. It plays a major role in income redistribution and underpins solidarity not only between generations but also between those at work and those currently not at work. This means that the contributions of workers are pooled for the benefit of all contributors if and when various contingencies arise. There is no direct proportional link between the amount of contributions paid by individual insured contributors and the potential vulnerability of contributors to individual risks such as occupational accidents, illness or longevity. Contributors generally, in a practical expression of social solidarity, support those who are more vulnerable or insecure to the advantage of society as a whole.In the case raised by the Deputy, a single person could marry and later become a widow or widower at any stage in their life. I do not consider it appropriate to exempt from part of their contribution any group of persons, who are currently covered by the system and who are liable to make social insurance contributions. I consider that such a move would be a retrograde step which would serve to weaken the social insurance system as a whole and I have no plans to change the situation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1224	I propose to take Questions Nos. 555 and 561 together.The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Children who are registered as blind or visually impaired are also entitled to free travel.The free travel companion pass scheme was introduced in 1990 for persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge. Recipients of the carer's allowance from my Department are entitled to a companion free travel pass.The purpose of the companion pass scheme is to ensure that a person's entitlement to free travel is not diminished because a companion cannot afford to accompany them. Allowing companion pass holders to use their pass when not accompanying the principal travel pass holder would be outside the objective of the scheme. Any further extension to the free travel scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1225	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1226	The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education scheme designed to assist unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups who are being held back in their search for employment by a lack of qualifications.A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out last year. In the light of this, and of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised.In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme, I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those who most need training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In line with this, payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued for BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment as many students traditionally find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months.Of course, participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions. All other participants on the scheme, lone parents and people with disabilities, remain unaffected by this decision and retain payment during the summer period.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1227	In response to the question tabled by the Deputy on 11 December, 2002, he was advised that the person concerned would be entitled to €262.10 per week from 2 January 2003 if he qualified for full-rate old age contributory pension, that is, a 100% pension.The person concerned reached age 66 on 29 January 2003 and applied for old age contributory pension on 8 May 2003. On examination of his record he qualified from age 65 for a 98% retirement pension at the weekly personal rate of €144.40 plus a qualified adult allowance of €98.10 increasing to €154.20 and €104.80 respectively from 2 January 2003. As this is higher than his current weekly rate of invalidity pension of €250.30 arrangements are being made to put retirement pension into payment. Arrears of pension less invalidity pension already paid since 31 January 2002 will be issued as soon as possible.The total rate of pension is currently €259.00. The maximum rate of retirement pension and old age contributory pension, which is payable for a yearly contributions average of 48 or over, is €262.10. The record of the person concerned, when examined does not entitle him to pension at the maximum rate.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1228	The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups, including people who have been unemployed for a certain minimum period, to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.To qualify for participation in the scheme an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, 156 days, immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1229	The farm assist scheme, which introduced special arrangements for farmers on low incomes came into operation with effect from April 1999.The amount paid to each farmer is dependent on a number of factors, for example, family size, whether the spouse/partner is working and means assessed from all sources. At week ending 21 June 2003, 3,276 single persons were in receipt of a farm assist payment and the average weekly amount paid to these customers was €93.89.The scheme makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1230	The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide fully for their heating needs.Under the scheme an allowance of €9.00 per week is paid to eligible households for the duration of the fuel season which lasts for 29 weeks.Recipients of widow's (non-contributory) pensions are entitled to a fuel allowance. Recipients of widow's (contributory) pensions may qualify for the allowance if they have a combined household income not more than €50.79 per week or savings-investments not more than €41,901.35 above the maximum pension rate. These rules apply to all widows irrespective of age or place of residence.The question of removing the means test either for all widows or for widows over a certain age, or increasing the income limit would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1231	The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. There are currently 20,600 people in receipt of the allowance at a cost of €160 million last year.The carer's allowance means test assesses the income of both the carer and his-her spouse or partner. This is consistent with all other social assistance schemes and ensures that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial increases in the means disregards. In April 2003, the weekly income disregards increased to €210 for a single carer and to €420 for a couple. The effect of this increase is that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to €24,150, can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance.The same couple, if they had an income of €39,750, could still qualify for partial carer's allowance, the free schemes and the respite care grant. It is estimated that an additional 1,700 carers now qualify for the allowance and 2,800 existing carers receive an increased payment as a result of this measure. It is estimated that abolition of the means test could cost in the region of €150 million per annum.In budget 2003, I increased the annual respite care grant by €100 to €735 and to €1470 for carers who are caring for more than one person. This increase has resulted in a trebling of the grant since its introduction in 1999.All other matters relating to the provision and availability of respite care are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.

This expenditure related to the purchase of computer hardware, software, computer ancillaries, the maintenance and support of hardware and the licensing of software. In addition a total of some €3.73 million was spent on consultancy assistance for projects in the IT area.Provision has been made in the 2003 Estimates for expenditure of €8.95 million for IT equipment and related expenditure and €7.877 million for IT related consultancy support by my Department.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1236	The person concerned made a claim for maternity benefit on 12 June 2003 in respect of her maternity leave which commenced on 10 June 2003. Benefit is payable where a person is in insurable employment covered under the Maternity Protection Act and where they have sufficient PRSI contributions paid.Based on her social insurance record and the information supplied with her application form, it appears that the person concerned has insufficient PRSI contributions paid to qualify for maternity benefit.My Department has sought on a number of occasions further information from her employer, who is based in the UK, in relation to PRSI contributions paid in the last twelve months. On receipt of this information her entitlement to maternity benefit will be appropriately determined.Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-07-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1237	The Public Service Management Act 1997 requires each Government Department-Office to produce a statement of strategy which outlines the organisation's key objectives and performance indicators relating to the achievement of those objectives. In this regard, my Department has recently published its fourth statement of strategy, Promoting a Caring Society, which covers the period 2003-05.A copy of this strategy statement is available in the Oireachtas Library and I have arranged for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.The Department has also published a customer action plan and an internal customer service plan, both of which set out specific targets in relation to the provision of service to customers of the Department, both external and internal, over the three year period 2001-04.The key indicators of performance in the Department relate to the processing of social welfare payments, control savings and levels of customer satisfaction with the services provided.
