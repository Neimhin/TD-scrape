            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_5">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Since the beginning of 2004, 40 freedom of information requests were received in my Department. Of these requests, 20 were granted or part granted, no records were held in respect of nine, four were refused, three were withdrawn, two were transferred to other Departments and two are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">Some 139 requests were received during the same period in 2003 and 128 were received in the same period in 2002. The Department has received €450 in application fees since the beginning of this year. All requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with the 1997 and 2003 Acts and their implementation is kept under constant review.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_8">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply in which he stated that 20 of the 40 requests were granted. Is it possible for him to indicate how many of the refusals were appealed to the Information Commissioner? I would not be surprised if he gives a figure of none given that each appeal costs €150. However, I am interested to find out that particular figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Going on his reply to a similar question last July, the Taoiseach indicated and certainly hinted that the Government might respond positively to the Information Commissioner's call for a reappraisal of the €150 charge. According to the commissioner, appeals relating to non-personal information have dropped by 50%. Does the Taoiseach agree that she would have a difficulty in monitoring the working of the Act with such prohibitive charges?</p>

            <p eId="para_15">I do not have the details on these 20 requests. However, since the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act in April 1997, a total of 25 or 2% of requests to my Department have been appealed to the Information Commissioner. In the current period, it is probably smaller. In some cases, people wait a while before they appeal. There were very few appeals, even before the Act was amended.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">The Taoiseach will be aware that the Information Commissioner reported that overall usage of the Act had declined by over 50%, while requests for non-personal information had fallen by 75%. In April 2004, the number of requests came to four compared with ten for both 2003 and 2002. From July to December 2002, 71 requests were made to the Department of the Taoiseach, while in 2003, 34 were made. Is the Taoiseach concerned at the decline in the number of applications? Is he concerned that this may be due to the introduction of charges? Does he intend to allow further flexibility on this matter? Without wanting to know the details of the requests, what was the nature of the 20 applications received? Did they concern factual matters related to the Department?</p>

            <p eId="para_20">The Information Commissioner said that the issue of fees should be examined when it arises next. Obviously, for personal issues it makes no difference, as I have stated on previous occasions. The fee for appeals has a bearing on requests. However, I believe the standard fee of €15 to be charged in respect of non-personal requests does not deter people. If someone wants information for a purpose, it will not make a great difference and is not a major deterrent. It is a modest fee considering the previous costing of the Act some years ago when salaries were much less and it was €425 per question. It is a modest fee. I do not have the breakdown by category for the 20 requests to my Department. My information is for the generality of requests and covers the past six and a half years. There were 79 freedom of information requests from business, 670 from journalists and 57 from the Oireachtas. Most requests were personal.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">The Government appointed Deputy Kitt as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Defence. Deputy Treacy was appointed as Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Deputy Treacy will play a key co-ordinating role in advancing preparations for the ratification of the treaty on the European constitution. He will also play a central role in consolidating and further developing Ireland's positive bilateral EU relations, which were enhanced by our successful EU Presidency, especially with the new member states. In addition to these duties, Deputy Treacy will undertake a heavy workload within the Department of Foreign Affairs through which he will represent Ireland at Minister of State level on European Union affairs, including the Communicating Europe initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">As Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and for the Government's programme of Dáil reform. He oversees preparation of the Government's legislative programme and has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office. The Minister of State has been given the same range of responsibilities for the information society as his predecessor, Deputy Hanafin. Deputy Kitt has responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's strategy for the information society as set out in the policy document, New Connections.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">As Deputies will appreciate, understanding of the challenges of living in an information society and knowledge economy is evolving rapidly. Fortunately, this is also true of our policy response in the areas of infrastructure and the development of e-Government applications. I have decided, therefore, to initiate a review of current arrangements, including those for interdepartmental co-ordination in this area. The review will be informed by a final report from the Information Society Commission, the mandate of which will be complete before the end of this year. Many Ministers have responsibility for direct provision in this area. The Cabinet committee on the information society is part of the framework within which these responsibilities are co-ordinated with the assistance of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. Following the review process, I envisage that new arrangements on co-ordination and advisory requirements will be put in place early in the new year. These arrangements will enable the Government to renew its efforts in this important area.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">Deputy Kitt has been in contact with Opposition Whips on his proposals for Dáil reform. What are the terms of reference for the review of e-Government arrangements? The Taoiseach is aware of the report of the Information Society Commission which was published earlier this month.

That report stated that new generation broadband services are relentless, that Ireland is seriously lagging behind and that we need an additional 300,000 connections. Deputy Durkan has tabled questions about broadband but will the Taoiseach give me the terms of reference for the review and when he expects those to be published? Also, in respect of the Information Society Commission and e-Government, can the Taoiseach confirm that we will move in parallel with the business of wireless connection for broadband purposes?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_28">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_45">To reply to the first question on the responsibilities of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, practically all the Lisbon Agenda items come under either the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or, in many cases, the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">On the second question, it is hoped the final report of the Information Society Commission, Learning to Innovate, will be available before the end of the year. The remit of the Information Society Commission will run out at that time. It has been working for some time now and it has more or less finished its agenda in terms of what it was engaged in. It will issue a report on where it believes we should proceed now and the way we should co-ordinate issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">On the Deputy's question about the areas, there are many Ministers involved. The Minister for Education and Science is involved in the schools aspect of ICT at first, second and third level, particularly the second level programmes. We, in my Department, have been doing a great deal of co-ordination on that in recent years but all the work is on the schools side. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is involved in the mathematics programme moving out from the 19 areas to 67 areas and 123 areas of the country. As the Deputy said, the technology is moving. Even in the past three years I noticed that in many parts of the country the wireless technology was seen as ineffective, or it was considered that it was unrealistic to use it. That appears to be changing because many areas now use it. Also, the people who do the assembly work for the Sky TV box now have the capacity — I am not that knowledgeable on this — to span this out by way of a new product. They claim they can do that throughout most of the country. The range, use and effectiveness of doing this is moving apace and in terms of all the issues that exist it should dramatically change the connections and the fees. The Deputy has probably seen the advertisement by the Sky TV operators in terms of what they charge to do this and the costs are decreasing dramatically. That should extend the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">There are many new areas. I do not want to pre-empt the work of the commission but some members of the commission have raised some issues with me. They say that research is showing the value of ICT and the new ways we can do things. They have highlighted the fact that this typically means innovation in the form of new work practices, skills and organisational structures. We started this seven or eight years ago but it has moved on apace. In the recent statement on broadband and 21st century infrastructure, the commission indicated that successful formulas will tend to be one part technology and nine parts innovation. It is increasingly looking beyond technology to a knowledge-based society. It highlights that it recognises human creativity as the ultimate economic resource and that the ability to come up with new ideas and better ways of doing things are becoming key success factors. Under Sustaining Progress, the Information Society Commission has been overseeing the knowledge society foresight exercise. The commission has worked with the social partners, NESC, Forfás, IDA Ireland and the Higher Education Authority. This exercise has explored the conditions to support and sustain wealth creation in an increasingly innovation-driven global economy by ensuring the costs and the benefits of accelerated change are distributed in an equitable way.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">I do not want to pre-empt the final report but the commission states that there might be a broader way of doing this and, perhaps, more people should be involved in collaboration rather than only a few Departments. The policy should be more inclusive and take in people who do not have access to ICT. It states that a key issue in its work programme is to maintain momentum in the context of Sustaining Progress and shape the appropriate initiatives for taking this forward by ensuring ICT is available to people in more disadvantaged communities. That is happening because, in fairness to many ICT companies, they are providing considerable resources to set up facilities. That perhaps should be in education. One way or the other, as Deputy Kenny said, in regard to the structure that has operated for the past eight years, time has passed that by and I think the commission will recommend a new structure. I do not know what is in the final report but I can see from what these people are saying that a broader initiative is needed than the one that has been in place for the past eight years.</p>

Does the Taoiseach agree with the finding that e-government advances are diminishing both domestically and internationally? Does he concur that social welfare recipients very often find it difficult to access information because they do not have computers? Does the Government intend to make technology more widely available to people accessing social welfare services who do not own or have access to computers and who have no training in this area?</p>

            <p eId="para_54">As I did not anticipate all those questions, I do not have all the answers. However, I will address the general issue and, perhaps, the line Minister will address the specifics later. The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Kitt, chairs the e-government committee. The development of polices in this area continues to be co-ordinated by the information policy unit in my Department and responsibility for implementing those policies rests with the relevant Ministers. The central e-government group includes my information policy unit while CMOD in the Department of Finance was established to address particular issues. It is trying to come to grips with the interoperability and identity management issues. The Government, via the Cabinet committee and the Information Society Commission, has agreed on more than 80 services, which have been identified by individual Departments as on-line priorities. This is growing rapidly. These services have been chosen based on their ability to provide benefits and economic viability. The Deputy asked about the Reach agencies. Reach is working with individual agencies on development of services for on-line delivery in keeping with the stated aim of having the services available by 2005. That is still the aim.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">Subsequent to Government approval, work has commenced on development of a standardised framework for the public service card. The objective of this programme, known as Safe, is to develop a strategy which will enable all public service agencies to deliver token based services to citizens in a co-ordinated way. A steering group is being set up to deal with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">On the issue of e-payments, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance are currently in the process of drafting a memorandum on furthering the use of e-payments for the Civil Service and public service. We are trying to extend that. The Deputy is correct that there are those who do not have these services. The services are still there for people, even for payments. I answered questions on this recently. There are very few people on salaries left who do not use the direct payment system. The same is happening with people looking for services. I do not have the information with me but as far as I can recall enormous numbers of services now use direct payments. It is a bit like what happened with Revenue. It started off very slowly but now approximately 90% of the payments are made on-line. The same is happening even with the smallest of companies and in the agricultural community. That is why broadband is a big issue on the farming agenda, something I welcome. This surprises me a little, but individuals are using the schemes and I welcome what is happening in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">The last area for which I have responsibility is e-Cabinet. Phase one of the e-Cabinet system has been implemented. It went live last May and was officially launched prior to the summer. It provides for authoring and internal processing of all the memoranda in each Department into departmental consultation draft memoranda and for electronic submissions. It is operating and computerising the whole Cabinet secretariat. I do not want to say that everybody is an expert yet, but we are all trying, some like me harder than most. The Cabinet secretariat has been accepting electronic submission of memoranda for Government since June and Departments have been availing of the system on a voluntary basis. Developments are significant. An unplanned example out of the blue was a question which was asked about a memorandum drafted, circulated and submitted on the system some time ago as to what it gained. The gain was that it avoided having to print and deliver 10,000 sheets of paper in the system. Even for some of us sceptics this is a significant benefit. These changes do not happen over night but they are——</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I thank the Taoiseach for his extensive reply, particularly with regard to the responsibilities of the 15 Ministers of State, which presumably explains the €450,000 expenses announced in May 2004 for them. Did he omit one of the responsibilities that was referred to in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of 6 October 2004 which referred to the requirement on Ministers of State to hold clinics for Fianna Fáil backbenchers, apparently on the orders of the Taoiseach? Is that responsibility to be extended to other Members of the House or is it exclusively for Fianna Fáil? Are the Progressive Democrats included in that as well?</p>

Have delegation orders been made in general by Ministers for their Ministers of State since the reshuffle? Regarding the responsibilities of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, in the communicating Europe initiative or, more pertinently, preparing for the referendum, is he part of any co-ordinating network at European level? The first state will hold a referendum on 20 February 2005. The Taoiseach has not been specific but if we are to hold a referendum towards the end of 2005, we would need to be well up and running in the months before the summer to ensure there is no repetition of the experience with the Nice treaty and so on. Will he generally say a word on that area?</p>

            <p eId="para_75">I would be glad to. European Ministers meet more or less on a monthly basis at European level and they co-ordinate their programmes at that level. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has by and large continued the same work and positions as the former Minister of State with responsibility for that area, Deputy Roche. He represents Ireland at all EU meetings at Minister of State level on European issues generally and at other meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">A group within Government meets regularly on European issues. It is not a new development and it concentrates on preparatory work. It has prepared the first document on European issues, which has been circulated widely. It is working on a more extensive document which it is hoped will be produced early in the new year. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is also involved in the preparation work of the referendum commission and co-operates with the parties and the representatives in the Forum for Europe, meeting the education sector and the various elements of the social partners. An extensive programme will commence from the beginning of January.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">I assure Deputy Rabbitte that a great deal of effort and work is taking place. I am trying to get everything completed so that whatever date we ultimately choose will comply with the 90-day rule. We should have all the work completed early at all levels, probably by Easter. I have informed the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and all the people involved who are doing the preparatory work that they should make themselves available from the start of 2005 to give extensive briefings to whatever groups or organisations require them. I also know that many other groups on the "pro" side are making similar plans and, where it is suitable or fits in, the Government will also help them as they are, by and large, non-political.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">In regard to the communicating Europe initiative, I have said frankly to President Barroso that commissioners should be much more active in explaining the benefits of the Commission. If it is not impolite to say so, I suggest that they should put themselves about a bit and explain what they do and how they do it as they are in the best position to do so. I have asked for this to be done extensively in this country, but it should be done everywhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">To the best of my knowledge, the delegation orders to which Deputy Rabbitte referred are complete and most of them are through, although I will have to check.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">Will the Taoiseach advise the House if either Ministers of State in his Department or both have a particular responsibility with regard to the peace process? For instance, we know that the North-South Ministerial Council and the relevant areas of co-operation come under the direct remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs. In that context, has any particular function in the Department of the Taoiseach been allocated to either of the Ministers of State? I acknowledge the experience and role of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, in his previous portfolio. Will the Taoiseach consider widening the roles of his Ministers of State in this area, particularly given that we are hopefully facing the restoration of the institutions and North-South work? In that context, does he believe there is merit in widening the responsibility within his Department and apportioning further responsibility and functions to Ministers of State, given that when — not if — all that is achieved, there will be a responsibility not only on the Government but also on the Oireachtas to step up its activity in this area significantly?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_81">I agree with the Deputy's use of the word "hopefully". No particular responsibility has been assigned but obviously the Ministers of State assist me in North-South, east-west and British-Irish Council work. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has been very active in this work for several years and continues to work closely with me on these issues within the Department, time permitting, because he has an expertise in this area. If we get the institutions up and running again, a number of line Departments will work on North-South issues. We never stopped work on the implementation bodies or in other areas outside them and we will continue with that work.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">If the process gets up and running again, we will step up work in areas in which we have not been able to make progress, not only since the institutions were suspended but since some Ministers, mainly from the Democratic Unionist Party, were not actively engaged in North-South work. It is to be hoped we will not be in such a situation again where a party is effectively in the system but also outside it. It is to be hoped we are not back to that again.</p>

Will the responsibility for EU matters of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, involve him being the director of the Government's referendum campaign on the proposed new EU constitution? What instructions has the Taoiseach given him in that regard? Has he given the Minister of State a date for when he is considering holding the referendum on the constitution? How much notice will the Irish people get so they can have a proper discussion on the matter?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_89">I have given no responsibility at this stage to anybody to direct a campaign. What we are doing, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is co-ordinating in advancing preparations for the ratification of the European constitution. We have not decided on a date but there is a broad timeframe. We know when it must be ratified. Before a referendum takes place, as I told Deputy Rabbitte, we wish to ensure there is a national dialogue on the European constitution based on clear and accurate information. That requires us to do as much work as we can to prepare the ground for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">This constitution contains an enormous amount of helpful and positive provisions, including on the charter of fundamental rights and on issues relating to the social and workers' agenda. These are enormously important as they set out people's rights in a clearer and more transparent way than has been done previously. The constitution will replace all the treaties which have been passed previously. For that reason there is broad support for it, not only in this country but also elsewhere.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_75">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_108">Since the publication of its report in May 2002, the asset management task force has continued its work, following up on the recommendations in that report. The recommendations cover education, regulation and marketing. In particular, the task force has been working to increase the number of chartered financial analysts working in Ireland as a means of attracting further assets for management here. The task force continues to engage actively and regularly with all relevant Departments and State agencies to advance the recommendations in the report.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_76">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_109">Is this the only report that will be published by the asset management task force or can we expect a further report to be published? Have the recommendations made by the task force in respect of education, regulation and marketing been implemented? Are there outstanding recommendations to be implemented? What action will be taken to ensure the International Financial Services Centre maintains its share of the financial services market in the EU and has the potential to secure new business in future years? Will the task force continue to be involved in that?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_77">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_110">I will try to provide as much information as possible. The Society of Investment Analysts engages in dialogue with the educational institutes to assist them in ensuring that their programmes take account of up to date practice in asset management. The society is always trying to broaden its planned marketing campaign of asset management among third level students. As stated previously, this is an area in which there is good employment. There are continuing consultations and exchanges of views between the industry and the various sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">The task force has continued to meet to consider the recommendations contained in the report and has not yet been dissolved. Its membership comprises representatives from the Departments, the agencies and the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">Deputy Kenny's second question related to education. The task force has facilitated a potential increase in the number of students. There are now 91 qualified and certified financial analysts operating in the Irish market. This is a large increase from the position that obtained when this matter was raised last year in the House. Following the report, marketing has been identified as the key objective. Representatives from IDA Ireland are also members of the task force and they identify new opportunities in the context of increasing the number of asset management companies doing business here. The latter has been on the increase. IDA Ireland has been successful in attracting a number of prestigious asset management companies to this country in recent times and is continuing its efforts in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">As regards regulation, IFSRA is also now involved in this area. Taxation was also identified in the report and matters relating to it have now been resolved. The group continues to monitor tax developments in this area. The answer to the Deputy's question is that the areas have been dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">As per the last academic year, 289 students sat the examinations in pursuit of this professional designation. The latest registration statistics point to a similar number doing so next summer. It should be remembered that developments in this area began because there were not enough suitably qualified people in this country to work in it and we were obliged to bring in people and services from outside. Now, however, the numbers of qualified Irish people have risen.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">Deputy Kenny also inquired about the area of business. The most recent estimate indicates that approximately €262 billion worth of assets are under management at the IFSC at present. This enormous figure includes assets managed by members of the Irish Association of Investment Managers of €200 billion, with the other €62 billion managed by other participants and the Central Bank. The figure is increasing all the time. Assets under management on behalf of Irish residents currently stand in excess of €80 billion. There is an increasing trend for the assets of Irish residents to be managed. The asset management industry here is faced with the threat of seepage of assets and that is why it is important to obtain the staff to manage such assets because they will otherwise be managed outside the country. There is some seepage, even though the business is growing.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">The Deputy's final question related to the steps taken to improve activity. Though activity is high, we must continue to do everything to encourage this. IFSRA, which was formally launched last year, is tasked with maintaining the best of the existing system, while also trying to move to a one-stop-shop system for financial services. It will hopefully have a more effective focus on matters relating to consumers' interests. It has instituted a number of initiatives, including the clearing house for the IFSC groups. These groups continue to work to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">This is a growing area in every way, particularly in terms of providing good employment for the increasing number of people entering it. Deputy Kenny will be aware of the benefits of asset management here. Pension funds, for example, are extremely lucrative and there is a significant Bill before the House which is designed to attract more business in this area. People involved in asset management also tend to be involved in other activities and in extending their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">The Deputy is aware of my official position, namely, that I hope the UK will join the euro.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">However, in the event that it does not join, Ireland will get quite an amount work because of the increase in euro-dominated work here. That continues to grow. There is a substantial amount of work in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">Providing world class training for Irish seafarers and increasing Irish seafarer employment are important priorities for this Government. I share the Deputy's concern at the possible consequences for Irish seafarer employment of Irish Continental Group's 20 October 2004 announcement of its plans for restructuring its Ireland-France ferry service. I note that ICG have indicated that it has no plans at present to restructure any of its other ferry operations such as in the Irish Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">Since fiscal relief is important for the development of any EU member state's maritime sector, I recently successfully engaged with my colleagues, the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance, to authorise the reintroduction of the employers of seafarers PRSI refund scheme, with effect from 1 January 2004, for a period of seven years. The scheme, which had ended on 31 December 2003, significantly lowers the cost of employing Irish seafarers and I would expect that this valuable concession will underpin Irish seafarers' employment into the future. With a view to further protecting Irish seafarer employment and Irish-based ship operations, I am reviewing with our shipping sector's dedicated development agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office, the State aids in place for our shipping sector. Irish ship operators should not face competitive disadvantages because of State aids enjoyed by competing ship operators based in other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">A seafarer training grant scheme, administered for the Department by the Irish Maritime Development Office, has recently been restructured to make it more user-friendly. Seafarers who wish to upgrade their qualifications to enhance their career prospects can avail of grant-aid under the scheme. I am confident professional Irish seafarer employment can be maintained into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">Is this not too little, too late? Has the Minister of State considered any action plan to create alternative employment in light of the imminent loss of jobs at Rosslare and the 24-hour strike from Thursday morning, notice of which has been given to the Minister of State?</p>

            <p eId="para_125">This is largely a matter for the private sector. The Government is concerned. It appreciates the importance of the ports and the important service Irish Continental Group and other carriers provide for Irish goods, services and the people. It should be remembered that 99% of Irish goods in volume terms and 86% of goods and services in monetary terms are exported through the ports. I am working in co-operation with my colleague, Deputy Coughlan on this matter, because of the concern expressed by those who are shipping live animals. At the request of my colleagues and of some of the Deputy's colleagues, the Wexford Deputies, I met them following this announcement. I subsequently met them again and representatives of the unions concerned, SIPTU and the Seamen's Union of Ireland and made it abundantly clear that it would have been improper for me to intervene. All I can do is facilitate those meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">At this stage it is not even a matter for the Labour Relations Commission because a matter of principle is involved. This dispute is not a question of financing, time or efficiency but about a principle. The Deputy will be aware of the thinking behind this. Irish Continental Group has informed the Government that this action must be taken to allow the company become more competitive. It also suggests that State aid is given in other countries. My predecessor and I have pursued this possibility. I have written to the Competition Commissioner about this matter. If the evidence is available I would be anxious to pursue the matter vigorously.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">I am quite disappointed that as an island nation, Ireland has not been afforded concessionary terms in order to compete. Brittany Ferries certainly avail of subsidised services. Has the Minister of State any plans to create a task force in Wexford in light of the significant job losses and the little chance of other seafaring jobs there?</p>

            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_128">If Deputy Perry or anyone else can provide me with concrete information about State aids in other countries, I would be delighted to receive it. I am anxious to ensure a level playing pitch, as is everyone in this House. The Deputy is correct, we are an island nation with no land bridge to Europe. It is therefore vitally important that we maintain a sea link and a level playing pitch. Irish Continental Group has proposed to bring in workers from eastern Europe. If the ships are flying the Irish flag, it would be obliged to ensure that minimum wages are paid but the ships will be flying the flag of another country. The Department has examined this matter but it seems we have no jurisdiction over that.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">I am concerned about the escalation of the situation. Thursday's strike has been flagged for some time. The union has approval from its members for industrial action. I understand a 24-hour strike is proposed for Thursday. At the weekend Irish Continental Group decided to cut short the service by five days. Even at this late stage and bearing in mind the importance of the service to the Irish economy I again call on the two unions as there are two unions involved and SIPTU and the Irish Continental Group to enter into meaningful discussions — I am not saying negotiations — with a view to ensuring that the proposed industrial action does not take place.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_136">The Government did not make a proposal to Eircom for a €1.8 billion deal to extend the State's broadband network. Presumably this question arises from a newspaper article of 31 October last to which the Deputy refers and which contends, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Government offered Eircom a €1.8 billion deal to roll out broadband nationally. It also contends that Eircom was offered a range of incentives as “carrots” such as tax breaks, subsidised loans, amendments to the building regulations and price increases. These claims are untrue.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">At no stage were negotiations entered into with Eircom or with any other party. At no stage were terms such as those postulated in the newspaper article on offer nor did the Government offer to fund Eircom directly or indirectly through subsidised loans, tax breaks or any other means. Consultancy advice contained in a report to a Government sub-committee, agency or Department should not be misconstrued as Government policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">The telecommunications market is a regulated market and thus any action by Government has to be consonant with national and EU regulation. Accordingly, the Government is not in the business of entering exclusive contracts of the kind inferred by the article with any market entities. It favours investment in open access infrastructure to which all operators have access on similar transparent terms. That is the ethos behind the Government's open access metropolitan area network programme which is rolling out high-speed broadband infrastructure to 120 towns and cities regionally.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">To the extent that discussions are held between officials of my Department and executives of other telecommunication operators and their representative associations, these were and are born of sound public policy practice and in the context of seeking to align as much as possible the broadband roll-out plans of corporate entities and those of the Government, as published in New Connections and the Government's broadband plans. In that context I commend the telecommunications operators who have contributed significantly to the 80-fold increase in broadband consumers in Ireland in the past 15 months.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_89">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_140">Is it not the case that the substance of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> report is true, that is, the Department’s consultant, Mr. Ira Magaziner, and his company discussed with Eircom a range of incentives, including a 10% price increase, amended building regulations for telecommunications masts, a guarantee of part of the Eircom debt and other attractions to conclude a deal along the same lines as one agreed between the British state and BT for Northern Ireland? Is it not also correct that the negotiations, such as they were, were broken off by Eircom because it wanted to carry out a bond issue of €450 million to repay its venture capitalists?</p>
            <p eId="para_141">Is it not true that the Minister's predecessor was desperate to get an overall roll-out of broadband? Our position in terms of broadband roll-out is appalling. We are at the bottom of the European Union league, with 1.59 households per 100 inhabitants receiving broadband. Does the Government have a target of reaching the European average of households with broadband access — 320,000 households in Ireland — by early 2005? Is it not true that this target will not and cannot be met unless between 6,000 and 8,000 households are broadband enabled each week?</p>
            <p eId="para_142">Did the Minister, on his first appearance at Question Time as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, not accept clear evidence that at least 30% of Eircom lines cannot be enabled for broadband? The company's advertisement, which we hear day in and day out on radio programmes, asking householders to get into the broadband revolution is a sick joke because it is always qualified by the statement that the offer is subject to survey and availability. Is it not true that nearly half of households have no prospect of receiving broadband under this Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_143">Most of what the Deputy said is not true. He asked me if the substance of the question is true. I thought I had made it clear that it is not true, regardless of how much the Deputy tries to twist the facts. As I clearly outlined, there were no negotiations by Government, no deal was put forward by Government and Eircom was not offered by Government a range of incentives such as tax breaks, subsidised loans, amendments to the building regulations or price increases.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">It would be nice if that were the case. I told the Deputy that no negotiations were conducted and no offers were made by Government or anybody. I am aware of because the consultants hired for that purpose were hired by the Department of the Taoiseach and Forfás. They had no right to negotiate on behalf of Government. None of the allegations postulated by the Deputy is true. I emphasise that no negotiations took place and Eircom did not rebuff the Government regarding any package worth €1.8 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">As regards the Deputy's questions concerning broadband, the Government never made any secret of the fact that it was anxious to roll out broadband as quickly as possible. The matter the Deputy raises was part of the process to determine whether we could roll it out any quicker. Ultimately, the Government decided, on foot of the discussions which took place and the presentation made by the consultants, that the best and most effective course of action was that which it had earlier decided, namely, to roll out the municipal area networks and establish group broadband schemes to allow as many people as possible to connect to broadband as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">I am glad the Minister mentioned Forfás and accepted our extraordinary deficit in broadband, perhaps our largest infrastructure failure. Forfás issued a report on broadband last week which noted that Ireland has a broadband deficit of 360,000 households. I informed the Minister on the day he took over the Department that he had been walked into a major scandal by the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Does he accept that Forfás indicates that he has a desperate problem in the area of broadband?</p>

            <p eId="para_154">I am not aware of any national or international health advisory authority which has recommended that the siting of telecommunications masts should result in no direct beam falling on school property. It may be that some paper somewhere has made such a recommendation. If the Deputy can identify any such work I shall have my experts study it, after which I will make a further statement.</p>

It is also the most referenced report ever produced on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">The Stewart report concludes that "it is not possible at present to say that exposure to RF radiation, even at levels below national guidelines, is totally without potential adverse health effects".

Having considered the latest research, all of the bodies have affirmed that there is no adverse health effect shown to be caused by non-ionising radiation at the guideline levels of exposure. The World Health Organisation fact sheet states that these telecommunications facilities are not considered to be a risk to health. Notwithstanding the overwhelming clean bill of health given to these technologies compared to other environmental risks which society willingly accepts, the Government has adopted a precautionary approach. This approach states that absence of proof of harm is not proof of absence of harm. By consensus among many countries, guidelines are established for safe levels of exposure to various kinds of electromagnetic emissions. They are set at levels that are many times less than the experimental levels at which no adverse effects have been established. We have adopted those guidelines in Ireland, especially the guidelines established by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. We continue to participate in the work of the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety, which sets standards in this particular area. ComReg has responsibility to ensure that the various licensed telecommunications operators work within the terms of their licenses regarding electromagnetic emissions.</p>

        <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
        if his attention has been drawn to the ongoing uncertainty in An Post with particular reference to the short term issues of continuity of service throughout the Christmas period and the ongoing issue of the need to retain the postal distribution and delivery network including post offices throughout both urban and rural areas; if he has given any direction in this regard or regarding alternative compatible services which might be complimentary to the postal network; if he can indicate the extent to which he is prepared to influence or direct discussions in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_115" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_175">I am pleased to say that the Labour Relations Commission has facilitated an agreement between An Post and the Communications Workers' Union on appropriate arrangements to deal with the Christmas post. Members of the CWU have voted to renew a general mandate for strike action. Rather than resorting to any form of industrial action, I urge members of the union to work through the established industrial relations machinery to resolve areas of disagreement between management and unions. An Post customers are entitled to a postal service, especially at Christmas and no disruption of postal deliveries should take place at this time of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">An exhaustive process of negotiation between An Post and the CWU has taken place throughout the year on retaining postal distribution and delivery, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. While some progress has been made, there are still many points of disagreement between company management and the union. The union is currently balloting members on proposals that emerged from the negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">The critically important objective of restructuring the company remains an imperative. All parties have agreed that change in the company is necessary if it is to be financially viable and positioned to meet the competitive challenges that can be expected to intensify during the months and years ahead. Management and unions can only achieve the restoration of financial and operational stability by adopting a partnership approach using the services of the State's industrial relations machinery. Unfortunately, I cannot wave a magic wand to provide an easy solution to the difficulties in An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">With regard to the future of the postal network, it is important to note that the sector has changed significantly in recent years with liberalisation of the European postal market and with operators moving from national into international markets. In the development of any new services, the key focus for An Post will be to offer a range of quality products and services which meet consumer demands. The future of An Post future will only be guaranteed by adapting to the increasingly competitive environment in which it operates.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">The post office network has been the subject of a number of studies and reviews in recent years. Many of the recommendations in these reviews have been implemented to win new business, including extra banking and new utility business. The post office network currently has a high footfall, a recognised brand name, and a countrywide retail network. There is scope to build on the range of services already provided and to obtain new business for the network building on existing strengths. I have asked the postmasters' union and An Post to work in partnership with a view to securing existing business and to pursuing new business opportunities as they arise. The parcels market in Ireland is now fully liberalised with some of the biggest postal operators in the world providing high quality services and international reach to Irish business. The competitive nature of the market provides a range of services which largely meet consumer and business needs. The letters market has been partially liberalised, with further EU liberalisation proposals likely to come on stream in the future. Strong international players, currently operating in the parcels sector, are likely to look for opportunities in the letters market. Furthermore, mail is facing a strong challenge from electronic substitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">An Post is equipped to deal with these challenges given its modern infrastructure, well trained staff and established nation-wide reach. Restructuring of the company is a must, together with all stakeholders working together in a partnership approach, if the challenges facing the sector are to be overcome.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_182">I am confused about the issue of continuity of services, which was raised by the Minister. I do not know whether we can expect strike action over the Christmas period or whether it is resolved as the Minister seemed to indicate at the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">The SDS service is due to cease in the next few days. Can the Minister indicate whether he is aware of the serious risk to hundreds and thousands of jobs around the country as a result of the non-availability of this service? How does he expect it to be replaced by alternatives, particularly if we are attempting to find out how best to enhance the services at An Post by expanding the degree to which it can serve the public? There appears to be a multiplicity of issues currently facing An Post including poor labour relations, the SDS service to which I have referred, outstanding issues on wages, pensions, delivery of services and the future of the postal services, especially post offices and the integral role they play in the community.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_184">The issue on arrangements for Christmas has been resolved in the Labour Relations Commission, so that is out the way. There are a couple of other ballots taking place within the union on the general restructuring of An Post. I do not know what the result of those will be. The union executive had its mandate renewed for a general strike, which is separate from the Christmas issue, so I do not know whether that mandate will be acted upon. The issues will not be resolved by strikes, nor by people not talking to one another. They will not be resolved by megaphone diplomacy nor by people calling on the Minister to intervene in favour of one side or the other. Neither side will get that kind of comfort. The outstanding issues will be resolved when people sit down and start to realise that there will be full liberalisation of this country's postal service — it will be totally open to competition — in approximately four years. When customers are given that freedom, they will decide who is the most effective and efficient provider of a quality service.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_187">People on both sides of this debate need to focus on that. Both sides have agreed that SDS will be dealt with by the national implementation body. It is being dealt with by the body and it should be allowed to stay at that level. I do not want to say anything that might give offence on the one hand or succour on the other hand. The implementation body is the proper place for that. I wish to speak generally about SDS rather than about anything specific to its activities. The level of competition changed over two years when the market was liberalised. A better, more efficient and more effective service was provided after international logistics companies were taken over by postal services from other countries. That will happen in the letter post sector in 2009 if we fail to get our act together. I am not taking sides, but I appeal to both parties involved to acknowledge what we face. If we are to restructure the company, which both sides agree is necessary for its future survival, we cannot afford to engage in a 12-month stand-off.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_188">In the circumstances, is the Minister prepared to indicate to the relevant parties, privately if not publicly, the desirability of recognising the need for change? If multinational logistics corporations can organise delivery services, it should be possible for us to compete effectively. Will the Minister bear in mind the social and economic impact of losing internal control of such vital services? Will he consider the best way to ensure that other services which complement the postal service, such as delivery services, will continue to be provided throughout the country? The need for such services has been referred to on numerous occasions in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_189">I agree with the Deputy that the message to which he referred needs to be transmitted. I have met the management of An Post and the IPU. I will convey the message in question to the CWU loudly when I meet its representatives at an appropriate time, when all the industrial relations votes are out of the way. I intend to meet the full board of An Post to convey the message. The Deputy is right to state that it is a vital service. I would prefer An Post to continue to provide it well into the future, rather than getting outside agencies to do it for us.</p>

        <b>Mr. Eamon Ryan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
        the implications for the Government of the decision of the European Court of Justice on 18 November 2004 regarding our failure as a member state to fulfil obligations under the Community system for fisheries regulations regarding the exceeding of fishing quotas.
        [31529/04]
      </p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_123" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_191">The Deputy's question refers to the European Court of Justice's judgment on a number of cases of Irish fish quotas being exceeded in 1995 and 1996. The details of the judgment are being examined in detail by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The European Commission has asked Ireland to indicate, by 22 January 2005, details of the measures that have been taken or will be taken to address the issues raised by the judgment. The Department will complete its examination of the issue as a matter of urgency and a detailed response will be issued to the Commission before the January 2005 deadline. The Department's response will focus on the additional fisheries control measures that have been developed and implemented since the mid-1990s to address the system deficiencies which led to the over-fishing cases in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">I stress the great importance Ireland attaches to complying with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. Such compliance, which is a priority objective of the Department, has underpinned major changes and improvements in the fisheries control and enforcement regime in recent years. It is not possible to provide precise details of the implications of the judgment. Discussions with the Commission will be held at the earliest possible date to secure the necessary clarification on this and other issues which arise. Ireland will assure the Commission that many improvements have been undertaken or are in train to enhance Ireland's fisheries control and enforcement regime.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_124">
            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_193">The Minister of State cannot provide details of the implications of the judgment, but can he tell me what the cost implications will be when we have to pay for the cases which, as he has correctly stated, relate to the mid-1990s? If the Government is concerned to ensure that there is proper monitoring and control, as the Minister of State has suggested, why did the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources fail to respond when it was asked in March 2001 to provide a response on behalf of the Government? Does the Minister of State agree that this case characterises the Irish fishing industry and the Department as being primarily concerned with allowing small sectional interests to plunder the sea, especially when considered alongside recent scandalous revelations which appear to be coming to light about widespread ignoring of the current quotas and malpractice within the industry?</p>
            <p eId="para_194">The European Court of Justice's judgment, which shames the Department and Ireland as a whole, requires measures which are much more radical than those taken by the Department, which ignored the original judgment of March 2001, which is not that long ago. It did not answer any of the important questions about Ireland's failure to oversee the quotas which were being applied, to prosecute the vessels which were seen to exceed quotas or to monitor the overseas activity by Irish vessels. The judgment catalogues Ireland's remarkable failure to show concern about conservation or to apply the fishing quotas, which are in place for a reason.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_125" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_195">Costs have been awarded against Ireland in this instance. It is not possible to estimate the final costs at this point. The matter can be discussed with the Commission later, at an appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">I caution the Deputy for his reference to "recent scandalous revelations". I repeat the comments of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who said in the House when the matter was initially raised that the case is under investigation. It is a question of innocence first and proving guilt afterwards. I would not like to say anything that might affect the case in any way. I do not think anybody should draw any conclusions until the investigation has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">The House should know that there was over-fishing of cod in the Arctic and in area 2 in 1996. The level of over-fishing in that instance comprised 0.4% of the total allowable catch and 0.2% in another case. It comprised 7.8% of the total allowable catch in a case relating to haddock in area 7. The angler fish quota was exceeded by 0.8%, the red fish quota was exceeded by 0.2% and the common sole quota was exceeded by 5.9% in area 7a. I do not suggest that quotas should be exceeded, but we should put it in perspective — we are talking about issues which arose in 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">Our primary focus will be on assuring the Commission that our enhanced system addresses the issues satisfactorily. While a significant proportion of reporting was conducted manually ten years ago, when the over-fishing in question took place, state-of-the-art IT systems are now in place to assist those involved. Our licensing regimes have been strengthened and increased and quotas have been tightened. The satellite surveillance that has been installed in the form of vessel monitoring systems is an important part of the current control regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">It is no harm to remind the House that many EU member states are being questioned about over-fishing. Denmark faces ten such cases at present, Spain faces nine cases, Belgium and the United Kingdom face seven cases each, Sweden faces six cases and Ireland and Portugal face five cases each. Deputies should not be under the impression that Ireland, which has 4.6% of the total European catch, is the only country involved in such cases. The question of whether Ireland has engaged in over-fishing will be dealt with by the courts. We will respond within the two-month window of opportunity we have been given. I think our response will satisfy the Commission.</p>

            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_200">I would like to ask a brief supplementary as the Minister of State has not answered my question. The Minister of State reiterated the case made by the Government to the European Court of Justice and said that the amount involved is small and has since been changed. The court rejected those arguments and said that the Government had shown a disregard for the implementation of the regulation. Why has Ireland still not implemented some of the changes clearly required given that the breach was recorded ten years ago? Why has it taken ten years to implement the changes? The Minister of State said — I hope he is right — that some of the current allegations will prove to be unfounded.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_127" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_201">I did not say that. The Deputy has rephrased what I said.</p>

            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_202">I apologise, the Minister said that one has to be careful. Will he agree that the dogs in the street — perhaps mackerel in the bay would be more appropriate in this case — are aware of this? The approach of the industry, the Department and the Government has been characterised as that of willing to bend the rules, stretch quotas and push as much as possible to try to get fish landed and sold. That is not good enough. We need to go back to a conservation agenda which will provide us with a long-term future. That is not what is occurring and stocks are depleting rapidly.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">It was suggested by a departmental official at a recent committee meeting that Ireland might have to separate the development function in terms of the fishing industry and the monitoring function within this Ministry. There has been a flagrant breach of the quota, regardless of size, and Ireland has been found guilty by a European court in every case. Does that not provide an unanswerable case for the separation within the Department of the development of fisheries and the monitoring role?</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_136" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_217">I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 98, 125, 140, 141 and 145 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">Up to early 2003 the telecommunications market, although fully liberalised, had been slow to invest in the necessary infrastructure to keep pace with the demand for broadband. In March 2002 the Government set out its aim of placing Ireland within the top 10% of OECD countries for broadband connectivity within three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">Recognising that the lack of high-speed infrastructure would deny us that goal, the Government set aside an indicative €200 million under the NDP for infrastructure developments that would enable the provision of services by the private sector. The creation of high-capacity backbone infrastructure and metropolitan area networks, MANs, are the cornerstones of the programme. Some 19 MANs have been completed and seven more are under construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">In the next phase of the programme broadband networks will be rolled out in more than 90 towns with a population of 1,500 or more. The MANs are being managed for the State on an open access basis and offer private sector telecommunications providers wholesale rates for band width that are on a par with the best available in Europe. The group broadband scheme, introduced by my Department earlier this year, enables smaller towns and rural communities to come together with the service providers and, with funding assistance of up to 55% from my Department, obtain broadband connectivity using the most suitable technology. Considerable interest is being shown in the scheme with applications submitted by more than 50 communities to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">The availability of broadband is increasing. Telecommunications companies are vigorously marketing digital subscriber line, DSL, broadband in all areas, while other broadband technologies such as satellite, wireless and cable are all growing in popularity. The number of broadband customers is growing by more than 30% per quarter and has increased 80-fold in the past year to over 105,000 customers today.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">Other countries are also actively pushing the broadband agenda and that will make our targets more difficult to reach. However, we have seen significant progress in 2004 in terms of increased broadband penetration and I am satisfied that the conditions are in place to see this rate of progress sustained through 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_223">I realise the Minister is new to this portfolio but, notwithstanding that and keeping in mind his admission that we are not up to the originally anticipated speed, what is the root cause of the slow investment in infrastructure? Will the Minister indicate why Ireland is falling further behind, notwithstanding that these warning signals have existed for the past two or three years, during which time I and other Members have tabled questions on the issue? Will the Minister indicate whether the methods now being used to expand broadband services throughout the country are the most cost effective, efficient and sustainable, with greater emphasis on sustainability? For example, is adequate use being made of wireless technology as a means of providing to a wider group of consumers the most up-to-date services in terms of broadband availability?</p>
            <p eId="para_224">Will the Minister indicate whether MANs and some of the other systems now in operation are to some extent old technology? Given that technology has a relatively short lifespan, will he give the House an indication of the degree to which the most modern technology is being used in the expansion and provision of the services referred to?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_225">The reason for the slow roll-out of infrastructure was that Eircom, the company with the most exchanges and so on, did not afford it the same degree of priority as the Government — it had other priorities. Deputy Broughan said that at a time when we were looking to Eircom for the fast roll-out of broadband, rather than investing in broadband, it borrowed money to pay dividends and shares to its shareholders. That is no great secret. There is no point crying over spilled milk. There was no competition and, given Eircom's position, there was a slow start to the roll-out of broadband. As I outlined in my reply, that position has been accelerated.</p>
            <p eId="para_226">To be fair to Eircom, it is now committed to reaching the target of 400,000 connections by the end of 2006. I have asked Eircom and others to be more ambitious and to try to achieve 500,000 connections, but it has indicated it will take until 2007 to reach that target. I believe, with the roll-out of schools' broadband, the MANs projects and the group schemes, that the target of 500,000 will be reached in 2006. That is the history on this issue. It is my view based on the information available regarding why Ireland has not been as fast as other countries to take off in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_231">I was aware from the schools projects and so on that we were much further behind. We are not falling further behind but are catching up. In 18 months, it has risen from 10,000 subscribers in March 2003 to 105,000. The number of connections is increasing at 30% per quarter, so we are not falling behind.

            <p eId="para_235">That is a good description.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">The metropolitan area networks are a fibre optic network, which, I am told by all technical experts, gives unlimited bandwidth. The type of technology used at the end of these networks by the various service providers is a matter for them. I do not have great knowledge of what specifically they are doing. However, many new technologies are coming into the area such as WiMAX, wireless and satellite. The increasing divergence of methods for providing broadband throughout the country will help in reaching our targets. Nationwide coverage will be achieved by 2007.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_237">I hate to disagree with the Minister. However, regarding the revised targets, does he accept that excavations required for cabling are more complicated and costly than the use of wireless technology? Wireless technology can be used to a far greater extent to expand the facilities available for the fibre optic networks. The combination of both will give a far broader service to communities than just a fibre optic network on its own. Why did the then Minister not give a direction on the investment of infrastructure five years ago when it should have taken place? In two months' time if the provision of broadband facilities, as anticipated in the Minister's projections, is not coming up to speed, will he give such a direction?</p>

            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_238">Is it the policy of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to give every household a broadband connection? If so, what is the time frame? Is the basic policy similar to the electricity roll-out in the 1930s and 1940s?</p>
            <p eId="para_239">The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, called all the Opposition spokespersons to Government Buildings to inform us there was market failure in this area. Will the Minister agree that there has also been regulatory failure? As the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was Minister for Education and Science, will first year students in 2005 receive a laptop computer? If so, we could begin to be an IT-enabled society. Will the Minister take major steps such as this to drive IT infrastructure development, which he agreed is a disaster?</p>

            <p eId="para_240">Is duplication occurring with the development of the metropolitan area networks between State and private infrastructures? Does the Minister believe it should be developed as a separate physical network or is there a case for integrating State and private infrastructures?</p>

            <p eId="para_241">The greater the variety of means to provide broadband, the better. However, all means, such as wireless, satellite, coaxial, cable and copper pair, are now being used. There is that mix of means as referred to by the Deputy. The slowness in rolling out the infrastructure in comparison to the UK is because the UK has an existing extensive cable network that Ireland does not have. The Government's policy is to roll out broadband and to have 100% penetration throughout the country.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_251">I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well in the delicate negotiations, which are at a sensitive stage, in respect of the Good Friday Agreement. I sincerely hope these sensitive discussions will have a successful conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I want to raise the serious implications of the decision handed down today by the Special Criminal Court. A person, with a close association with a Member, was convicted of IRA membership, conducting the dual role of Dublin IRA brigade intelligence officer and that of an election agent for a Sinn Féin Deputy. When this matter was raised in 2003 the Taoiseach said this was rubbish and the situation did not exist. When did the Taoiseach become aware from intelligence briefings that the surveillance of movements of Members from both his party and mine was actively put under way by the persons concerned? I understand that up to 20 Members were not informed by the appropriate authorities that this surveillance of movements, observation or spying, was being conducted? Why have Members had to read this in the newspapers? This activity took place when the IRA was on ceasefire yet those convicted were on active duty. Will the Taoiseach confirm that they will not be released under any terms of the Good Friday Agreement?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_160">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_253">I do not have any more details than Deputy Kenny. I understand that two men, Niall Binéad and Ken O'Donohoe, were today convicted and sentenced to four years for membership of the Provisional IRA. I do not recall that I am on record saying this was rubbish.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">As I remember it, there were a few events around the same time involving the observation of certain activities by an off-duty garda who thought the persons involved were watching his home. In this case, a normal Garda patrol subsequently came across a van in which people were found. I recall the robbery of a pub in north Dublin in which a significant number of people engaged in establishing road-blocks. The manager of the pub was kidnapped from his home. A number of similar incidents occurred at the same time.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">What kind of activity was it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_162">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_256">It was severe, criminal activity. I do not recall ever saying these cases were nonsense. People were arrested and charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Deputy Kenny asked when I had knowledge that information was gathered about a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Finance and other Deputies. I was not given the information in a security briefing until the court cases were held. Obviously, it is a very serious matter that people were engaged in gathering information on Members of the elected assembly of the Houses of the Oireachtas for criminal, paramilitary or whatever other purposes. It is being dealt with by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The issue of the involvement of the accused in activities prior to April 1998 does not arise in the context of the release of prisoners under the Good Friday Agreement. The individuals concerned will serve their sentences as have over 40 others who have been arrested and sentenced for paramilitary and criminal activities over the last number of years. The imprisonment of these people represents the success of the Garda special units which have been working to counter their activities. That is my information.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">To be very clear, I have never seen a detailed security briefing on what these individuals were really about.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_260">The Taoiseach assures the House that he never saw an intelligence briefing on this matter. The Garda only became aware of it after a Deputy and the party involved rang the Garda station in Bray on two occasions to inquire about the person who was the second to be convicted of IRA membership in the case under discussion. The Deputy rang the station on the assumption that the first-named person had been arrested. The story appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 26 January last year, at which stage the Taoiseach said he knew nothing about a spying operation. The matter was then dropped. Am I to understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was not aware of the matter? If one reads between the lines of replies or comments by the Minister to a Sinn Féin Deputy last year, it appears he might have known from intelligence briefings what was going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Can the Taoiseach inform the House whether the intelligence gathered by the Army and the Garda is being made available to the International Monitoring Commission to inform their brief on the activities of the IRA? The Taoiseach will recall that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said last year that the Provisional IRA was involved in criminal activity in Dublin Port. Does the Taoiseach consider that the International Monitoring Commission should be provided with information on the activities of members of the IRA in the Republic? If the members have been convicted in this jurisdiction, they are obviously operating here. I say that without wishing to infringe in any way on the current, sensitive events surrounding the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_164">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_262">I accept completely what Deputy Kenny says. I do not consider the issues to be related either. While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform always has knowledge of security initiatives, I am aware of them in the context of Northern Ireland. I am not aware of normal issues occurring here. If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had raised any of these issues when the people in question were charged, it would have been completely inappropriate. It would have affected a conviction through the legal system. Whether the Minister knew or not, it would have been inappropriate to raise the matter in the House. As has happened on previous occasions, reference to the matter here would have been used to try to help Niall Binéad and his colleague, Kenneth Donohoe, to avoid prosecution for the serious offences in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I had no information other than what has come out in court and do not to this day. Apparently, the two men and perhaps others associated with them had documents relating to a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the movements of Dáil Members. The information outlined in the courts refers to very serious offences which, as Deputy Kenny correctly says, have nothing to do with current events.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The activities of these people and the question of why they should have been gathering such information is a serious matter. The men have been sentenced to four years imprisonment for their activities, but I still do not know what the motive for tracking, following and detailing the activities of Members of this House. It remains to be proven what it was all about. It should be remembered that the sentences were imposed for IRA membership, which does not resolve the issue of information gathering.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">Without checking, a distinction is made between those who committed offences prior to 10 April 1998 and those who have done so since then. People who have committed offences since 10 April 1998, of whom there are many, have not been able to avail of the provisions of the Agreement. At last count, approximately 40 people were imprisoned, many of whom are serving very long sentences.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_267">I remind the Taoiseach that on the most recent Private Members' debate, the Labour Party proposed a review of the M3 route. We raised the matter as a national monument of international significance is at risk while acknowledging fully the need to provide the hard-pressed commuters from Meath towns with more speedy access to this city, which is usually their place of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I note in one of today's newspapers the description by Deputy Haughey, Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Local Government, of any attempt to push ahead with the M3 as an action bordering on vandalism. His view is representative of the widening base of acknowledgement that it would be foolhardy to press ahead with the current route if for no other reason than that it is likely to be litigated for years. We have had many experiences in this area since the Wood Quay development. We are now confronted with a scenario in which the admitted discovery of 38 sites means it is expected to make a significant archaeological find every 370 m along the proposed route. One does not have to be Einstein to realise this will mean a prolonged delay which will help nobody from Kells, Navan or Dunshaughlin to access the city more quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">People who see adherence to the proposed route as the quickest way to build a road will find out after we have been bogged down in litigation for ten years that it will still not be built. Is not that a very good reason for the Government to take a pragmatic view? While the opportunity still exists, the Government should review the proposed road, provide an alternative route for hard-pressed commuters and, above all, protect a monument which contains our Celtic past?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_168">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_270">I was asked this question when dealing with infrastructural questions recently and I stated that, despite all that has happened, the archaeological digs are continuing. I understand there is a six-metre trench in the area. There are spurs off that trench and a large number of people are working on it to determine its significance. The Government cannot make a call on it until it receives all the reports. There are those in the National Roads Authority and within the council system who say the number of finds so far is in line with the number that would be made on any other stretch of road, although I cannot make a call on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Deputy Rabbitte is correct. A concerted campaign is under way expressing misgivings centring on the impact of the construction of the M3 on the site chosen by the NRA. They say this will affect the cultural heritage of the landscape the proposed road passes and that this will be compounded by the delay in getting major archaeological reports on it. The scheme was approved with modifications by An Bord Pleanála in August 2003, no High Court objection to the board's decision was made and the scheme became operational on 24 September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Questions were raised at that time about alternative routes to the east of the Skryne Valley. That has been advocated. It is said that this route would have a significant impact on the local community, farms and over 200 houses. The eastern route would also entail a high level bridge crossing the Boyne, giving rise to significant visual intrusion. The landscape architect who assessed the visual impact in the EIS stated at the oral hearing that he considered that the proposed M3, including the Blundelstown interchange, would not visually impinge on the sensitive landscape surrounding the national monuments. He put forward various montages to show why that was the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Deputy Rabbitte is correct because a head of steam has now built up on this issue, as often happens, and I will not try to call it until we receive archaeological advice on it. If there were an easy route, right or left——</p>

          <p eId="para_326">My question is on the minds of many people in Dublin, Ireland and beyond these shores. What can be done to avert the demise of Bewley's cafes? I was sitting in Bewley's the other day thinking of the Taoiseach's recent description of himself as a socialist. He also referred to how he valued the Botanic Gardens because he felt he owned them and he valued Dublin Zoo in a similar vein. If he were in the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney or Parknasilla, he would have the same warm feeling of being part of the action and part of the ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The Crown Bar in Belfast is effectively in public ownership. It is owned by the National Trust and managed by Bass Ireland, which the Taoiseach will be delighted to hear. The National Trust made a decision to purchase that exotic property in 1978 with the encouragement of Sir John Betjeman, the late Poet Laureate. The work carried out on the property in 1981 cost £400,000. The bar was restored to what is regarded internationally as a visual gem and it is a major tourist attraction.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Will the Taoiseach acknowledge the intrinsic value of Bewley's cafés, which face the prospect of becoming clothes shops on Grafton Street? He earlier referred to how interested he is in heritage. Bewley's is not only a café but it is "Dublin's front room", as one journalists described it. It is on the site of the school attended by Robert Emmet, Thomas Moore, Richard Sheridan and the Duke of Wellington. The café has been frequented by Joyce, Behan, Flann O'Brien and Mary Lavin. Will the Taoiseach consider the possibility of the Government entering an arrangement to ensure the café can continue as a social amenity and viable business, given that is an immense asset to the city as well as the State? He should not listen to everything the Tánaiste tells him.</p>

Will they continue to serve both tourism and the economy generally in the same way Bewley's did down the years? Given that pension funds are being invested overseas, in some cases dubiously, does such an institution not warrant the investment the State could bring to bear, given that the Taoiseach thought it worthy to invest €50 million in Farmleigh House? It is an expensive bed and breakfast at that price. Does Bewley's not have a more legitimate claim on State investment? Such investment is not unique and it has been successful internationally. Would the Taoiseach be open to discussions with the owners and others who have campaigned to franchise the cafés or use them to promote the history and culture in Dublin? If Farmleigh House is justifiable, why not Bewley's?</p>

          <p eId="para_352">In respect of Nos. 9 and 10, the Fine Gael Party has put forward the view for some time that the process leading to the presentation of the budget is not as it should be. Deputies from all sides and parties should have the opportunity to discuss Estimates in a real way, with the opportunity to recommend changes in and transfers within Votes so that the public gets the greatest transparency and accountability in terms of moneys being voted through on its behalf. On that basis, I oppose Nos. 9 and 10.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">In respect of Vote No. 26, for example, which deals with the Department of Education and Science, the note given to the Whip, for which we are grateful, says that the Department has managed its budget prudently this year.

The note says the Department's budget was managed prudently and that €50 million was not spent. However, if we look at the parliamentary questions asked today on education, the majority relate to school buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Vote 35 is for €20 million in respect of the sports capital programme under subhead C1. What is this? Why have the committee and its members not had an opportunity to discuss the allocation of this €20 million, which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, may read out tomorrow? Communities around the country would be very interested in the matter. From that perspective, I do not accept the lead up to this budget has been as it should be if we are to be a responsible Oireachtas and if we are to have a Government that spends the people's money in as transparent and accountable a way as possible. For that reason, I oppose Nos. 9 and 10.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">It seems habitual that we have a logjam coming up to the budget. Is it necessary? We seem to have something like the Naas dual carriageway of Votes that are back to back and must be taken together in a brief period of time. The prospect of debating them, where necessary, in this House is then seen as completely impractical. It appears to be designed to be that way rather than that it is a requirement and that it is almost an habitual reflex action in the Department of Finance. Is that how it is and is it open to change?</p>
          <p eId="para_370">We have a similar rush with motion No. 11. It is proposed we take a number of matters here all together. There is a need for the fisheries issue to be debated in this House. There is quite an appalling demise in fish stocks and a significant safety issue exists for fishermen. I need to know whether the Government realises that this is an issue that needs wider debate than just in committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">I have no doubt that the Supplementary Estimates are required. My concern is the methodology of dealing with them, particularly as an active member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and as a Member who participates in debate covering a raft of these areas. Six different Departments are affected. The question raised by the Deputies is reasonable and fair. The situation is difficult for Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I warrant that, if we go back over the past 12 months, there have been other Supplementary Estimates for one or more of those Departments since the Book of Estimates and the budgetary measures were introduced last December. This is a difficult area.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Will the Taoiseach take on board that there is a failure on the part of Departments to project and provide properly for their needs on an annual basis? We talk about introducing multi-annual budgeting, yet we appear not to be able even to budget and provide properly on a 12-month basis, which must be of concern. I register that concern but have no doubt that the moneys sought under the headings outlined are required.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_374">The process we have adopted and streamlined over the years and operate currently has improved significantly in the past decade. The Book of Estimates is produced on the third Thursday of November and the revised Book of Estimates comes out in the spring. It is debated in detail in committees which Ministers attend and where all issues are raised. It was never debated on a subhead basis in this House since the foundation of the State, but this is now done in committees where committee members can raise questions and other Members can attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">If, for different reasons, changes are required in the subheads because expenditure is being moved within a Vote or there is a requirement for additional expenditure to be voted, which is now rare, this is also discussed in committee. We have moved to multi-annual funding in the past year, so we are not losing expenditure due to delays for different reasons. Supplementary expenditure issues are explained in committee. It is a full and transparent process.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I accept in good faith what Deputy Kenny said, namely, that he thinks the process could be improved. This side of the House is only too glad to discuss all these issues in terms of Dáil reform. The Opposition knows our view. If we are to have a debate on these issues, it will be on the totality and not just on one issue. We await constructive debate on this and will be glad to have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I share the Deputy's view that we could improve some of the procedural structures of this House. Let us do that or we will not otherwise make any changes. The Government Whip is ready and waiting to have meaningful dialogue on these issues. The Estimates process is a good process and all we ask is that the debate on these matters can take place in committee where everything will be explained.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">Arising from the legislation on the Good Friday Agreement, will the Taoiseach comment on the choreography in respect of the conclusion of the Northern Ireland talks? Obviously, I do not want the Taoiseach to outline any of the details of which he is aware but perhaps he will indicate to the House the timescale and run-off of the events which will I hope surround a successful conclusion to these talks.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">I thank Deputy Kenny for raising the issue in this form. My assessment, following the meetings I had today with Sinn Féin and that Prime Minister Blair had with the DUP, is that there are still a number of issues, although I hope not too many, on both sides. They are not necessarily the same issues — some of them overlap — but we have further work to do on them. I hope we can make progress on them over the next 48 to 72 hours. The parties must then consult and in some cases reconsult with their constituencies on the progress we have made and see if they agree or disagree.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">At this stage, I would not like to be overly positive or overly negative. Some people say I tend to sometimes speak negatively on some of these issues, which I accept, but my assessment is that there are still some potentially difficult items, to some of which I do not readily see a quick solution. Therefore, I am not prepared to call it until I see those solutions. There are at least two items which concern me and to which I do not see a short-term solution unless people significantly move their position.</p>

The House will not have a debate on the Fisheries (Miscellaneous Commercial Licences) (Alteration Duties) Order 2004. The Maritime Safety (No. 2) Bill deals with an issue of increasing importance given that safety at sea is becoming more difficult due to the need for trawlers to spend longer at sea, making less money, not being able to carry out necessary maintenance and, ultimately, taking risks. Can that legislation be fast tracked, as there is no indication of a date for publication?</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_695">As the expression goes "Like a hole in the head". Amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 29 are to be taken together. My concern is that while the Minister is doing the right thing in reducing the conditions for naturalisation, he is giving a rather narrow interpretation of what the phrase "Irish associations" means. He is limiting the situation relating to naturalisation by investment which was a questionable procedure widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. In some cases it led to questions about the desirability of some of the persons and some of the procedures used. In the process, the Minister is now giving a narrower interpretation to "Irish associations". It would unduly limit proper associations with Ireland by Irish ancestry, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The Bill refers to citizens who are alive. It defines Irish associations solely in terms of blood relationship affinity and that is a relationship by marriage — I have tabled an amendment relating to partnership — or adoption to an Irish citizen or a person who, if alive, would have been an Irish citizen. This suggests that anybody of Irish descent pre-1922, for instance, the descendants of Robert Emmet, would not be entitled to Irish citizenship except purely at the discretion of the Minister. They are not qualified under the terms of Irish associations. It might be hit or miss whether they would be the beneficiaries of that discretion. This is an unnecessarily narrow interpretation of Irish associations. There was a time when the interpretation of Irish associations was so broad that virtually everybody on the planet would be entitled to apply if they had ever come in contact with an Irish person. This proposal seems to lean too far in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Any person who has made a significant contribution to the academic, social or cultural life of Ireland, other than a contribution in the nature of an investment, a financial contribution, would have a valid reason for having an Irish association and this is stated in my amendment. Significant numbers of people have made substantial contribution over the years. They have come to Ireland and contributed to academic life and to the literary, cultural, social and sporting life of the nation. Rather than the exceptional case of Jack Charlton applying for Irish citizenship because of his contribution in the sporting arena and being awarded it at the discretion of the Minister for Justice at the time, there should be a more amenable and accessible mechanism to allow a person to argue the case on certain criteria of contribution to Irish society, life and culture. We should have pride in our citizenship. We should be proud that those who contributed to the life of the nation are entitled to an avenue to Irish citizenship which is not solely at the whim of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The interpretation is extra narrow. I agree that the Minister is correct to rule out once and for all the idea of naturalisation by financial investment, but he is not correct to narrow the interpretation to such a degree as to exclude the categories of persons to which I referred. I refer the Minister to the list of 2,000 Argentinians which I mentioned on Committee Stage. These Argentinians of Irish descent wrote to the Minister but because their Irish descent was at the degree of their great-grandparents, they were deemed not to be entitled to any criteria that would allow them to establish citizenship. It is a shame that there is not some avenue that could be used for them. Avenues exist for people who have never visited the country and have no intention of visiting it. The Argentinians who wrote to the Minister stated that not only did they wish to visit the country but they also wished to work here. They wished to apply for work permits as the economy in Argentina was in rag order a number of years ago. They may not all have wished to work here but some of them were of bona fide Irish descent and were proud of their Irish origins. There should be some means available by which they could agree to adhere to the criteria laid down and then apply for and be granted citizenship. They may be granted citizenship at the whim of the Minister but that is the height of it. I believe it is too narrow an interpretation and I ask the Minister to revisit the issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_699">It is very useful to have this debate. I compliment Deputy Costello on tabling these amendments. The first thing that occurs to me regarding citizenship is that there should be clarity in our stance on the issue. There should no longer be room for an approach such as was adopted on Irish associations to allow the introduction of the passports for sale scheme. I will leave the issue of that scheme to one side for the moment as it is the subject of the next amendment. It was introduced by the back door under the guise of being an Irish association. It was considered to be an Irish association if somebody made a major investment in this country. That brought the chickens home to roost in the debate on the original Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill in the 1950s.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">It is agreed that no such scheme will exist in the future, but what will exist? The Minister provides in the Bill that it will be specified that a person is of Irish associations if he is related by blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is, or is entitled to be, an Irish citizen. In many ways Deputy Costello is trying to broaden the definition and I understand his argument. My approach is slightly different. I wish to see more clarity on the issue. The manner in which the Bill is framed shows an absence of clarity. What do the phrases "relationship by blood", "relationship by affinity" and "relationship by adoption" mean? I do not believe it is useful to leave the wording in that fashion. It may be over-straining the issue to put it as Deputy Costello stated, that it is being left to the whim of the Minister, but there is much truth in his argument. I do not think it appropriate that definitions relating to such a serious matter should be left on the Statute Book without knowing how the provisions will operate in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I understand the issue of the Argentinians raised by Deputy Costello. They probably do not feel too good after last Saturday's match when Ronan O'Gara did the business in the last 30 seconds. That is a separate issue but it raises the question of the Irish diaspora and descendants of those who went to South America many years ago and who retain their connections and bonds with this country. While I am not sure they were shouting for Ireland on Saturday, I understand the desire of many of them to be able to build on their links to Ireland and, in some circumstances, re-establish that citizenship. What will be the position in this regard under the provisions of this section? Is it a matter for the Minister of the day to make a decision? Clarity is required and the Minister should provide it. What guidelines will apply in the interpretation of this provision?</p>
          <p eId="para_702">This underlines a much broader issue that arises on the question of immigration. I have no idea what is the policy on many aspects of immigration and citizenship. They are connected to a degree given that an Irish citizen is entitled to come here at any time and work, whereas a person without citizenship is not so entitled. This is one aspect of our policy or lack of it on the general issue of immigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">It is incredible and unacceptable that a person who applies for citizenship and submits all the relevant documentation, having lived here for five years, is told that he or she must wait for a further two years before the application is even considered. The law provides that citizenship is available to those who have lived and worked here for five years, abided by the law and so forth. In such circumstances, it is not acceptable that, through administrative neglect, the response from the Minister's office to such an applicant is that he or she must wait a further two years. There is no provision in law for such a response. Irrespective of whether it arises through incompetence, mismanagement or otherwise, it is not acceptable and must be addressed immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The complexities involved in applications for citizenship are not such that they could not be dealt with much more efficiently. We receive no more than 3,000 applications per annum, which amounts to an average of just 60 applications per week. The general principle is that the law provides that citizenship may be granted after five years' residence. The Bill does not provide that administrative neglect constitutes a ground for adding a further two years before consideration is given to an application. This practice should not be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I will listen with interest to the Minister set out his interpretation of the selection of guidelines that will apply to applications made under this section during the short time he has left in his current position.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">All of these matters must be viewed in their statutory context. Part III of the 1956 Act deals with naturalisation. Section 14 of that Act states that Irish citizenship may be conferred on a non-national by means of a certificate of naturalisation granted by the Minister. Section 15 sets out the normal conditions attached to granting naturalisation. It states that upon receipt of an application for a certificate of naturalisation, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant the application, if satisfied that the applicant meets a number of criteria, which are then listed. I distinguish between my whims, of which, I confess, there are many, and my absolute discretion, which is always exercised in a ministerial manner.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_712">I distinguish between whim and discretion. Nearly every country of our kind vests a discretion in the executive on these matters and does not grant people who are not citizens legal rights against the express wishes of the Government of the day of the naturalising country.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">As I stated, the criteria for the issuance of a certificate are set out in section 15. They include, for instance, that one must be of full age or, if a minor, have been born in the State. In addition, one must be of good character and have spent a period of one year's residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, had a total residence in the State of four years. Effectively this condition amounts to the five year rule. A further condition is that one must intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation. Deputies would be surprised by the number of applications for naturalisation I receive which were written in England by persons who make clear in their application that they have no intention of residing here. A further condition is that the applicant has made, "either before a Justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State." This final condition derives directly from the terms of the Constitution, which states that fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental duties of a citizen. These criteria are termed the conditions for naturalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Section 15A, which was inserted in the Act, deals with naturalisation of spouses of Irish citizens and lays downs a set of criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Section 16 is a power to dispense with conditions of naturalisation in certain cases. It provides that the Minister, at his discretion, may grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation in a specified set of cases when a condition or conditions for naturalisation are not complied with. The first such case is "where the applicant is of Irish descent..." People of Irish descent are, as a matter of law, already entitled to have the conditions set out in section 15 relaxed in their case. That has been the law since 1956.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">An application may also be granted where the applicant is of "Irish associations". The question arose as to what was the meaning of this term. It was always open to a person of Irish descent to apply for citizenship, even though he or she did not comply with the conditions set out in section 15. In 1956 this right related to descent was extended to cover "Irish associations". Under the passports for sale scheme, citizenship was effectively granted to people who had no connection with this country, except that they were making an investment in an Irish company. Section 16 sets out a number of other cases in which the Minister may waive some or all of the conditions of naturalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">In response to Senator Quinn's Private Members' Bill in the Seanad which sought by statute to bring an end to the passports for investment scheme, I undertook to narrow the meaning of "Irish associations" to exclude people who had no connection with the Irish State from being granted citizenship on the basis of simple investment. It is proposed to clarify that in section 10(2), which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_718">For the purposes of this section a person is of Irish associations if:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_719">(a) he or she is related by blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_720">(b) he or she was related by blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is deceased and who, at the time of his or her death, was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The question has been asked, what is the distinction between blood and affinity. My good friend and former colleague at the practising bar, Mr. Henry Murdoch, has a legal dictionary which I recommend to anyone who can take a recommendation. He defines affinity as relationship by marriage, the relationship between a husband and his wife's blood relations and between a wife and her husband's blood relations. He goes on to state that there is no affinity between a person and the relations by marriage of his or her spouse. That is what affinity means.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Let us remember that "descent" means being descended from an Irish citizen, or rather an Irish person, a person who was born in Ireland or was Irish at some stage in their life. "Affinity" means relationship by marriage and is a broader concept than a blood relationship. There is adoption where people can be related who have no blood or affinity type relationship, but are deemed by process of law to be the child of another. They are, therefore, entitled to citizenship by virtue of adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Section 12 of the 1956 Act allows the President, acting on the advice of the Executive, to grant Irish citizenship as a token of honour to a person, or to the child or grandchild of a person, who, in the opinion of the Government, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation. It is worthwhile remembering that those people are not honorary citizens in the sense that one is an honorary member of a golf club or an honorary bencher of King's Inns, which is not the real thing. These people are citizens in the real sense, but it is given to them as a token of honour. This is done on the basis that our Constitution does not permit titles of honour or nobility to be conferred on any person by the State, but we can confer citizenship as an honour on a person if that person has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation. Citizenship could be granted for service to the Irish nation outside Ireland. For example, if one worked among Irish emigrants in Australia or if one enfranchised or emancipated Irish people in some country abroad, that would entitle the State to grant citizenship to such a person.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">We had an interesting Committee Stage discussion on this and I referred to a few people who were granted honorary citizenship. Sir Alfred Chester Beatty, of the Chester Beatty Library, was granted citizenship in 1957 under section 12 of the Act. Mr. Tip O'Neill, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, was granted citizenship in 1986, as was his wife. Dr. Tiede Herrema and his wife were granted citizenship in 1975. Sir Alfred and Lady Clementine Beit were granted citizenship under this section in 1993. Jack Charlton and his wife were granted citizenship in 1996. Jean Kennedy Smith was granted citizenship in 1998 and Mr. Derek Hill, the celebrated artist, was granted citizenship in 1999. There is, therefore, a provision in Irish law for honouring people who do acts which are of huge service to the Irish nation. Benefactors to the Irish people at home and abroad have been honoured in this way. They are not merely people who have donated money or assets for the public use. Dr. Herrema was granted citizenship in very different circumstances, as recognition for the wrong that was done to him and for his courage and his positive attitude to Ireland notwithstanding the terrible wrong that was done to him in the 1970s. Jack Charlton and his spouse were granted citizenship, not for money spent in Ireland, but for their commitment to the sporting success of this country. Jean Kennedy Smith was granted citizenship because of her service to the cause of peace in Ireland and to the Irish American interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">It is not the case that there is nothing that can be done in the Bill under the Irish associations, as it is proposed to amend it, for people who do such things. On the contrary, there is clear evidence from the actual use of section 12 that the State is in a position to recognise people who have done great things for Ireland and for the Irish, wherever they may be, by granting citizenship to them as a token of honour.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">I am happy with the proposal that it should be by blood affinity or adoption because one can be a blood relative without being descended from an Irish person. If one's brother becomes an Irish citizen by naturalisation, one is therefore entitled to be considered of Irish association. If one is the spouse of someone who was granted Irish citizenship, or descended from a spouse or whatever, that is not a blood relationship but it is affinity. I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that the definition is broad, but by the same token, it is specific. Irish association means that one has some tangible connection, either as a matter of history or as a matter of fact, with someone who is an Irish citizen, or would be an Irish citizen if he or she was alive. The terms of the new subsection (2) intend to be a broad net. Deputy Costello wants to make it more specific. I thought there was consensus on Committee Stage that we wanted some latitude but that we also wanted some definition. I do not believe that the ministerial discretion referred to is particularly broad. It is not as broad as the presidential recognition provided for under section 12 of the 1956 Act. It is narrowed to people who have some connection with the State. It excludes granting of citizenship for bare investment in Ireland. That is not to say that somebody who comes here to establish a second Guinness brewery might not be of Irish descent. Such a person might merit the waiver of some of the conditions of section 15 of the 1956 Act on that account. We do not suggest that that is the case. The bare investment in Ireland should not confer on anyone the right to be a citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I have met the points made by Senator Quinn during the Seanad debate fairly and squarely. I have broadened this section as far as I should, whereas Deputy Costello's amendments would narrow it too much. When taken with section 12 of the 1956 Act, the Bill is reasonable in its present form. It is not likely to be the subject of abuse or to bring the granting of citizenship into disrepute, as it has been contended that it has been in the past. I do not propose to accept Deputy Costello's three amendments for those reasons.</p>

          <p eId="para_730">I agree with the Deputy that the delays in question are unfortunate. There were 1,293 applications for naturalisation in 2000, which is not long ago, but there have been 3,800 such applications so far this year. The substantial growth in the number of applications would not cause a significant problem in itself if it were not for the need to process 44,000 asylum applications during the same period. My predecessor and I had to use the human resources available to us to expedite citizenship and naturalisation applications, or to deal with asylum applications. It was necessary to deal with the asylum issue, for obvious reasons. We are now in a better position because the number of asylum applications is much lower and is likely to decline more rapidly in the near future. The House is well acquainted with the reasons for the decline in applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I assure Deputy Jim O'Keeffe that the system will change as a number of things happen in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I hope to bring forward interesting proposals in the near future about the organisation of the naturalisation and immigration service as a single executive office, in effect. Next year, I will introduce a general immigration and residence Bill, which has been awaited by many Deputies for a long time. All these measures will happen on my watch. Deputy O'Keeffe seems to be worried that they will require an intolerably long period of time to be implemented, but they should all happen in 2005.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">I am confident that a different picture will emerge as a result. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not choose to have 44,000 asylum applications descend on it at a time when the number of citizenship applications was doubling or trebling. These things happened in conjunction, but not on a planned basis. Approximately 600 public servants are dealing with these phenomena in one way or another. That is a huge section within the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">I accept fully Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's contention that the periods of time provided for in the Act should be indicative of the outcomes, but I have to accept that they are preconditions when applying for citizenship. One has to apply and the application has to be considered after that. Although it is not done in a restrictive way, it is far from an automatic process. It takes time to establish good character and to assess length of residence in the State. These things cannot be done in ten seconds on a "tick the box" basis, as if one were filling out an application for a driving licence. As it is a matter of discretion, the Minister has to consider, when the files arrive on his or her desk, whether the relevant factors that should be considered when making a discretionary decision have been taken into account. Those who think it can be an automatic operation, like an ATM, are wrong. There is an eight-month delay in the United Kingdom, which has a much larger office to deal with such matters and much more experience of significant volumes of applications for naturalisation. I agree that the delay is three times longer when one has to wait 24 months than it is when one has to wait eight months.</p>

          <p eId="para_739">My amendments do not relate to the cases of those who have applied for citizenship having already resided in this country for the specified five-year period. The Minister has given figures relating to the number of asylum seekers and has outlined that 600 officials in the Department are working on the issue. During the previous Report Stage debate on this Bill, I gave figures for the outstanding cases since the system changed in February 2003. The applications of the parents of just 465 Irish-born citizens have been processed since that date. Some 37 people have been deported following the consideration of such cases and all but 45 of the applications have been refused. As 78 officials are dealing with the cases, approximately six cases per official have been processed over 20 months. If the workload involved in each case is not extraordinarily difficult, it seems that some officials are taking their time to process cases. I did not receive a reply to my comments during the previous debate. Is it true that since the scheme ended in February, following the verdict in the L and O case in January, just 465 applications made by the parents of Irish-born citizens have been processed? Is it true that 78 officials are working on such cases?</p>
          <p eId="para_740">I will speak about my amendments. There is a thin line between one's absolute discretion and one's whim. If I have the absolute discretion to do what I like, I can do what I like without anybody else interfering or giving advice — nothing impinges on my decision. That sounds like a dictionary definition of one's whim. I am not trying to make the categories of people who are entitled to naturalisation and citizenship more specific or narrow, but to widen them and to provide certain criteria. It seems to me that the Minister's actions have narrowed the interpretation of the criteria which can be used for dispensing with the normal conditions for naturalisation. His definition of "affinity" is quite narrow because it relates to marriage alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">That is not a dictionary definition of "affinity" by any means and I do not know if it is a legal definition of the word. Perhaps the Minister will point out where in the legislation it is defined as such. Why would it not encompass partners? Surely that is affinity.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_744">I wish to touch on four issues in the brief time available to me. The first relates to definitions. The Minister said an Irish association can mean a person related by blood. I do not know if his explanation fully covers that point. What does that mean? How far back in generations can one go? There was substantial emigration from Ireland 200 years ago to an island in the Caribbean called Montserrat though such emigration was not voluntary. As I understand it, many of the population there have the surname Kelly or Murphy though on first sight they would not strike one as being of Irish descent. Would they be considered descendants of those people forced to leave Ireland? What would be their position if they wished to apply for citizenship? How far back can a relationship go in order to qualify under this provision?</p>
          <p eId="para_745">My second point also relates to affinity. There is much discussion these days about what constitutes affinity in the context of civil partnerships. The Minister in a recent statement to his party colleagues appears to have taken on board the definition of civil partnership as contained in Fine Gael documents. Do people in a same sex relationship constitute an affinity? That is a developing issue in this country and is one about which I am not certain of the answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The third issue relates to timing. I am not criticising the public servants trying to cope with the flood of applications from asylum seekers. I understand the Government was not ready for that flood and was in danger of being overwhelmed by it at one stage. The Minister mentioned there are 600 staff dealing with such applications which are decreasing considerably. Yet, the time limit for those awaiting a decision on their application for citizenship is increasing. When I inquired some six or eight months ago of the time limit for the processing of applications I was informed it was 15 months. The last communication I had on the matter indicated that such applications would be looked at within two years but that there is no guarantee they would be finalised within that period. Dealing with inquiries as to a person's good character and so on is not rocket science. I have no doubt that a standard letter could be sent to the Garda Síochána seeking reports on a person on the day his or her application is lodged. This is a management issue and the Minister is supposed to be the manager. This issue is causing a great deal of hardship for people and with proper management it could be very much improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The fourth issue relates to the provision of a helpline. People wishing to make inquiries of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are unable to get a response. One cannot get a reply to a letter or get through to personnel on the telephone. That is not the way to do business. I suggested some time ago — though I was not wishing to afford special priority to Members of the Oireachtas who represent many people — that an Oireachtas helpline be set up from which Members could ascertain the current state of affairs in relation to particular inquiries. Surely with modern technology it is not beyond the bounds of modern management to provide such a helpline. Once in place, such a helpline could be accessed by members of the public. Currently nobody, including Members of the Oireachtas, can make contact with the Department regarding the position of a particular application. That is no way to run a shop. I suggest to the Minister, from the point of view of providing a better service to the general public, that those issues should be addressed now.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">Wolfe Tone, Charles Stewart Parnell, Henry Grattan, Patrick Sarsfield and others would be people whose descendants by blood would be comprehended by this statute. The reference to Charles Stewart Parnell makes me think of the phrase "No man shall attempt to fix a boundary to the concept of Irish descent." We should not attempt to put the <i>ne plus ultra</i> in terms of the longevity of a line of descent and we never shall.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The figures used by Deputy Costello are misplaced. It is not true to say that 78 staff in the immigration division have been engaged in the activity in question since February 2003. That is the number of people involved as of October 2004. Formal notice of proposals to deport have been issued in the cases of 3,239 parents to date. In many cases, those notices generated comprehensive representations as to why, on humanitarian grounds, the person should not be deported and in each case staff were required to study carefully the circumstances of the case by reference to the L&amp;O case and the 11 different statutory grounds set out in the Immigration Act 1999. As a result of those considerations, I signed 345 deportation orders and decided that 45 persons should be granted leave to remain. A further 206 cases were found to involve parents who became citizens of the European Union on 1 May 2004 and no further action was required in that regard. Approximately 2,000 cases processed to the point of decision to deport or grant leave to remain can now be made, a decision which falls to be, and will be, made by me following enactment of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">As I pointed out during the course of the debate, such decisions are not easy and cannot be made on a broad brush basis. They comprise a wide variety of sets of circumstances. There are cases where relatively recent arrivals have two Irish born children and others where three of four children of the family in question have been looked after by relatives in their country of origin for a number of years. There are other cases where the families have told blatant lies, adding to the complexity and expense of dealing with their cases. Also, there are more than 100 cases before the High Court in the context of the judicial review proceedings and they require an enhanced level of consideration and tracking in terms of responding to the exigencies of litigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I do not accept the proposition that there has been under-performance in this area. It is a complex area. In the context of the passage of this legislation, I will adopt a pragmatic, generous and decent approach to those people currently in a form of limbo.</p>

If that is the total figure under this category, those who have made a contribution and been closely associated with Ireland, it seems the Minister is narrowing the interpretation.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_768">11.—Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a Report before the Houses of the Oireachtas detailing the propriety in the operation of passports for sale schemes in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">By common consent, the passports for sale arrangement is being closed off and will be buried by this Bill. There are no dissenting voices. However, it will be done, as I said on Second Stage, without a proper inquest into the scheme. We do not know the details of what happened under it. That is not the proper way to finish such a scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The papers relating to the scheme were sent to the Moriarty tribunal seven years ago. However, I have no idea what has happened since or what will happen. In the absence of clarity on the issue from the tribunal, I want to ensure a full report on the operation of the scheme will be made available. My concerns would be put at rest if the tribunal investigated the operation of the scheme and produced a report thereon. However, I am not positive about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Why is such a report necessary? It is necessary because the operation of the scheme, particularly in its early days, left much to be desired in propriety and legality. We should not be a party to burying this merely by closing off the scheme and forgetting about it. That is not the proper way to do business in a democratic state.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The scheme was proposed in good faith in 1986 by my Fine Gael Party colleague, Deputy John Bruton, to encourage foreign direct investment when there was little such investment. It was a system used in other countries at the time. While the idea was floated by Deputy Bruton, it was not adopted by the then Government. I was a Minister of State at the time. However, it was introduced in 1988 by the subsequent Government. Problems arose because it was not placed on a statutory basis but introduced by the back door through the Irish association reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Even by the broad provisions laid down by the then Cabinet, it is obvious the guidelines were not followed; the paperwork was usually defective and those responsible for the scheme at political level did not operate it in a way that could stand up to scrutiny. This occurred under the watch of the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Raphael Burke, and his successor Mr. Pádraig Flynn. However, the scheme was largely under the stewardship of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I am not pointing the finger at anybody. Let the tribunals do this, if they so decide. I simply want a proper historical record about what happened with the scheme and whether there was compliance with the law. What are the consequences in the instances where it was not? If there was a minor defect in the paperwork in the naturalisation of an individual, we cannot glibly say we must revoke his or her passport. I am only too aware of the consequences of so doing. I am also aware that in some cases a considerable investment was made in the State. Those who did so, did it as part of a <i>quid pro quo</i> bargain with the State. I am not looking for glib solutions, just the facts of the case. Only then can we decide what is proper and appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I am not raising issues about legitimate judgments made, claiming they can now be considered mistakes in hindsight. I am concerned that up to the establishment of proper administrative procedures, which I date to Ms Geoghegan-Quinn's tenure as Minister for Justice, there was a free booter approach to the issue of passports. Proper procedures were not in place; guidelines, if any, were not followed and, in some cases, the law was not followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">In hindsight, there are issues to raise about Máire Geoghegan-Quinn's term of office and the watches of subsequent Ministers. If knowledge which has become available subsequently had been available then, other decisions might have been made. However, that is not my concern. One is not entitled to use 20:20 vision in hindsight to question people's past decisions. My concern is that inappropriate processes were followed, especially in the early days of the operation of the scheme. We should not bury the scheme through legislation without ordering a full and clear report on it. If we do, there is a danger that we in this Parliament will be accused of a performing a whitewash, ignoring the facts and failing to do our duty as legislators.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I have tried to get to the bottom of this carry on by way of parliamentary questions. During the term of office of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, his reaction to Dáil questions was akin to the approach of General "Stonewall" Jackson during the American Civil War. He was not interested and did not want to involve himself in an open examination of the issues or a process of accountability and transparency. This is my last opportunity as a parliamentarian to raise the matter in the House and to highlight the need to compile a proper report on the operation of the passports for sale scheme before we consign it to history. For this reason, I have moved my amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_778">I agree fully with the wording of the amendment proposed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. It is important to deal finally with the propriety of the operation of the passports for sale scheme in the State. It is a matter of substantial public concern and matters of public concern have, over the years, become the subjects of tribunals. As the Minister has said, the files in this case have been passed to the Moriarty tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Reports on the issue were compiled by Máire Geogheghan-Quinn when she was Minister and by the current Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The case files have been sent to the Moriarty tribunal, over which hangs a question mark as to its future conduct of all the modules which may come before it. While the Minister cannot approach the Moriarty tribunal and tell it what to do, there is nothing to stop him compiling a report and presenting it to the House to show us what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">There is a question mark over events. There has been a certain amount of scandal. There is a question as to why a previous Minister retained unprecedentedly the communications portfolio on becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Why can we not have all the information on those who received passports under the investment-based naturalisation process, including the approval criteria, full biographical details at the time of application and where they are now? My later amendment proposes powers of revocation where a person has failed to adhere to the requirements of fidelity, loyalty and propriety in the process on which they were allowed to embark to become Irish citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">These are serious matters of public concern and there is a danger that if they are not dealt with by the Moriarty tribunal, there will be no further examination of them. I envisage no other opportunity or avenue to return to them if the Moriarty tribunal is not in a position to deal with them owing to the current strictures on its operation. Once legal fees are limited, one can bet one's life that the schedule of the tribunal will not be as expansive and questioning not as intense. The House has already passed a motion to limit the schedule of the tribunal. It would be most appropriate to deal with these matters now and for the Minister to arrange to provide a report to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_782">The effect of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment would be to oblige me to order a report on the manner in which the investment-based naturalisation scheme was operated and to lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas. I would be required to make the report available within three months. On a drafting point, the Deputy asks me in his amendment to detail "the propriety in the operation of the passports-for-sale scheme". I think he wants me to deal with the improprieties rather than the proprieties.</p>

          <p eId="para_784">If I were to produce a report to the House within three months as requested, I have no doubt that it would contain the following. It would detail my long-held opposition to the principle which informed the scheme and my serious misgivings as to its legal propriety, even if the highest standards of procedural nicety were observed in every case. The report would document that, with the exception of my immediate predecessor, every Minister to hold my office since 1989 gave a wide latitude to the term "Irish associations" which enabled applications to be made under the scheme. The departmental files for a significant number of cases in the 1988 to 1994 period fail to evidence compliance with all the rules of the scheme as set out in what was then known as the statement of intent. I am able to speculate on the conclusions I would draw because they represent a synthesis of what I have said in this or the other House since my appointment or are contained in the 38-page report of the review group on investment-based naturalisation. I published the report and placed it in the Oireachtas Library shortly after assuming office.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Lest it be said that I have not been clear about this issue, the House should note the following. I was asked by the Taoiseach in the context of a controversy which arose in 2002 to examine the appropriateness of a naturalisation decision by Raphael Burke. The particular file on the decision is with the Moriarty tribunal. The tribunal sought all the passports for investment files in respect of persons naturalised under the scheme prior to 1997. Copies of the files were left in my Department, but I compared them with the originals to ensure they were complete. I found that they were. My examination, about which I informed the House, confirmed that 11 passports and naturalisations were granted in a manner which was, even by the lax standards which had frequently characterised the operation of the scheme in question, irregular and unusual, to use the words with which I spoke to the House in October 2002. I informed the House that, in short, the passports and naturalisations in question appeared to be effected in a manner which bypassed usual formalities and ignored failures by applicants to comply with elementary documentary requirements. It appears the passports in question were prepared in advance of the completion of the applications for naturalisation and it has been reported that they were handed over to the applicants by the then Taoiseach at a lunch hosted by them in a Dublin hotel.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">As I pointed out to the House in October 2002 and before that, no departmental file is likely to carry any explicit evidence of gross impropriety or corruption on the part of any member of Government. Nonetheless, in the light of what we now know from the proceedings and reports of intervening tribunals, it would be fair to say that serious questions concerning the role of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, would be raised in the minds of anybody examining the file with the benefit of hindsight. I am not in a position to supply any explanation from the contents of the file, which I have examined, for his apparent interest in having the case processed with such unusual haste. These may be matters on which the Moriarty tribunal may be able to cast useful light.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">The file showed that the former Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, as Minister for Justice, in the context of ongoing controversy about the scheme and in the context of parliamentary questions about the 11 passports in question, was sufficiently concerned by the contents to commission a report by a senior departmental official. She subsequently drew her concerns about the scheme to the attention of the then Tánaiste and now Taoiseach in November 1994 and, at his request, furnished him with a memorandum summarising the basis for those concerns. Both she and the then Taoiseach resigned their respective offices shortly thereafter and the rainbow coalition Government took office, although this had nothing to do with the particular case. The inquiry ordered by Minister Geoghegan-Quinn proceeded under her successor, Nora Owen. An interim report was completed during Minister Owen's term of office and a copy of that interim report subsequently came into the possession of <i>The Irish Times</i> in September 1997, and was published in large measure by <i>The Irish Times</i> after Minister Owen had left office.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">That file has been in the public domain from 1997 to now. The report I put before the House is before the House. The only questioning remaining is whether I could do in a three month period, without any statutory powers, what Mr. Justice Moriarty has been asked by this House to do with full statutory powers of investigation. I could not, within three months, attempt to unearth anything useful other than what I have already said to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">I have absolute confidence in the Moriarty tribunal to visit this issue and to carefully examine it because it has the powers to do so and the legal terms of reference authorising it to do so. I have no doubt that it will do its job. Like Deputy O'Keeffe, I would like to know the full circumstances of the transaction in question involving the 11 passports. Simple curiosity and, I suppose, political partisanship on the part of any Member of this House would force us to seek the disclosure of the full facts but there is only one method I know of by which that can be done, and that is by a tribunal of inquiry which is given all the statutory powers to achieve that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">There is no question of me whitewashing this issue. I have given every co-operation to the Moriarty tribunal to enable it get to the bottom of this matter. It may well be that it faces difficulties. I do not know, but it would be wrong of me to contact that tribunal and ask it to discharge its function in a particular way or to expedite its inquiry into that particular matter simply because I am closing off this loophole now.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I do not believe that the ending of the passports for investment scheme brings down the curtain in some irreversible way on this issue. If, at some stage in the future, there is any basis for believing that a different inquiry from the Moriarty tribunal would yield better results, that is a matter for this House to address at that later point. I have been as concise and clear as any Minister or Member of this House could be on the basis of the material that was furnished to me. I have had access to the same material Minister Owen, Minister Geoghegan-Quinn, the departmental official who provided the report, the Moriarty tribunal and the inter-departmental committee which prepared the report I put before this House had access to. I do not have any more brilliant insight or more extensive powers than all of those institutions to come to conclusions which would be an advance on those we already have and which will be drawn, if appropriate, by the Moriarty tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">In those circumstances, I cannot accept this amendment, tempting though it would be to accept a three month mandate to second-guess the Moriarty tribunal in this way. There are other functions I have to do for the next three months, as the Deputies opposite will be keen to remind me if I take three months off to conduct this inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I would add that the Moriarty tribunal reverted to me during the summer for further assistance by my Department, which was given in full. I am doing everything I can and, in the circumstances——</p>

I apprehend from Deputy O'Keeffe's attitude that he believes this issue is being allowed to slip into the slumber of history. It is not. It is being fully investigated by a tribunal with full powers of investigation and terms of reference which authorise that investigation. I cannot prejudge the outcome of that investigation but I can say that whatever investigation is happening in the Moriarty tribunal is doubtless much more effective than anything that I, without any statutory powers, could attempt to do unaided.</p>

My concern is that, in many ways, we are asking the tribunals to wind up their business. That is the general message that is being sent to the tribunals and we are doing that in a situation where I have had no evidence that the Moriarty tribunal has focused on this aspect of its inquiry. That is my problem in respect of the Moriarty tribunal.

        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_805">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I wish to share time with Deputies Boyle, Eamon Ryan, Morgan, Cowley, Finian McGrath and James Breen. I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this modest legislation. It addresses an issue, which, if not resolved will have far reaching implications for the tourism sector. The intention of the legislation is plain and simple. We want to ensure the listing of public rights of way becomes a mandatory function in the drafting of development plans. Under current legislation, the preservation of existing public rights of way is deemed optional and it is not taken up that frequently by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The background to the legislation, however, is much more complex. By introducing legislation that obliges local authorities to list rights of way, we are attempting to prevent the continued erosion of both urban and rural rights of way throughout the Twenty-six Counties. They have gradually diminished for different reasons. While protecting them, we would like to go further to ensure access via rights of way to commonage and rough grazing ground but not without an inclusive deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">My colleague, Deputy Boyle, will outline the position in urban areas later while my party's environment spokesperson, Deputy Cuffe, will deal with the overall legal framework under the planning Acts, as will Deputy Gormley. These issues, however, are only part of the story. The broader story relates to how walking and hiking, a vital element of our tourism sector, is being allowed to die because no one is prepared to make tough decisions. Rural and agricultural communities are being denied incomes because of bad leadership and a lack of balance at both local and national level. My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has years of experience in the tourism industry, will discuss these and other matters from a business perspective shortly while my party leader, Deputy Sargent, will examine the issue and opportunities for farmers tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Walking is an important but declining part of our tourism industry. According to Fáilte Ireland, approximately 320,000 overseas walkers visited Ireland in 1993 but by 2002 100,000 had been lost and it is possible they will never return. Last year, 50,000 fewer walkers visited Ireland, which represents a 23% decline in 12 months. Given that the remaining sectors of the tourism industry are holding up following 11 September, why is Ireland haemorrhaging walking tourists? The anecdotal and factual evidence is that when it comes to walkers Ireland has changed from céad míle fáilte to céad míle "f. off".</p>
          <p eId="para_810">While only a minority of angry, frustrated and sometimes downright ignorant landowners are giving Ireland a bad name, there is enough of them to do our tourism industry untold damage. Abusing law abiding and polite visitors is an insult to our nation and it is also hits rural communities where it hurts most, in their pockets. There is no excuse for the antics of a minority of landowners, whatever their frustrations. Equally, there should be no place for the cold, stony refusal to allow walkers to roam on lands on which their forefathers roamed for generations. That stony silence is, however, more understandable.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Every day more restrictions are placed on walkers throughout the country through the erection of fences around old commonage, tracks and roads and a plethora of unfriendly and unwelcoming "Keep Out" signs. This is wrong, damaging and dangerous. UK and continental organisers of walking holidays are withdrawing from Ireland because of these access difficulties, which are not experienced elsewhere in Europe. The figures reflect the word of mouth message spreading across Europe that Ireland is not a good place for a walking holiday, unlike Scotland or Wales.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Are we shooting ourselves in the foot? What needs to be done? The Green Party has acknowledged that a solution to the current impasse involves the full input of the farming community, which should also include a financial recognition of the role playing by farmers. I pay tribute to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for his role in setting up Comhairle na Tuaithe, which has attempted to create dialogue between walkers, mountaineering groups and farmer representative bodies. Such dialogue has not been easy on both sides and while it is a welcome and positive development, it has not yet been a resounding success. The reason for this lies in the refusal of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce a system similar to that which pertained under REPS 1. This would recognise the role played by farmers and provide financial remuneration.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Farming groups insist that walkers should seek permission to cross private land and they will continue with such insistence, some nicely and some rudely. However, if a deal could be struck, it would be a win win situation. Farmers maintain the countryside in a state that walkers enjoy and it would not be in a fit state to walk across if farmers did not do so. However, they do not generate revenue similar to people in other sectors of the tourism industry for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">As my colleagues, Councillor Mary White and Deputy Sargent, have pointed out, farming may be changing but farmers are being presented with new opportunities. A healthy walking tourism sector could provide additional income opportunities for farmers such as the development and maintenance of walking routes, working as tour guides, providing transport or even offering walkers lunch. However, financial recognition of the valuable role of farmers in this area is needed. This would allow them to contribute to the rural economy so that everybody would benefit from tourism as equal stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The Green Party, contrary to a number of scurrilous remarks by Government Deputies, is a true friend of farmers and rural communities. I have pushed in previous contributions for the recognition financially of their substantial contribution to tourism. However, we are precluded from introducing provisions with budgetary implications in this legislation. In the interest of common sense and, hopefully, with a shared concern for the future of both our tourism and agriculture sectors, I ask the Government and Opposition Members to support the legislation, which is a small but important first step. I also urge the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Cabinet to examine our recommendations regarding the essential financial package needed to bring farmers on board. Then everyone can be brought together for a proper nuts and bolts debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_816">I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House. During previous debates on environmental issues, his predecessor did not appear. I also acknowledge Deputy Quinn's presence, as he has shown an interest in this issue. The legislation presents us with an opportunity to broaden the debate. Deputy James Breen and other Deputies representing rural constituencies have assisted us in raising this issue, which is important to many people domestically and internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Prior to my election to the House, I was involved in the tourism industry, particularly the walking sector. I served as chairman of Walking Cycling Ireland, a group which represented walking and cycling operators. I will make a few points based on my experience to enlighten the debate. There is a perception that organisers of walking holidays make significant money and are extremely successful but my experience is that the organisers have small businesses usually run from their homes but they have a knowledge of their communities bar none. Michael Gibbons in Connemara, whom Deputy Quinn knows, is an example. These people love their own areas and love showing it to visitors. This type of tourism should be encouraged. A Fáilte Ireland survey highlighted that most money was spent not by golfers, sailors or tourists on coach tours but by walkers and cyclists. They tended to stay in the country longest and spent more. These are the tourists we should attract.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Between 12 and 15 companies operated in this sector of the industry a few years ago and they were successful. Ireland was one of the leading countries in this sector and it was looked on similar to Tuscany, Umbria, the Loire valley as a great place to walk. Our country has a fantastic mixture of scenery and it has a perfect climate for walking, which, with the new Gortex rain gear, is not too bad. It was a thriving successful industry run by people who were sensitive and local. They brought money directly to the landladies they knew in the community and the local pub. They kept the local bus company going by using it rather than someone from overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">What happened? Long before foot and mouth disease, uncertainty came into the business. Five or six years before foot and mouth disease, walkers began to get nervous. Their acute antennae to the sensitivities in their community picked up the message that they were not welcome. The uncertainty came from the Government's lack of action to support them. Although the Government recognised this was becoming an issue, over the past five years it failed to do anything. As a result of that uncertainty, the business people pulled back. They realised that if they did not have community support, they would not push it.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">When it came to the foot and mouth disease crisis, there was a remarkable response from those small business people to the Irish farming community. They showed a remarkable voluntary willingness to withdraw from business. I can think of various examples where people by their own initiative shut down for a lengthy period in support of farmers, even after the crisis had passed. I hoped that would create an atmosphere where the farming community would recognise the remarkable generosity and co-operative spirit shown by the industry and that we would have a new era where it would have been possible to make arrangements and agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">There was nothing specific. These people would not get into trouble because they were too closely connected to the community to allow matters develop to that stage. However, they were concerned that they could not even afford the risk of bringing visitors and being told they were not welcome. In that sense of uncertainty which existed and was created by the inaction of this Government, they withdrew from the business. The business has gone away to other countries and we have not seen it back since.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">This Bill is one step of many needed to bring certainty into the area. We need certainty as to rights and obligations of landowners and visitors. Earlier today we were talking about Bewley's. There is a famous statute in the city council that Deputy Quinn will know that landowners have obligations as well as rights. It is important to remember that and to recognise that this may not be convenient for every landowner with regard to some rights of way. However, they have an obligation, as part of society, to allow access to locals and visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">As a local Deputy I have been working for the past three years to try and create the idea of a Dublin upland park in the Dublin hills with better access to them and better routes across them. As well as the Wicklow way which heads north-south we could have an east-west route. We could also have a circular bus route connecting different points on the routes. We could get off in Tallaght, walk into the hills as far as Glencullen or further and get a bus back home. This would be a creative use of the best facility we have. One of the cornerstones we need to achieve this is acknowledgement of the rights of way that exist. Everyone knows they exist. I have spent the past 30 years of my life since I was a child climbing from Dundrum into the Dublin hills, up Ticknock, Kilmashogue etc. I have been using those routes for years. The rights of way exist, but they are starting to disappear.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The M50 has cut off the majority of these rights of way. It has cut off the sense of connection from our city into the hills. Others of them have been covered by overgrowth or have been lost because of private development or because of fences. If we do nothing and just stop and let them go, the next generation will not have the experience of the connection I have had with the Dublin and Wicklow hills. They will have nothing like the experience Beckett had in the previous century, which formed all his literature, the sense of getting up into the mountains. That sense of space is hugely important in a city. This Bill would push councillors to work on the sort of plan needed to provide rights of way and that is the reason I urge Government Deputies to support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_825">The obvious effect of the passage of this Bill will be to identify, hopefully for greater usage, rights of way and walkways in the countryside. Another effect is that the same provision with regard to listing rights of way will also apply to all urban authorities. I would like to mention briefly the advantages of such provision in the development plan of urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The provision would help in a number of ways. Ordinarily, rights of way are something that come about historically in a community. They are the quickest route from "A" to "B" that people have chosen and trodden for generations. Unfortunately, as a result of bad planning in many of our urban areas in the 1960s and 1970s we created laneways and passages, concrete mazes that need to be identified and properly listed. Actions must be planned and put in place with regard to their future value and use. We know that in many communities these artificial rights of way and walkways have become centres of anti-social behaviour and areas of threat for people who live in communities in their immediate area. The value of listing rights of way in a comprehensive fashion will help urban local authorities to properly identify and deal with this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Given the scope of urban renewal and development in inner city areas, many laneways are being lost. These laneways carry a heavy social history. To be honest, many of them were former slum areas and open sewers. However, they still represent the social history of the areas in questions and efforts should be made to list and acknowledge these routes. In my local authority area of Cork city, the old laneways of North Main Street, for example, are all acknowledged and named even though they have been closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Another important area with regard to rights of way in urban areas is the natural hinterland. Most towns and cities are built on waterways, rivers and canals. The access the public has to these areas is often restricted. Many local authorities make brave attempts to open as much of these sites as possible. However, as a result of the ownership of various bits of land that are not open to the public and the building of properties that affect direct access over prolonged periods of time, many of the areas are not as open as they should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">One of the advantages of the Government's and other parties support on this Bill and for the listing of rights of way would be the recognition of the natural routes that exist along waterways in cities. Ultimately, that would not only help add to the quality of life in urban communities, it would also have potential health benefits. I remember the four mile route I took every day to the third level college I attended in Cork. It was more on pathways than roadways because it passed through a number of secondary schools and hospital grounds. People choose the routes most beneficial to them and this is as true of cyclists as it is of walkers. In our urban areas we need to give formal recognition in our development plans as to how those routes can be best identified and utilised. The likelihood is that if we fail to put in place legislation of this type, we will not bring about the potential that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">That said, we should recognise the work that has been done by various local authorities despite constraints. The addition of the boardwalk on the river Liffey is an example of what can and should be achieved. I suspect the difficulties many urban authorities have is the lack of legal instruments that would help them do the type of developments they would like. It is a sad state of affairs that in both rural and urban communities, most of the promoted walkways come about through the urging of outside agencies, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery tonight, for example, Keep Ireland Open. The work of the Irish Heart Foundation should also be acknowledged as regards the putting in place of walks and routes for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">We want the Minister to speak positively about what can and should be done in this area. In presenting this Bill we acknowledge the limitations that exist on all Private Members' Bills, in terms of not being able to put forward any measure that would bring a cost upon the State. If the Bill is allowed proceed to Committee Stage — we hope it will — a number of amendments can be made and accepted both from the Government and other parties that will allow it to become a stronger Bill. We hope the Minister will take this positive attitude in his response.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_832">Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Green Party for sharing time. Sinn Féin has stated on many occasions that the land of Ireland belongs to the people and that it must be managed in a manner that prioritises the public good. This means finding a balance between the right of people to enjoy Ireland's mountains, woodlands, boglands and seashore and the needs of farmers who struggle to make a living from that same land. Sinn Féin wants to see access to the countryside improved and regulated in a manner which safeguards the livelihoods of small farmers, protects the environment and contributes to the improvement of economies in rural communities. We also want to see the State network of waymarked walking ways further developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">There have been a number of high profile cases in recent years which have highlighted the deficiencies in public policy and legislation in regard to access to the countryside and pathways which, though used by the public for generations, pass through private land. There has also been an increased level of tension between hill walkers and farmers who in many cases fear they will be held responsible for accidents which may occur to hill walkers while on their land.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The European Union has commented that there should be a presumption to allow access to the countryside unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. Ireland is among the most restrictive in the European Union in terms of such access. This is not helpful for a State whose primary selling point for tourists is its unspoilt and scenic countryside.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">There is evidence that the current situation is having a negative effect on rural tourism. The number of hikers and hill walkers fell from 322,000 in 1993 to 219,000 in 2002. Addressing this issue will benefit both rural communities and those who seek access to the countryside for recreational purposes. Tourism generated through promoting the use of the rural environment for recreational activities can be of significant benefit to rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I welcome the approach being taken to this issue by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív. The establishment of the rural-agri-tourism advisory group to consider the relevant issues and the commitment to consult interested groups before drawing up proposals is to be welcomed. A partnership approach to this issue is clearly the right way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The proposal to establish a countryside recreation council needs to be teased out further and examined to assess whether this would be sufficient to deal with the issues involved. While the proposal for such a council would address the majority of the problems between rural communities and hill walkers and hikers, I question whether it would be adequate to deal with cases where the issue is a genuine concern by a small farmer that he or she would be held liable for accidents on his or her farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">In addition, there has been an attempt by the wealthy to fortify and exclude the public from traditional walkways which, though there may be no legal right of way, have been used from time immemorial. Such paths are traditional rights of way with which most people are familiar, though they may not be aware that they have no legal standing.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The Old Head of Kinsale case is of interest in this regard. It is a scandal that local people who have walked on it from time immemorial can no longer do so. The land was bought from Cork County Council by developers who were given permission to develop an exclusive golf course on the condition that public access to the land would not be restricted. However, it became clear that the developers had no intention of allowing the public access to the land. In 2003 the Supreme Court issued a judgment to the effect that there would be no public access to the Old Head of Kinsale. It held that a condition imposed by An Bord Pleanála granting public access was outside the powers of the board and, therefore, void. It found there had been no lawful public access to the Old Head of Kinsale before the golf club was built and the purpose for which it was developed was unrelated to the question of public access to the Old Head of Kinsale. It concluded that the condition of public access imposed by the board was outside its powers. I envisage major problems in regard to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Another issue worth raising which is connected with this debate is the damage being caused to hills by off-road vehicles, quads and scrambler bikes. This is a recent phenomenon but one that is growing rapidly as off-road vehicles become ever more popular. Often those participating in this activity are unaware of the resulting destruction of the hillside. Although local authorities have powers to introduce by-laws to severely restrict such activities, it is unfortunate that only a small number have chosen to do so. There must be exemptions for farmers who of necessity require the use of such vehicles for hillside farming. The Department should require local authorities to introduce legislation restricting vehicles such as those to which I refer. The issues of access and erosion are of the utmost importance for the protection of our hillsides. Proper access must be allowed so as to preserve this outdoor activity for the many people involved in it, while at the same time encouraging the enormous untapped tourism potential of this sector. However, the needs of small farmers must also be protected. I welcome the Bill and hope it will go some way towards encouraging the Government to act quickly to resolve the matter.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_843">I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Land has been sacred in our history, particularly to those living in rural areas. I am aware of the deeply held views of people living in my area. John B. Keane has written about this issue. Everybody in my area realises the value of land because in the past people were taken off vast tracts of land by the occupier. As happened in my area, in some cases entire villages were relocated in order that a landlord could have a very nice garden. As a result, land is very dear to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">I welcome this debate which aims to balance the rights of landowners and others. There has been a certain amount of bullying on the part of those who push aside the property rights of small landowners, particularly in the west. It is obvious that such an approach does not work and I greatly welcome the attempt to reach a rational solution. What has happened runs very deep with rural dwellers. Insurance and public liability are major issues in terms of people coming onto private land. As I stated, property rights have not been respected. A balance needs to be struck because farmers must have their livelihoods protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Current development trends have resulted in an increase in the number of people drifting towards urban areas. We are increasingly becoming an urban society as the population in rural areas continues to drop, which in some cases is due to a planning approach which lacks rural proofing. I would welcome anything which would redress this imbalance and allow people to stay in rural areas. Too often people have been driven away. There was a sad migration of older people to institutions because there was insufficient accommodation for them in their own communities. This could be redressed by supporting sheltered and social housing which helps to keep people in their own areas rather than being driven into urban centres which are already totally congested. For example, yesterday there were traffic jams on the southern route into the capital which probably made history. This is because everything radiates from the capital. This needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Statistics show that the population of rural areas is constantly falling but with proper support people could stay in their own areas. I know the Minister is agreeable to a proposal intended to deal with returned emigrants, for example, those in County Mayo, who cannot even build on their own land. This is very regrettable. Special accommodation should be made available to people who have been away from this country for a long time, many of whom have nothing left except a small holding, two examples of which I have encountered. Some have great difficulty in staying in rural areas because they cannot find proper accommodation. There needs to be a greater bias towards rural dwellers.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_847">I welcome the opportunity of speaking to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2004, which progressive legislation has been presented by the Green Party. I commend Deputy Gogarty for bringing it before the House. As an Independent Deputy, I will always take a serious look at all new Bills and, if I like them and consider them worthwhile, I will support them. That is why I am supporting this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">When one considers the detail of the legislation, one can see that its intention is to ensure the listing of public rights of way becomes a mandatory function in the process of drawing up a development plan. In the current legislation, the Planning and Development Act 2000, the preservation of existing public rights of way is deemed optional. This Bill seems to be stronger and more progressive. In regard to rights of way in general, it is also appropriate to raise the issue of open spaces, violence, anti-social behaviour and the drug sales which take place in many lanes throughout this city and State.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I am sure many Deputies agree with the proposal to erect gates on laneways and block entrances in order to end gang warfare, anti-social activities and threats to the elderly. These lanes have become a nightmare for many communities. I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to wake up to this reality. It is unacceptable that families and the elderly are bullied and intimidated by anti-social elements hanging around lanes and open spaces. This is also a major policing issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">We need to see more gardaí working in and for the community. What is happening is a total disgrace. I wish the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would take his head out of the sand on these important crime-related issues. I raise this issue in this debate to try to highlight the pain and suffering in many communities, particularly disadvantaged ones. The people are sick and tired of the lack of action and need our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">There is a lack of respect for parks and open spaces. It is all very well to live in a wealthy society and a booming economy but we also have a sinister side which destroys local parks, communities and laneways. This reality must be confronted. It is a justice issue which requires the attention of a Minister adopting a hands-on approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">In the context of planning and development, a word of caution must be expressed in regard to wild-cat developments which are totally out of character with local areas. I am working with residents in my constituency in Clontarf, Killester and Artane to improve the quality of life for all residents and emphasise the need for proper planning in line with the local area. Building huge seven storey apartment blocks in areas of two storey houses is not quality planning. We need to stop the destruction of our cities. I raise these issues in this debate because of the need for common sense when it comes to planning and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I urge all Deputies to support this Bill and work closely with farmers, the tourism industry and walkers on the question of access to public areas. I commend and thank Deputy Gogarty and the Green Party for bringing the Bill before the House which I am happy to support.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_854">As a member of the farming community, I oppose this Bill. I do not agree that the public right of way to a recreational utility or otherwise should be made optional. Existing rights of way should be accessible to the public without the creation of new introductions which would place an enormous burden on the farming community. The public and visitors alike access the countryside for a variety of pursuits, including walking, cycling, hunting and fishing. In nearly all instances, there is access to the countryside and farm land without objection from farmers. However, farmers are faced with major concerns about certain issues surrounding recreational access to their properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">A key factor in the life of farmers is that farm land is a working environment with machinery, crops and livestock. If new public rights of way are introduced in the light of farmers' activities, it could prove detrimental both for the safety of the recreational user and the farmer. This cannot be done without some form of control and vigilance to watch out for people who may not be aware that such activities are a normal part of country life. Farmers are faced with litigation from recreational users or trespassers due to risks not of their making. It is also becoming increasingly likely that some property owners may not be able to afford the cost of liability and, should they suffer a successful case against them, stand to lose everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">Other issues also arise from damage to property and the pressure and number of recreational users entering farm land at particular popular locations. The development of the commercial use of private property by tour operators and the decrease in economic viability of upland farming have led to a search by farmers for alternative sources of income often at odds with easy access. All of these problems are very real for small rural communities and additional losses through a drop in farm incomes could prove disastrous for many. I support the appeals for access to the countryside by all but would welcome a more practical system, providing sensible solutions which would ensure such public rights of way do not adversely infringe upon the rights of farmers and land owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">In County Clare there are a number of historic monuments, including the Burren, a popular destination for tourists. Existing rights of way must be protected. In County Clare we have walkways which are a welcome development and general access to the countryside is easy. I oppose the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">I thank the Deputies who have contributed and the Green Party for introducing the Bill which I am opposing. I will outline the basis on which I am so doing. I am sympathetic to the idea that we must keep and develop our extraordinary asset of the countryside, as expressed by Deputy Eamon Ryan. However, there are serious problems with the legislation which I will outline.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The Government is fully conscious of the importance of ensuring access to the countryside and the importance of access to rural tourism and sustainable development. For this reason, the Government wishes to promote maximum access to the countryside consistent with the rights of land owners. We believe strongly a balance must be struck and that the measure promoted by the Green Party, while well-intentioned, is misguided in the extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The objective of the Bill may be positive but its effect would be bureaucratic and do little for the real objective of promoting greater access to the countryside. In fact, it could have unforeseen consequences. While it may be well intentioned, it is not workable. It would be prejudicial to the dialogue being facilitated by Comhairle na Tuaithe between all the parties involved in the issues associated with public access and public rights of way. The partnership approach will achieve more than <i>force majeure</i>; it will produce more workable, sensible and less bureaucratic responses.</p>

          <p eId="para_862">I did not interrupt the Members opposite, even though I was tempted to make references to Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Deputy should show the same forbearance.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Public rights of way are separate from development plans. They are frequently rooted in history, for example, the mass paths in Greystones arise from mores in another time. The Planning and Development Act 2000 allows planning authorities to include objectives in their development plans for the preservation of specified rights of way. In addition, a new procedure for the inclusion of rights of way in the development plan is set out in the 2000 Act. This procedure provides for the giving of notice by the planning authority to the owner and occupier of the land over which there is a right of way and the receipt of submissions from the owner or occupier which must be taken into consideration by the planning authority. The decision to include a right of way is made by the elected members and there is a right of appeal to the Circuit Court. There is, in fact, a democratic way of dealing with the issue. This is an example of the legal instruments in place. Deputy Boyle appeared to ignore them.</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_865">Once a public right of way has been included in a development plan through these procedures, it may be included in subsequent plans without further formalities. It is also important to note that the 2000 Act also permits planning authorities to create new rights of way where it is felt they are necessary. This point was also missed in the Members' contributions. The existing legislative position sets out a reasonable approach. It allows planning authorities, at their discretion, to gradually add to the rights of way listed in their development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The Bill is unworkable for a number of reasons. Partnership works but force will not in this area. The issue of public access is better dealt with through co-operation and consultation with landowners rather than through the mandatory approach outlined in the Bill which would be prejudicial to the dialogue being facilitated by Comhairle na Tuaithe between all the parties involved in this complex issue. Suggesting that complex issues such as this can be resolved by diktat may appeal to some Stalinist inclination but shows little understanding of human nature.</p>

          <p eId="para_869">It can be difficult to establish whether there is a right of way. There have been many difficult cases, arising in part from the type of urban change and development mentioned by Deputy Boyle. Any attempt at listing all public rights of way would lead to much discussion, acrimony and, possibly, controversy in the preparation and adoption of the development plan. It could lead to an extraordinarily protracted period of arid debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_871">Any omissions would be in limbo. If the Bill was passed, there would be many appeals by landowners against the inclusion of rights of way in the development plan. This would clog the courts, produce much sterile and wasteful arrangements and invariably prohibit sensible compromise. Any attempt to press a solution on all landowners, the good and welcoming as well as the small proportion mentioned by Deputy Gogarty, would damage the partnership approach. This is a complex issue which can best be resolved by a partnership approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">I am anxious to see resolution of these matters because I am more than a little familiar, as a Deputy representing County Wicklow, with the things that can occur. We have seen some extraordinary examples. One is in the Enniskerry area where rights of way and access points which had been walked on for years are now subject to court actions. As a result, the issue will be tied up forever. If the parties involved — the walkers are particularly willing to do so — would meet in a forum such as Comhairle na Tuaithe, the issue could be resolved without resorting to the wigs.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">The Deputy is correct. However, they now find themselves enmeshed in a legal mare's nest not of their making. If we tried to deal with this issue in a prescriptive way, imagine how many more times that would arise. Dialogue can and should resolve such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Another inevitable consequence if this proposal becomes law is that it would divert planning authorities' scarce resources away from priority operational tasks. Listing all rights of way would be no small task. A further point is that the proposed mandatory listing of all public rights of way would produce documents of such complexity as to render them and the development plans unintelligible. Under the Roads Act 1993 all roads are classified as public rights of way and, as such, would have to be listed in the development plan. If the Bill became law, there would be a bureaucratic nightmare which would not produce the results its sponsors seek but simply sterility.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The Bill would mean an amendment of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which, together with the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, was the product of a major review of the planning code and which revised, extended and consolidated the legislative basis for the planning system. Such a piecemeal approach to a complex area such as planning, while well intentioned, has nothing to commend it.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">The new planning arrangements need time to bed down. The Government wishes to promote access to the countryside for the benefit of rural tourism and sustainable development. In the few weeks I have been in office I have sought major proposals in these areas. We have landscape which is accessible and open to the people and which could have a tremendously positive benefit. The issue of public access to the countryside is better dealt with through co-operation and consultation with landowners. This partnership approach is at the heart of recent initiatives pursued by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Comhairle na Tuaithe — the Countryside Recreation Council — was established in January this year and is just finding its feet. Its purpose is to ensure all those with an interest and concern for the sustainable development and management of recreational amenities in the countryside are fully consulted on the future development of these amenities. The council is widely representative of countryside and outdoor interests, including the Irish Uplands Forum, Irish Ways, Coillte, Keep Ireland Open, Mountaineering Council of Ireland, Failte Ireland, the ICMSA, the IFA, the Irish Sports Council and Walking Cycling Ireland. This is an impressive partnership by any standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The positive outcomes from a partnership approach are illustrated by the national social partnership agreements achieved to date and which have played such a positive role in the State. It is important that all stakeholders buy in to the solutions in this area. Anybody trying to force solutions in rural Ireland is barking up the wrong tree.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I come from County Wicklow where there has been a degree of unwelcome pressure to close rights of way. Therefore, I sympathise with the Bill. However, there are practical arguments against it. It attempts to implement legal change when what is necessary is a change in mentality. That is the more appropriate solution. This will be achieved through the partnership approach. The Bill could put at stake all the progress made by Comhairle na Tuaithe if its constituent bodies feel under threat and remove themselves from the partnership process. It could bring us back to the well publicised confrontations which occurred in previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Deputy Cowley is correct that there is a need to proof legislation for its impact on rural life and rural lifestyles. I agree with Deputy Gogarty that the best people at preserving our countryside are often farmers. However, we will not secure any benefit if they feel their backs are being put to the wall. I was interested in Deputy Boyle's remarks on urban rights of way. He is correct that the discussion takes place all too frequently in a rural context.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">I was puzzled by Deputy Finian McGrath's contribution on the same issue. I am very familiar with the problems of thuggery in lanes and the difficulties in terms of closing them off. There has been an amazing debate on one such particular right of way in Greystones during the past year. People have argued with vigour and passion that they have a right to walk. Everyone agrees with that. However, those who live beside the problem area to which I refer argue that their lives have been made miserable. A pensioner has had to abandon her house, a family was obliged to move to the back of its house and property has been damaged. The issue of creating a mandatory requirement in this particular area could end up making difficulties for us. I am sure that is not the intention but it could be the effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The issue of public rights of way and access to the countryside is significant in rural policy terms. I am convinced that the partnership approach being adopted, together with the discretionary powers available to planning authorities is the best way to deal with this issue. In the context of the initiative established by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, we have set up a partnership arrangement which can solve some, if not all, of the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">I am interested in this area but, for the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_897">For a number of years, a minority of people have consistently stated that the way to solve this problem is to introduce increasingly inflexible legislation. I have stated on numerous occasions that this does not represent the way forward. The Government is always being accused of trying to create a nanny state by introducing too much restrictive legislation. On this occasion, however, it is not the Government but the Green Party which must stand accused of the same fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">In reply to a parliamentary question last month, I made it clear that I did not have any current proposals to introduce legislation in respect of access to the countryside. It is interesting that the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution also considered this issue in the context of Articles 40.3.2o and 43 of the Constitution, which relate to private property rights. Its report did not recommend any requirement for changes in the existing legislative framework in this regard. I reiterate that I do not see legislation as the solution to this problem. Legislation should only be considered when a consensus has been arrived at and not as a partisan way of solving problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I wish to make it clear that where public rights of way exist, they must be left in place. Nobody can remove a public right of way. However, if no public right of way exists, including it in a county plan will not make it, of itself, a right of way. The Bill proposes to include public rights of way in county plans. However, it would first be necessary to prove they were public rights of way.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The amendment to the Planning and Development Act 2000 proposed by the Green Party does nothing to resolve disputed rights of way. If enacted, the legislation would only create an impossible situation for local authorities. The Green Party is concerned about all public rights of way and that must be implicit in the legislation. That is where the practical difficulties arise. By making it mandatory to list all public rights of way, one would obviously register those rights of way where there is no disputing the county plan. The latter would cause no problem. However, an interesting question would then arise, namely, if there was a disputed right of way, would every local authority end up in the courts before their next county plans were finalised in order to establish whether a right of way exists?</p>

Let us imagine a scenario where a court did not give an immediate adjudication in a dispute. Endless disputes would arise, particularly if there was a necessity to list all instances where doubts might exist about the existence of a right of way. Would the planning authorities adhere to the timeframes laid down in legislation in respect of introducing their county plans or would they wait for the adjudication of the courts? Would they include them on the basis that they might be rights of way when the courts had concluded their deliberations or would they leave them out? If they left them out and it emerged that they were rights of way, would the local authorities be in breach of the law? The matter would become a total morass.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">The Government is already tackling the issue in respect of walkways and public rights of way. Following the publication of the report of the consultation group on access to waymarked ways, I established Comhairle na Tuaithe in February 2004. This group was established to ensure that everybody with an interest or concern in this area would be consulted. Membership of Comhairle na Tuaithe encompasses representatives of all the main farming organisations, landowners, tourism marketing bodies, the Irish Sports Council, the Heritage Council and those of recreational users of the countryside, such as Keep Ireland Open, Waymarked Ways and the Mountaineering Council of Ireland. The membership was based on the recommendations in the report of the consultation group on access to waymarked ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">The course of action taken is consistent with the recommendation of the all-party committee's report. The committee felt that such an approach would help encourage joint tourism projects, as well as avoiding the heavy mapping costs incurred during the legislative approach taken in England and Wales. I envisage trying to help bring about a solution through a community based approach will point the way forward. Given our general partnership approach to solving problems, this is, in my view, the correct way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">I am satisfied that Comhairle na Tuaithe is working well. When I addressed its national conference earlier this month, I pointed out that the community spirit is still very much to the forefront in Irish society. We need to try to see the bigger community picture in respect of this issue. By listening to each other and working together as a community to reach an amicable agreement which accommodates all sides, we can present a positive image of rural Ireland and, crucially, rural tourism. This can only serve to benefit all members of our rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I have also made it absolutely clear that there must never again be a situation where people using advertised and agreed walkways are accosted on them. The damage this type of behaviour does to our international tourism reputation is incalculable and is particularly damaging to rural areas. If those on both sides of the access debate are reasonable, generous and community-minded, this would serve the best interests of rural tourism in Ireland and more important, the best interests of rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The recent conference was a first step in the development of a countryside recreation strategy and I look forward to hearing from Comhairle na Tuaithe on its proposals in this regard next year. There is an agreement with the farmers that no waymarked way will be advertised next year without their agreement. The farmers have been equally accommodating by saying that, in that event, they will not accost people on waymarked ways. At least there is now some certainty. It is a situation of non-confrontation which will not create headlines in newspapers. We are not creating the kind of publicity that is manna from heaven to those in other countries who are our rivals in the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_913">They will be consulted through the farming organisations who are total participants in this process. I have first-hand experience in dealing with this situation and how progress can be made. Many farmers are very interested in developing walkways and are proactively involved, and creating a divide will not bring the situation forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">I have launched the rural social scheme which includes as one of the identified areas of work the maintenance and enhancement of waymarked ways and other agreed walking routes. I estimate this could provide work for 500 farmers. The advantage of this scheme is that people see the payback. Even if the person whose land is being used in the scheme does not work on the scheme, one of their neighbours will inevitably do so. I believe — it is certainly true in my part of the world — there is still enough community spirit for people to see that if something is good for their neighbour, it is good for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">I am also examining ways of using other programmes such as the CLÁR programme to develop walkways, turnstiles, parking areas etc. This will serve to improve the infrastructural amenities as agreed walkways help to develop the rural tourism product and provide increased opportunities for sustainable rural development and promote rural Ireland as an attractive and viable tourist destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">When the rural tourism award was presented yesterday, it was interesting to see that farmers had developed walkways on their own land and were developing marvellous tourist products. I do not believe a big rural-urban divide exists in this issue and there is no need for it. We must persuade people to see the common interest. This legislation would be seen as partisan, as taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Agreements already in existence can be cemented into the county plan on a voluntary basis. They can be picked off, one by one, until agreement is reached but no one is forced head on into the controversy with an initial plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">I ask Deputies to consider this very seriously and not run ahead of a process which by its nature is slow. Agreements have been achieved to date which mean there will be no public dispute, please God, next year. Walking places will be available by agreement. These might be limited in number but it is surely better to have a limited number of agreed walking places than to have a huge number which are disputed.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Mention was made of the REP scheme. During my time as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, I investigated this matter. I was informed that the European Union was not willing to have a REPS 3 similar to REPS 2, and that door was closed. Others on the Opposition side have suggested that rights to cross land should be paid for. That is dead money and I have said this to the farming organisations. A farmer might receive approximately €1,000 a year, but giving a farmer a job could be worth €20,000 a year. Would that bring tourists into the country? It would not and it would be dead money. It would be a better idea to invest the money and many farmers are now persuaded in this direction. Investment in facilities, in the development of walkways, car parks facilities, bed and breakfast accommodation, restaurants and so on would be preferable. Everybody in a rural community would benefit.</p>

          <from>Ms Fox</from>
          <p eId="para_923">I welcome the opportunity to comment on the subject of public rights of way and to outline some of my concerns with the proposed amendment to the Planning and Development Act. The issue of rights of way cannot be completely ignored simply because they are controversial. It certainly is desirable that every public right of way should be clarified, but this is idealistic and unfortunately the practicalities of that process will not be a quick or easy fix solution. I do not believe this amendment is the way to address the issue of rights of way, by simply making it a mandatory requirement on local authorities that all public rights of way should be listed in their development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Many people automatically think that public rights of way are a rural issue but that is not the case. As has been outlined in the debate they are a major problem in many urban areas, where public rights of way through housing estates have caused anti-social behaviour and often have had to be closed off by local authorities, which has caused division within communities. Often the local authority is forced to carry the can financially and has to remove dumped rubbish, provide lighting and install CCTV in extreme cases to prevent anti-social behaviour. In many cases the financial burden has implications for the Garda and the emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">This amendment focuses on the more amenity-oriented rights of way, but there is nothing in it to exclude the huge network of urban rights of way, and roads, which as a previous speaker noted are all public rights of way. I do not believe that the financial burden of listing and preserving these rights of way should fall on the limited budgets of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The mechanism of how a right of way is determined is not dealt with in this amendment. That issue should be determined before the law is changed. Who determines what is an existing right of way and what should be created as a right of way? Who is arbitrator where a dispute arises? The courts decide in the case of a dispute and this amendment will not change that. Local authorities should not be expected to foot large legal bills in the establishment of rights of way.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The Planning Act deals with the creation of new public rights of way under section 14. This section outlines the method in which the landowner is required to be notified of the council's intention to create rights of way across the property. There are various provisions for appealing this decision, including the right to go to court to decide the matter. Under this section any rights of way already listed in a development plan are not required to be readvertised nor the landowner notified.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">I refer to my local area and the Wicklow county development plan. A large number of what were termed "access routes to amenity areas", similar in description to those outlined in the Green Party amendment, were listed without the knowledge or consent of the landowners. These routes first appeared in the 1999 development plan as proposed access routes to amenity areas, yet somehow five years later, in 2004, the description changed from proposed access routes to existing access routes. This creates a lot of mistrust among landowners in particular. On the question of the practicalities of forcing a local authority to list and preserve rights of way as part of the development plan process, the making of a development plan is time-consuming and covers a wide range of issues. Often the few controversial issues, which no doubt will include rights of way, will dominate other areas of the plan requiring attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The Act as it is worded is balanced. It allows local authorities to list public rights of way, but does not put the onus on them to take on a role which is financially or administratively cumbersome. In most of these cases issues such as liability, maintenance and other matters will have to be thrashed out locally. The local authority should not have to take on the role of referee in these matters, but a model such as Comhairle na Tuaithe is more appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">I welcome discussion on this Bill to which the Fine Gael Party will table amendments on Committee Stage. The response of Government Deputies has been derisory and negative. We do not need a root and branch parsing of every sentence and possibility. The approach to hill walking could and should be much better. If this debate improves the position, it will have made a constructive and positive contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Let us stop being negative and work on behalf of everyone, regardless of whether they are farmers or hill walkers. Let us recognise the benefits of recreational and amenity hill walking and the rights of farmers. The consultative process is the key and must be the cornerstone of any change in legislation. Above all, let us recognise the principle of consent for all parties. This is how we will make progress and get people to work together. This is where action must be taken.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_935">I noticed the Minister's speech described someone as a "Stalinist", although the word was misspelled. He should do a spell check before printing his speeches so that he or someone else would at least learn from the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">If we are to resolve problems in the area of hill walking, we must take a constructive, practical approach. Fine Gael's position is that we should sit down together and address the matter. In a recent speech the chairman of the IFA hill farming committee, Michael Cumiskey, stated that the conflict between farmers and hill walkers in some areas is primarily related to people trying to access land without the permission of the owner. He also noted that farmers, in particular, have shown themselves capable and willing to facilitate hill walkers in many parts of the country, with walking routes agreed through a partnership approach. This approach lies at the core of the Fine Gael Party's position.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">According to Mr. Cumiskey, farmers have shown in the past that where incentives such as the REPS I scheme were in place, a number of walks were created which, through increased tourism revenue, created widespread economic benefits for the rural areas concerned. He warned, however, that any attempt to legislate access to the countryside would be fiercely resisted by landowners because the right to private property is a basic tenet of Irish society. His words offer a carrot and indicate that the IFA has constructive proposals. If it is made financially rewarding and beneficial for farmers to give their consent to hill walking, progress will be made. This is the road we must take.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_938">Although a short Bill, it is welcome because it provides an opportunity for debate. The Government is wrong to shoot it down. It should be allowed to proceed to Second Stage and perhaps Committee Stage to facilitate a full and proper debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">Problems with rights of way are not confined to rural areas. They cause more concern in housing estates built in urban areas over the past 20 years or thereabouts because they have been enclosed by such estates. The intention of the Bill was not to address this aspect of the problem but, as the explanatory memorandum states, to ensure that the listing of public rights of way becomes a mandatory function in the process of drawing up development plans. We should concentrate on this aspect of the Bill because it is from this that the current public debate arises. Other forms of rights of way, which are a distinct but serious matter, should be addressed elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Many of the difficulties with access to the countryside have arisen due to lack of communication between the two sides. I am a firm believer in dialogue as opposed to confrontation because it can solve 90% of problems. Who could have envisaged the dialogue taking place in another part of the country which may solve its problem? Dialogue cannot be bettered. If landowners, hill walkers and all those who want to enjoy the benefits of the countryside were to come together, the problem could be ironed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">Rightly or wrongly, landowners' greatest fear is that they will be liable if somebody has an accident on their land or property. If this issue were finally clarified beyond doubt, a solution to the problem would soon follow. Some people do not appreciate farmers' attachment to their property and it is difficult to explain it. Its historical basis can be traced back to the landlord era when tenants and their families were evicted from their land and homesteads. Stories of such events have been handed down. For this reason, some farmers and landowners resent people entering their property for walking purposes without first engaging in the necessary consultation process. Consultation would solve many of the problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The Bill's proposal to make the listing of public rights of way a mandatory function of the process of drawing up a county development plan would only cover official and legal rights of way. There are several types of rights of way, including private rights of way which may appear on Land Registry maps, public rights of way, access routes and walkways in use for 20 and 30 years or more. These walkways are not official rights of way but are routes to which no one objects. There are many such routes in counties such as Galway, which are subject to an established agreement between landowners, tourism interests, hill walkers and others who wish to enjoy the countryside. The legislation, if passed, could make matters worse in certain circumstances because county development plans would include only official rights of way and exclude routes which have been used for ten, 20 or 50 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">If the Bill were allowed to proceed to Committee Stage, we could iron out problems of this nature. It should at least be allowed to proceed beyond Second Stage. The Fine Gael Party, therefore, opposes the amendment which would prevent the Bill from proceeding beyond Second Stage and thereby prevent an open debate. Deputies hold different opinions on this issue. We have heard, for example, diverging opinions from Deputies in the Technical Group. This is healthy as creating opportunities for open debate is the purpose of the House. A Second Stage debate would also allow me more than four minutes to express my views and practical knowledge on the issue. It would also allow us to develop our views, apply our practical knowledge of living in urban and rural areas, debate the merits of the Bill and identify what can be done to improve matters, which may not include the introduction of a mandatory requirement in the county development plans. This will be settled around the table by farming organisations, hill walkers and others interested in walking in rural areas. Hill walkers are not out to damage land and farmers are not out to stop hill walkers enjoying a hobby they have enjoyed for generations.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_944">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I compliment Deputy Gogarty on bringing it forward. We should have a more extensive debate on the subject in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Walking is very important to tourism in Ireland. In 2003, it was worth €113 million, with 297,000 visitors and holiday makers coming to Ireland for walking purposes. That is well down from the 1999 figure of 608,000. The numbers have almost halved and there must be some reason for that. One of the reasons is that Ireland has become an expensive place to visit. However, the word is out among the walking fraternity, which is a tightly knit group, that there are problems in Ireland with rights of way. In my county, there were problems with the Dingle way, which is one of the finest walkways in the world. During the past summer, there were problems in Ballyferriter with the Three Sisters. They occasionally arose along the Kerry way. Kerry is the mecca for walking in Ireland, and in Europe it is next to the Tyrolean region in Austria. However, we experience difficulties there.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Two incidents happened this summer which created major problems. A farmer held up approximately 300 hill walkers for about 40 minutes near Enniskerry in County Wicklow. There was a famous incident in Sligo where a certain gentleman spent time in jail for preventing people from accessing his land. These incidents have been well publicised and they are creating a problem. In 1993, I introduced a Private Members' Bill called the Protection of Occupiers of Land Bill. This was very stark legislation, but it was welcomed by the farming community that time because it was very clear. It was more or less included in the Occupiers Liability Act 1995. That legislation created a new type of visitor or land user called the recreational user. That category was put in place to allay the fears of farmers. It reduced the duty of care that a farmer had towards a trespasser on his property. There was, however, a recent court decision over an incident near Bundoran in County Donegal and the 1995 Act is being interpreted by the Supreme Court. This decision will be very important and if it goes against the landowner, we will have a major problem because it will close off rural Ireland to a great extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">It is interesting that we do not have many agreed rights of way in this country. There is access to well visited places like Staigue Fort, Gallarus Oratory, but there is no right of way. There is an agreement with the owner and it is only because of the owner's goodwill that people are allowed to use that area. The owner can close that at any time. If this case goes against the landowner, many people will be very concerned about it and many of those places could be closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">Roaming is not mentioned in this Bill, but it is a far more emotive issue with hill walkers than rights of way. In the past, people liked to roam around commonages, across mountains, reeks, Slieve Mish and the Paps, across the country. Recently, because of the division of commonage and for other reasons, roamers have been challenged, and that has given cause for concern. This issue is ready to explode. There are warning signs and the issue should not be trivialised the way it has been. I have walked hills all over the world——</p>

          <p eId="para_953">There is a need to provide walkways in the countryside and in towns. While the emphasis here is on the rural aspect, the issue of towns has been raised by several people and it is equally as important. I believe that with a little lateral thinking, we could address some of the difficulties. When we give out sports grants to GAA clubs and soccer clubs, we should stipulate that the clubs provide a track around the pitch. In Ballymore Eustace, County Kildare, there is a floodlit track which is used extensively at night time.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Many groups are to blame for the problems that exist. In many cases, local authorities have listed public rights of way that do not exist. Some advertise routes on which there is no agreement. Lanes are put into local authority housing areas which cause difficulties later. Such problems can be avoided. There are also difficulties with landowners who block routes. I am alienating every group at the moment, which is something a politician should not do, but walkers are sometimes not without fault. I know of a case where a number of walkers are allowed to go walking in State owned land in Wicklow. This has been overrun on occasion. The Enniskerry case is well publicised. I am not familiar with the exact details, but it would not be advisable for 300 people to walk in the mountains.</p>

          <p eId="para_958">That is fair enough. In my days in the Army, we always made sure to break up if we were going on a route march over the Wicklow hills. I disagree with Deputy Deenihan in that Wicklow is the mecca of walking.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">This Bill is not simple. Deputy McCormack covered the issues of public and private rights of way. Deputy Ryan said that he walked from Dundrum to the Dublin mountains for 30 years. That does not necessarily mean that it is a public right of way. I am happy to support this Bill, but substantial amendments will be required on Committee Stage. The first amendment should be to put the onus on the local authority to establish the location of the right of way. Be it a 500 acre farm in Tipperary, Wicklow or Kerry or a garden in Ballsbridge, people generally do not like people to trample on their grass. That is a fact that is not exclusive to the country as it is also applicable to towns. Local authorities should be responsible for this matter. They have been negligent to date in designating routes that do not exist. The concerns of farmers and landowners must also be addressed in the Bill. I have been approached by people who never knew that a route through their property was marked in a development plan until someone pointed it out to them. That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">It is important to realise that, in the final analysis, the vast majority of walkers and landowners are reasonable. Where there is a will, there is a way. The Wicklow Way, which stretches for 83 miles through lands owned by over 120 people in County Wicklow, has been successful because no legal claims have been made since it was established. I will conclude by stating the success of the Wicklow Way demonstrates that such routes can work. I welcome the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 because it focuses attention on an problem which has the potential to grow. I ask the Government to re-examine its refusal to support it.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_969">Amendment No. 30, which proposes that "the Minister shall lay a Report before the Houses of the Oireachtas detailing the propriety in the operation of passports for sale schemes in the State", attempts to ensure we do not bring an end to the passports for sale schemes without compiling a proper report on them. Such a report may detail the impropriety of their operation. The amendment seeks to inform the public of what happened under their terms before they are consigned to history.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">The Minister mentioned in his earlier response that he had reported to the Taoiseach after he had conducted an investigation into the matter. He said the report referred, in particular, to one of the most notorious applications, made in the early days of the scheme, when Ray Burke was Minister for Justice and Charles J. Haughey was Taoiseach. The unsigned citizenship applications lodged by Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz and ten others, which arrived in the Department of Justice on 6 December 1990, were returned to the applicants that day to be signed by them the following day. Although the applicants were abroad at the time, the applications were returned to the Department the following day, allegedly having been signed by the applicants. The entire process was marked by such a slipshod approach. While the applications did not comply with the terms of any scheme, the political connivance which marked the applications process was even worse. The passports were issued before the naturalisation papers had been signed.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Everybody knows about the matters to which I have referred, but certain similar issues have not been highlighted. In his reply earlier the Minister did not refer to the three Irish citizens who had provided character references for Sheikh Mahfouz and his associates. I understand it was required at the time that every application be accompanied by three character references from Irish citizens, but details of the referees have not emerged in this instance. Perhaps that was another aspect of the applications process which was not properly upheld. Such information needs to be disclosed.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I would like to raise another aspect of the Sheikh Mahfouz case in which I am interested. The certificates of naturalisation and passports were handed over on 8 December 1990, two days after the initial application had been made. The original applications were returned to the applicants on the evening they were made, 6 December 1990, and delivered to the Department the following day. A funny thing happened after the certificates of naturalisation and passports had been given to the people in question by the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, and the then Minister for Justice, Ray Burke, at a function in the Shelbourne Hotel on 8 December 1990. It was required at the time that the granting of naturalisation and the issuing of passports had to be recorded in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. By some strange coincidence or otherwise, the notice of the granting of the hurriedly arranged passports to Sheikh Mahfouz did not appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> until two years later, on 4 September 1992.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Such issues have not been teased out or considered. Who was responsible for the delay? Who arranged the publication of the notice in question? This case is just one of a series in which passports were issued in dubious circumstances. It is obvious that all the rules, regulations and guidelines were not upheld. It is probable that the laws of the time were broken. I am in favour of the section of this Bill which brings the scheme to an end, but it is not right that it is being done without a proper explanation of what happened in this and other cases in which passports were issued under the scheme. I refer, in particular, to cases in the early days of the scheme, when activity of the kind I have mentioned was common.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">I do not question the judgment of later Ministers who granted passports. The administrative procedures introduced by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn when Minister for Justice were properly followed thereafter. Ministers used their judgment in later years when deciding whether to grant passports, based on whether it was in the interests of the State. I am not interested in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">I have given the reasons for my amendment. The Minister accepts he has the same interest in unearthing the facts and that there should not be a whitewash. He agrees there was considerable impropriety, if not clear illegality, in the granting of some passports. Therefore, I hope he is prepared to agree to the sprit of my amendment, if not its wording. Does he accept there should be a proper examination of such activities and that a report should be produced? I will be delighted if Judge Moriarty succeeds in producing such a report, but I am worried that he may not be able to do so, particularly as a timeframe for the completion of the tribunal's deliberations has been discussed with him, if not imposed on him. It would not be in the interests of our democratic system to bring this scheme to an end without producing a full and complete report on it. I will pursue my amendment on that basis.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_402">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_976">We have teased out this important matter well. I fully support Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment, which proposes that a report be produced on the passports for sale scheme, which involved the granting of naturalisation in return for investment. The Minister has taken the first step in that regard by putting the relevant file in the possession of the Moriarty tribunal, which I hope will be able to deal with the question of propriety or impropriety. Perhaps there is no other way of dealing with the serious matters which have to be resolved. Do we know how many passports went missing, for example? We know the CIA was in possession of Irish passports and that they were used to travel the world at a particular time under a particular Administration. We do not know how they got their hands on Irish passports. What of those travelling the world on Irish passports obtained through the investment-based naturalisation scheme who have besmirched the good name of this country and are sought in a number of countries for fraud and other criminal activities? The person most mentioned is Mr. Kozeny, the Czech born businessman wanted in the United States and in Czechoslovakia for multi-million pound fraud. We understand from them he would be in prison if he could be caught. Mr. Kozeny intended to stand in the European elections on the basis of his Irish citizenship.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">One cannot leave all this hanging in limbo and say that everything is hunky-dory because we have put an end to this process. We should take whatever steps are needed to ensure this does not happen again. I suggest that as well as investigating those who obtained such passports, the Minister should investigate those who gave the passports to them. We know that corners were cut in processing those passports but we need to know by whom they were processed and if any impropriety took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Will the Minister assure this House that if the Moriarty tribunal is not in a position to deal with this matter because of strictures on its time and operations, he will put in place another mechanism to do so either through his Department or by way of commission of investigation under the legislation enacted last year?</p>

          <p eId="para_983">It should be noted that passport was issued in good faith by former Deputy Nora Owen. The question of revoking that passport is complex. The mere fact that one is being sought in connection with an investigation is not a ground for revocation of a passport. The only ground on which there can be revocation of citizenship granted on foot of a certificate is where the person subsequently obtains citizenship of another country. That is an issue which I will examine in light of matters referred to by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">Deputy O'Keeffe must remember that he was a member of the Government in which the then Minister for Justice had on her desk, for a number of years a report dealing with the issues now being raised yet nothing was done about it. It now becomes imperative in his mind that I, many years later when the Moriarty tribunal is dealing with the same issue, conduct a parallel and independent investigation. The question that has to be asked is what was it between 1994 and 1997 that produced total paralysis on this issue when no political connection of those involved held office at the time. I will not add to that except to say that it is easy in retrospect to develop moral fervour and indignation on a subject, strangely absent at a more proximate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">I have put, as fairly and concisely as I can, my doubt as to whether the 11 passports to which the Deputies referred were issued appropriately and with propriety. I have put on the record of this House, the other House and to committees of the Houses my grave misgivings on this subject. The notion that I should somehow within three months produce a report which will resolve the issues with which the Moriarty tribunal is currently dealing is far-fetched. I have done my level best in this area. No Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been as forthright as I in these matters, has brought the system to an end as quickly as the opportunity presented itself or has dealt as fairly or as squarely with the inadequacies of what happened at a time before he or she was Minister. I ask myself why it is that Deputy O'Keeffe can now demand of me something he never demanded of his party colleague when in my position. I am mystified by that question. We spoke earlier of curiosity and partisanship. I will be a very happy man when it is explained to me precisely why demands are made of me that were not made of Deputy O'Keeffe's colleagues.</p>

          <p eId="para_996">I was not Minister for Justice during 1994-97 and was not in a position to personally investigate this matter. That is a matter of fact. However, I have raised questions on this issue on numerous occasions before the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took office. I do so again from the point of public interest. I do not believe it is in the interests of this State, which is founded and based on the rule of law, that practices should take place outside the rule of that law. Such practices were condoned and in many instances instigated by leading politicians in this State — I am not pointing the finger at you but at members of his partners in Government, the Fianna Fáil Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">I appreciate I should address my remarks through the Chair. Clearly practices were engaged in that were not just unethical but illegal. As a parliamentarian, I say it is not proper that we should pass from this spot without putting in place some mechanism to ensure the issue is properly aired, investigated and dealt with. I have the greatest faith in the Moriarty tribunal to do so, if it has the time. I agree the tribunals need to be put on the track of completion. However, I am concerned that in adopting such an approach, the Moriarty tribunal may not have the time to finish this job. That is why I tabled the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform points his figure at me when saying he does not want to spend the next three months solely addressing this issue. If he did, he would not have the time for his three times a day press conferences or the other issues that engage him. While I understand his position, I do not expect him to do the groundwork on such a report. Two options are available to us. My proposal which would put an onus on the Minister to ensure the issues were fully aired and dealt with can be accepted. Alternatively, we can go the other way, closing the book. If we do this, there is the danger that these issues will be buried with the scheme and the public will not get the information to which it is entitled. I indicated I was agreeable to a longer period or a different format, if the Minister wished it. However, I cannot accept burying all the improprieties and illegalities under the passports for sale scheme. That is the wrong approach.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_1090">I move amendment No. 33<i>a</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1091">In page 12, line 12, after "information" to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1092">"or if, following the issue of the certificate, the person is sentenced, on conviction in the State or elsewhere, for a criminal offence, to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years".</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">We touched on this amendment during the earlier debate on passports for sale. The issue is slightly different here in that the Minister tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to allow the holder of his office to revoke a certificate of nationality if he or she is satisfied the certificate was obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, including innocent misrepresentation, or failure to disclose material information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">My amendment seeks to provide for additional powers of revocation where, following the issue of the certificate, a person is sentenced on conviction in the State or elsewhere for a criminal offence to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years. While I acknowledge the reluctance of the Minister to revoke a passport if something happens subsequent to its issue, those obtained under the passports for sale scheme have given rise to many questions and much suspicion about the manner and propriety of granting them in some instances. Where a person obtains an Irish passport and is convicted in the State or elsewhere of a criminal offence attracting a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years, the passport should be revoked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">As the Minister knows, it is not possible to revoke the passport of an Irish-born citizen. My amendment refers to the investment-based naturalisation process. It seeks to address a future event where a person who innocently obtained a passport issued in good faith, as many were, violates the conditions on which it was issued. Such passports were issued on condition that the persons being granted them would be loyal to the country and faithful to its good name and would maintain a firm, strong connection with the State. The Minister has often referred to this last condition. If, having bought a passport by investing here, someone undermines his or her connection to the country by committing a crime of fraud or robbery, he or she should not be entitled to retain the document.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">We should look into cases where passports have been obtained by people who are fugitives from justice. In regard to the number of passports granted, does the Minister know whether there have been convictions of the people who have got them? We must put a value on our passport and our citizenship. When somebody comes here and effectively purchases a passport from the country, the very least we should do is ensure he or she does not abuse or misuse it for fraudulent or criminal purposes. We should endeavour to keep tabs on passports and revoke them if they are abused or misused.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_424">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1097">The revocation of citizenship and, therefore, the withdrawal of a passport is a very serious matter and one that should not be entered into lightly. I had hoped, in the context of my earlier amendment, that we would have had the full report based on which we could come to decisions for further investigations that might lead to revocation of citizenship of some of the individuals involved. We will not have that now but we must hope that the Moriarty tribunal may have the time and the opportunity to furnish a report to this House on the operation of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">There is a provision which gives the State, in certain circumstances, the entitlement to withdraw citizenship and a passport. A volume of evidence is available that at least suggests a proper investigation can be carried out as to whether such proceedings should be started in some circumstances. Dealing with this issue from the outside, as I have always done, I cannot go further than that. I appreciate that the difficulty of gathering the evidence may be considerable. In some instances there may have been no convictions. In others it may be difficult to prove the existence of convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">There is considerable evidence that some of the people concerned have been involved in various scams throughout the world. Some of them were involved in the major BCII bank scam involving billions of dollars. In that instance, I understand there were proceedings in the United States which led to a cash settlement of $225 million, following which certain charges were dropped on some type of plea bargain basis. Another instance involved a character to whom we granted citizenship during that period where there was a conviction in the United States and a process regarding fitness to practise as a doctor. There were other such instances on which some evidence was available but that evidence would need to be gathered. From the early 1990s there is some evidence of a recipient being involved in a $5 million tax scam in Chicago. I am quoting from earlier research I had done into this area but I accept that may not amount to sufficient evidence. Hard evidence would be needed to bring the necessary proceedings for revocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">This goes back to the basic point that we should not have ended this scheme without at least making an effort to secure such evidence. My attitude to this amendment is the same as my attitude to the last one. This is one of the issues that remains outstanding following the ending of the scheme and one that we should not leave hanging. If evidence exists, we should pursue it and if it does not, we have to leave matters lie.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_425" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1101">There seems to be a misunderstanding, and it is a fundamental one, as to what we are talking about. There are two forms of certificates provided for under the 1956 Act. One is a certificate of naturalisation and the other is a certificate of nationality. The Deputies will be aware that under section 19 of the 1956 Act, provision is made for the revocation of certificates of naturalisation. The circumstances in which a certificate of naturalisation can be revoked are as follows: first, that the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation — whether innocent or fraudulent — or concealment of material facts or circumstances; second, that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself or herself to have failed in his or her duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State; third, except in the case of a certificate of naturalisation granted to a person of Irish decent or associations, the person to whom it has been granted has been ordinarily resident outside the State in certain circumstances for a continuous period of seven years without reasonable excuse and has not, during that period, registered themselves annually in a prescribed manner; fourth, that the person to whom it is granted is also under the law of a country at war with the State; or, fifth, that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act other than marriage acquired another citizenship. That last ground may be of relevance to the "bouncing Czech" case we heard about earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">Before revocation of a certificate of naturalisation, the Minister shall give such notice as is prescribed to the person to whom the certificate was granted of his intention to revoke the certificate, giving the grounds and the right of that person to apply to the Minister for an inquiry as to the reasons for the revocation. On application being made in the prescribed manner for an inquiry, the Minister shall refer the matter to a committee of inquiry appointed by the Minister consisting of a chairman having judicial experience and such other persons as the Minister may think fit, and the committee shall report its findings to the Minister. Where there is entered in a certificate of naturalisation granted to a person under the 1935 Act the name of the child of that person, such entry shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be a certificate of naturalisation under the Act of 1935. Finally, a certificate of naturalisation granted or deemed under section 4 to have been granted under the Act of 1935 may be revoked in accordance with the provisions of this section and upon such revocation, that person shall cease to be an Irish citizen. Notice of the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. Those are the procedures for people who have been granted a certificate of naturalisation. Due process is granted to them and they cannot have their certificate taken from them except in the circumstances I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Unfortunately, the draftsman of Deputy Costello's amendment conflated certificates of naturalisation with certificates of nationality. Certificates of nationality are a totally different form of certificate. They are issued to a different category of persons as follows: any person who claims to be an Irish citizen — this part is very important — other than a naturalised Irish citizen may apply to the Minister or, if resident outside the island of Ireland, to any Irish diplomatic officer or consular officer for a certificate of nationality stating that the applicant is, at the date of the certificate, an Irish citizen and the Minister or officer, if satisfied (a) that the person is an Irish citizen and (b) that the issue of the certificate is necessary in all the circumstances of the case, may issue a certificate of nationality to him or her accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">Under section 28, we are dealing with an entirely different creature from a certificate of naturalisation. This is available to somebody who has not been naturalised by a ministerial certificate or who has never applied to the Minister. Anybody who has applied such as those who availed of the passports for investment scheme cannot apply for a certificate under this section. They are entitled to a certificate of nationality, if necessary. My amendment allows the Minister to revoke the latter certificate if procured through misrepresentation or fraud. However, it does not have the effects about which the Deputies are canvassing. In particular, Mr. Koseni or anybody else naturalised under the passports for investment scheme could not avail of such a certificate, nor could the Minister revoke it. The certificate of naturalisation is revocable following due process under section 19 of the 1956 Act while the certificate of nationality is a totally different animal. It is evidence that one is an Irish citizen. It is available to persons who are not naturalised Irish citizens to prove their nationality which derives from a different basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">Deputy Costello is barking up the wrong tree. While the points he made are interesting, he should have tabled an amendment to section 19 of the 1956 Act. His amendment is misplaced because nobody granted citizenship by a Minister would be caught in any circumstance. The point has been missed. The term "certificate of nationality" has been confused with the term "certificate of naturalisation". They are two different animals and revoking one would have no effect on the other. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1106">The Minister is correct that there is confusion. Following due process, can a certificate of naturalisation be revoked by the Minister in certain circumstances? If somebody acquires a passport through an investment based process and has besmirched the good name of the passport through criminal activity, can he or she be deprived of it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_427" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1107">If the Deputy wanted to provide for an additional ground relating to a person convicted of an offence carrying a ten year sentence in a court anywhere in the world, he should have tabled an amendment to section 19(1) of the 1956 Act. Whether it would be proper to do so is a separate question because under international conventions there is a prohibition on divesting people of their citizenship if they commit a serious offence. If an Irish person is convicted, say, of rape in France and given a 12 year sentence, that does not empower the Minister to suddenly revoke his or her citizenship. Under international law, I am not entitled to make a radically different decision about somebody who was naturalised, say, at the age of two years and deprive him or her of his or her citizenship because he or she has been convicted of a serious offence in Ireland or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">It could have serious consequences if the Minister were to do so in Ireland. I refer, for example, to a child naturalised under our law who commits an offence carrying a ten year sentence in our courts. Would it be right that the day after he is sent to Mountjoy Prison to commence his sentence, I should suddenly revoke his citizenship and deprive him of his nationality? Why would that be just or fair? The fact that somebody was naturalised at the age of 21 or 22 years and was convicted of an offence carrying a ten year sentence in an Irish or foreign court at the age of 55 or 60 years would not permit such a draconian act to be committed in respect of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">When the person to whom Deputy O'Keeffe referred was naturalised in 1995 by the former Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, evidence was supplied by both the United States and the Czech Republic that he had no criminal record. The only basis — it may be substantial — on which that person could be deprived of his citizenship would be under section 19(1)(<i>e</i>), whereby the person to whom citizenship was granted had by a voluntary act acquired another citizenship after he or she had been granted Irish citizenship.</p>

          <p eId="para_1114">The circumstances in which Irish citizens seek certificates of nationality, which happens three or four times a year, are rare. One recent example was an application by an Irish-born woman who wanted to get married in Bosnia. The Bosnian authorities insisted on a certificate of nationality, despite the fact that she was a holder of an Irish passport. It is likely that this requirement arises because of the widespread use of forged passports in the modern era. Another Irish-born citizen recently required such a certificate for the purpose of having his third level qualifications recognised in Italy. His passport would not suffice for the authorities there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">There are circumstances in which an Irish citizen who holds an Irish passport may require a certificate. When the Bill is enacted, certain children born in Northern Ireland to non-EEA national parents who have reckonable residence in that jurisdiction will be required to apply for a certificate of nationality prior to the acquisition of an Irish passport. The reason for this is essentially administrative. British immigration stamps show evidence of residence in the United Kingdom, but do not show evidence of residence in Northern Ireland as such. The child's cousin, born to its parents in similar circumstances but resident in the State, will not require a certificate of nationality prior to the acquisition of an Irish passport because Irish immigration stamps constitute evidence of residence in the State.</p>

I consider that the legislation should be quite specific on this point as regards territoriality, particularly having regard to the likelihood that many applications relating to citizenship issues will be made at Irish diplomatic and consular offices abroad. Effectively I am saying there should be an extra territorial dimension to the offence provided for in section 15 of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1141">I have had time to consider it. However, the more I considered it the more resolute I became that I would not accept it. I oppose this amendment because it seeks to prevent the coming into effect of the new law on Irish citizenship by birth on the island of Ireland until a period of ten months has elapsed since the power to make the new law was signed into our Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">Ten months is a considerable period and is exactly one month longer than another notable period. I had to ask myself what possible good would be served by such a restriction. Is it the case that the Labour Party wishes to accommodate those who heard about the proposed change in Irish citizenship and set about begetting a child as quickly as possible so as to avail themselves of the old rules before the new ones came into effect? Is there some suggestion that those who did so had a legitimate expectation at the time that they started the process that the new rules would not apply to them?</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">I cannot accept that there should be any moratorium imposed on the date of coming into effect of the new rules. Were it possible for the new arrangements to come into effect straight away without further ado, there would be no commencement order provision in this Bill. However, that is not the case. There will have to be subsidiary legislation to set out the forms of declaration to be made, particularly with regard to Northern Ireland matters, to specify the types of documentation needed to be produced for such declarations and the like, in particular in the limited number of cases where entitlement to Irish citizenship will depend in whole or in part on reckonable residence in the North. Although preliminary work is under way on those regulations, there will be a minimum delay in preparing them and in commencing the new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">What Deputy Costello is essentially saying is that although the Irish people spoke 80:20 in a referendum, there should be one month in which those who saw this decisive step on Irish citizenship should have one last throw of the dice — I cannot put it more aptly — to beget an Irish child and that they should have ten months in which to produce the Irish child.

          <p eId="para_1150">Citizenship by birth continues until this Bill is enacted, yet the perception here and abroad has been that once the referendum was passed the birthright of citizenship ceased. There is not a phalanx of people out there who decided that because the legislation had not gone through this was an opportunity for them to beget an Irish child. People did not know it had not gone through. Probably less than 5% of the population know that the situation remains the same until the legislation is signed into law by the President. They all thought it changed totally and irrevocably once the referendum was passed and that it did not need legislation to empower it.</p>

Has the Minister considered whether he should deal with that? The amendment deals with the children in the pipeline. I wanted to raise the issue and to get the Minister's response.

In order to have a birthright one has to be born. Therefore, the concept of citizenship based on birth does not apply to children, wherever conceived. If that were the case, can one imagine the confusion internationally as parents argued that this particular child started here rather than there and that they well remember the day or night that all these events took place? We have to deal with the straightforward issue of where one is born, not where one came into existence pre-birth.</p>

            <from>Ms Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_1235">I appreciate the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has come to the House to deal with this matter. The motion refers to the urgent need for Aer Lingus to resume its cargo and courier operations due to the devastating effect the suspension of these services has on businesses in the Munster region, in particular Irish businesses which have to resort to purchasing seats on aeroplanes for staff to transport goods to clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">This is probably not clear to people who are not involved in this area. The cargo operation which has been run by Aer Lingus out of Cork Airport was due to be withdrawn on 1 January next. The businesses in the region were hugely upset by this because they realised very quickly that it would have a devastating effect on the cargo business in the Munster region. We have been asking for some considerable time that Aer Lingus reconsider its position. However, on 20 November the cargo service was withdrawn much earlier than expected because Swissport, the international carrier used by Aer Lingus, went into liquidation. The decision of Aer Lingus to suspend cargo operations has a devastating effect on many Irish-based exporting companies, some of which are resorting to sending goods on aeroplanes with passengers in the absence of the courier service, which Aer Lingus operated on a flexible basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">In recent days, businesses in Cork have had to cope without Aer Lingus cargo operations. When the company announced the decision in August, I warned that the move would have serious negative consequences for companies based in Cork, particularly export companies, including important multinationals, and so it has transpired. The impact is much worse than initially feared as not only have all cargo operations ceased but Aer Lingus's hitherto flexible courier service is a thing of the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">Companies based in the Munster region are being forced to send staff members on flights to get goods or products to clients. The additional costs incurred and manpower wasted will surely force many companies to rethink whether they wish to be based in the region. As a national airline in public ownership, there should be an obligation on Aer Lingus management to have regard for the broader national interest. Both the company and the Government should take note of the warning from the Irish Exporters Association that if distribution out of Ireland becomes difficult, companies will move to Holland, France or Germany where distribution is easier.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">There is much focus on the future of Aer Lingus. Developments such as these raise further serious questions about the wisdom of privatisation. Aer Lingus has a duty to supply these services and I call on the company to reverse the decision to abandon its cargo and courier services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">I received a letter from a freight company which operates successfully from the airport business park in Cork. It states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1241">Regarding Aer Lingus cargo closure I am getting a lot of panic calls from both clients and companies we have not dealt with in the past concerning this closure. The more well known companies such as EMC/Apple/Resound/ADM/Johnson &amp;  Johnson are now very concerned with the closure. Aer Lingus have already suspended cargo operations since last Monday due to their handling agent Swissport going into liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">The companies are now feeling its effect. The courier operation, which was flexible in nature, has also gone. The letter gave an example of its impact. One client had to put a member of staff on a morning flight to London — they were lucky to get the seat — to carry an item worth €10, and the ticket cost €220. There were also incidental expenses, such as having lunch and waiting for a return flight. No company can sustain such costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">People in Cork are getting sick and tired of what happens to them when something goes wrong with Aer Lingus in Dublin. I am not demeaning the fact that the national carrier at one stage refused to carry the bodies of people who wished to be buried in Ireland. It is a sensitive subject. However, this decision is equally important for the Munster region. The Minister should call on the board of Aer Lingus to reverse the decision as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_463">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1244">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. It is a matter in which I, too, have considerable interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The decision taken by Aer Lingus on cargo handling was an operational matter for that organisation and was outside the scope of direct political intervention. However, a central element of the Government's economic development policies is to ensure that Irish exporters are facilitated in all relevant aspects of their business dealings. It is for that reason that Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and other such agencies are resourced by taxpayers through the Government. Their task is to ensure that companies producing goods and services, and providing valuable employment in this country, can fully realise opportunities that exist in export markets across the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">I am aware of, and am concerned about, reports of difficulties arising at Heathrow Airport as a consequence of the recent demise of the cargo handling agent there for Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus is working to resolve this problem. It has put in place some interim handling arrangements pending the selection of a new cargo handling agent. I am hopeful these efforts will ensure that the cargo handling arrangements at Heathrow Airport will soon be fully operational again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">In so far as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is concerned, Enterprise Ireland has been asked to continue to monitor and to report on the situation. It is to undertake a telephone survey of exporting companies to provide a representative and contemporary indication of continuing problems that such companies are experiencing as a consequence of difficulties in accessing cargo handling services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">While I am aware of reports that difficulties have arisen in recent weeks with exports destined for Heathrow Airport, information available to the Department indicates that this problem is of recent origin and that its negative impact is relatively confined and localised. That in no way lessens its importance or detracts from the Minister's determination to resolve any and all obstacles that inhibit or have the potential to inhibit the further development and deepening of our bilateral trading performance in markets around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">However, it is important also to indicate that both the Department and Enterprise Ireland have been monitoring whether negative and widespread effects have emerged since the decision of Aer Lingus on its cargo handling activities. That monitoring indicates that other cargo handling operators have taken up available business and that there have been few negative effects on our exporters as a consequence. Equally, neither the Department nor Enterprise Ireland has, in so far as I am aware, received representations from companies that have been negatively affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">The Government regards the promotion and development of exports as vital to our economic well-being. We will ensure that the necessary supports and facilities are available to exporting companies to realise and maximise the possibilities in all countries with which we have trading relationships. To do so, we are anxious to know of all difficulties that negatively impinge on the realisation of these objectives and are determined to solve them.</p>

          <heading>Health Board Services.</heading>
          <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_464">
            <from>Mr. Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_1251">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter, the primary care strategy and the Mid-Western Health Board's implementation project, Cois Abhainn in west Limerick. This is one of the pilot projects aimed at commencing implementation of the national primary care strategy model of care, providing an opportunity to experiment with ways of delivering a multi-disciplinary primary care team service, and we welcome it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The Cois Abhainn project encompasses a geographic area of 200 square miles approximately, spanning the coastal rural region west from Foynes to Tarbert, inland to Athea and including Glin. The area includes the north Kerry-Southern Health Board region around Tarbert. There are four general practitioners participating and I pay tribute to them. They are Dr. Brendan Barrett, Dr. Dominic Lehane, Dr. Kieran Murphy and Dr. Michael Tagney. The population to be served by the primary care team is approximately 8,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">An additional 13 posts have been approved for the primary care team. A number of these have been filled and others are being recruited at present. Perhaps the Minister will outline the situation regarding this recruitment. Resource improvements cover public health nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, therapy assistance, dietetics, home helps and administrative support. Absent from this excellent project are psychiatric and psychological services. No psychiatric services are provided for the area. Are there plans to include psychiatric services when rolling out the national scheme?</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">ICT has played a key role in maximising the responsiveness and accessibility of the service. Communication is the linchpin of primary care team implementation. All sites have been fully networked through the Mid-Western Health Board systems. Communication through telephone and e-mail is now established at each location where personnel in the primary care team are based. Many of the staff involved never had access to ICT and training is geared to individual needs. The development of multi-disciplinary records and shared access to multi-disciplinary electronic records are issues which will require both national and local consideration in the future. Has progress been made in the development of these multi-disciplinary electronic records?</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">Shared care protocols have been initiated by the team. Diabetes has been identified as the initial area for establishing protocols. Interfaces with other services are being pursued with the mental health services and services for older people through engagement in their service development processes. Services to the public have been enhanced since the implementation of the Cois Abhainn project. The population now has access to local dedicated physiotherapy, occupational therapy and dietetics services. Provision of aids and appliances identified as necessary to enhance quality of life for clients by these therapists will be provided for the population based on agreed criteria. All members of the primary care team have access to improved information and communication systems, ensuring rapid and confidential information exchange, which underpins co-ordinated responses to needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Team-building has provided opportunities for team members to get to know all other disciplines in the team and understand and appreciate each other's roles, expertise and skills. This enhances the ability of all professionals to identify resources and referral options within the team. This allows for greater treatment options, leading to potentially better outcomes for clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">A significant amount of work needs to be completed in order to conclude the implementation phase of the Cois Abhainn project. Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the progress in respect of and the commitment to the tasks involved which include more in-depth needs analysis; further recruitment to the primary care team; further team-building; further education and training; development of the remaining protocols and pathways; further development of interfaces with the wider primary, community and continuing care services and acute care; ICT development for registration-enrolment, etc.; physical infrastructural development; managing equity in the system of access to and provision of services; and advancements in the quality programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">I pay tribute to the director of primary care, Ms Mary Healy, of the Mid-Western Health Board for the work done in initiating this excellent primary care project.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_465">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1259">The primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, sets out the Government's vision for the development of integrated multidisciplinary primary care teams and networks that will enable clients to access a broad range of services in their local community. The aim of the strategy is to develop the capacity of primary care to meet the broad range of health and social care needs appropriate to the primary care setting. A strengthened primary care system can have a major impact in reducing demands on specialist services and the hospital system, particularly accident and emergency and outpatient services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The strategy provided for the early establishment of a number of initial primary care teams on the basis of the model described in it. The more widespread implementation of the model will be able to draw on experience gained through the development and operation of these first teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">In 2002 the Department sought proposals from the health boards for the establishment of primary care teams with a view to funding a number of such projects. The Mid-Western Health Board brought forward three such proposals and, following discussions between the Department and the board, approval was granted to the development of the Cois Abhainn primary care team in west County Limerick. This team serves an area of approximately 20 square miles spanning the coastal rural area from Foynes to Tarbert and inland to Athea and Glin. The population served includes residents of the Tarbert area in County Kerry. The Mid-Western Health Board has indicated that the target population of this primary care team is approximately 8,000 persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">At the outset the Mid-Western Health Board which has responsibility for the development of the team established a steering group representative of all major service elements to guide the establishment of the Cois Abhainn primary care team. There has been substantial progress to date with its development. The commitment of the front-line health professionals and the health board management and staff involved with the team who have devoted considerable effort to its development must be acknowledged. The team has been established by building on the services and resources already in place in the areas involved in order to develop a primary care team in line with the model described in the strategy. The necessary revenue funding to enable the appointment of 13 additional personnel to make up the full team has been provided. Once-off capital funding of €135,000 and a further €155,000 in respect of information and communications technology supports for the team has also been provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">The team involves five general practitioners based in four practices — at Athea, Glin, Foynes and Tarbert — their staff and health board professionals working together as a primary care team. Accommodation has been developed at the refurbished Glin Health Centre which has facilitated the provision of an integrated team service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">The broad range of services being provided by the Cois Abhainn primary care team for the local community includes general practitioner services; public health, community and practice nursing services; physiotherapy; occupational therapy; therapy assistance; home help; dietetics, and community welfare services. Other facilities at Carrigkerry, Shanagolden and Ballyhahill will continue to provide satellite bases for outreach general practice services for the local populations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">The team is working with the west Limerick resources organisation, a well established community development group, in undertaking a local needs assessment and developing consumer panels and a model for community involvement in the planning of primary care services. Links are also being developed with the west Limerick rural transport initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">The Hanly report recognised the important contribution primary care can make to the provision of quality patient care. In that context, earlier this year my Department requested the Mid-Western Health Board, as one of the two phase 1 implementation regions for the Hanly reorganisation, to consider the primary care developments required to support the reconfiguration of hospital services in the region. The board has conducted a structured and comprehensive analysis to map a broad range of data, including demographic information, disease patterns, socio-economic indices, mental health indicators, locations of existing public health services, GP practices, transport links and existing natural communities. I express my appreciation of the work the health board has undertaken in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">As a result of this detailed work, the board has developed a draft plan for the implementation of the primary care strategy in its region. The plan proposes 11 primary care networks consisting of 37 primary care teams. The next stage will be to undertake a comprehensive consultation process with general practitioners and other relevant interests in the region and revise the plan as appropriate in consultation with the stakeholders. This process is due to commence in the new year.</p>

          <heading>Rural Transport Services.</heading>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_466">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1268">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">It is widely acknowledged that public transport in this State is hugely inadequate and that the failure of successive Governments to develop public transport is adversely affecting our economy and the quality of life of our citizens. This is just as acute a problem in rural areas as it is in our cities. Inadequate as much of public transport is in our cities, it is at least present. There is no public transport throughout vast swathes of rural Ireland, unless one counts the inter-city buses that serve only the national routes and large towns. That is the situation in my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, which contains some of the most disadvantaged and isolated rural communities in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">For the reasons I have outlined, the rural transport initiative has become an absolutely essential service for those rural communities where it is available. It provides a transport service for people in isolated areas, allowing them regular access to services, employment and health care. It has breathed new life into entire communities and provided an essential lifeline for some who would otherwise have faced terminal decline. For example, in the last ten months the Flexibus Meath Accessible Transport Project which covers County Meath has carried over 16,000 people on 18 daily and weekly service routes. More than 50% of its passengers have no access to alternative transport services and would not be able to get to local shops or the doctor without this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">There are similar projects in my constituency, including those run by Kilnaleck and District Community Co-operative in County Cavan, Rural Lift which serves parts of west Cavan and County Leitrim, and Latton Social Services and Development Limited in County Monaghan. I commend all involved in each of these essential initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">While I welcome the €3 million allocated to the rural transport initiative in the recently published Book of Estimates, it is clear that this is simply not enough. It is far from enough. With this level of funding, projects will not be able to sustain their current services, not to mention expand them in order to meet demand. What is urgently needed tomorrow — budget day — is a further allocation of at least €2 million for the rural transport initiative. I appeal to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State opposite to make this funding available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">In the context of the massive spending on national roads, Luas trams, the Dublin Port tunnel and other such projects, the allocation for the rural transport initiative is truly minuscule. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, announced on 7 October that the initiative was to be extended for a further two years to the end of 2006. However, we should not be talking about merely extending such schemes; we should be talking about mainstreaming them and establishing an integrated rural transport system to serve our communities. Such a system should not be focused only on the elderly and people with disabilities and other special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">One of the reasons for the carnage on the roads of rural Ireland at the weekends is the total dependence on private cars for transport to and from social outings. The rural transport initiative is filling real gaps. It needs to be supported and the starting point for a real public transport network in rural Ireland which should be imaginative and involve communities, local businesses, the local authorities and CIE. I urge the Minister of State to support this initiative and increase the funding allocated to it in tomorrow's Budget Statement.</p>

            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_1275">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht an ábhair tábhachtach seo a phlé sa Dáil agus tá suim againn ann i gCondae an Chláirfreisin. The rural transport initiative has been under way since 2002 and is funded by the Department of Transport. Under the scheme, funding is provided for 34 rural community organisations to address the particular transport needs of their areas through the provision of local transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Area Development Management Limited manages the RTI on behalf of the Department of Transport. It has been fully responsible for administration of the initiative from the initial selection of the groups to be funded to the decisions regarding the specific annual allocations to individual projects. Expenditure under the RTI was some €6 million in the two year period ending December 2003. At that point the pilot initiative was due to end but further funding of €3 million was allocated to fund it for another year to facilitate a full appraisal. This appraisal was carried out earlier this year and on foot of one of its principal recommendations, the Minister for Transport recently extended the initiative for a further two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">A provisional allocation of €3 million for the RTI is contained in the 2005 Abridged Estimates Volume. Before the Estimates are finalised, the Minister hopes to be in a position to increase this provision to take account of expected increases in the operating costs of projects. This will result in an overall funding commitment of at least €12 million for the RTI to end 2005, which compares very favourably with the total of €4.4 million earmarked for the RTI in the National Development Plan 2000 — 2006. It should be borne in mind that RTI projects also benefit each year from funding provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs arising from the application of the free travel scheme to the initiative. In addition, some RTI projects are generating additional funds from the provision of transport services for health boards as well as from other sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">From the outset RTI projects have been encouraged to explore innovative ways in which their services can be partly financed from the local economy. The degree to which prospective RTI groups brought forward proposals for co-financing and additional resources to be secured from non-Exchequer sources was among the operational criteria used to assess the original applications for funding. The RTI is now operational in virtually every county with some 2,500 transport services being provided on approximately 380 new rural routes established under the initiative. Some 20,000 people are currently using the services every month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">In deciding on the extension of the RTI to end-2006 the Minister for Transport was conscious that many of the pilot projects only became fully operational in 2003. He was also conscious of the fact that continuing the initiative to end 2006 would ensure its lifespan would dovetail with the scope of the National Development Plan 2000 — 2006. The extension will facilitate a more comprehensive appraisal of the effectiveness of the pilot initiative in addressing the transport needs of rural areas. It will enable the 34 projects to further explore models of transport provision and strategically develop approaches to designing, planning, co-ordinating, integrating, procuring and providing transport in areas where it was traditionally considered difficult to do so. In providing additional time for the RTI projects to fully mature, the Minister is facilitating the emergence of models of best practice in the provision of rural transport services in terms of both operational and organisational management.</p>

            <p eId="para_1289">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 116, and 138 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy 1999 established a target to add 500 megawatts of new renewable energy based electricity generating plant to the electricity network by 2005. The initial implementation programme planned to support this target by allocating support contracts under AER V and VI of the alternative energy requirement, AER, support programme. The 500 MW had EU State aids clearance prior to the commencement of AER VI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The AER VI competition included an offshore wind category for the first time. It was decided following a study conducted by Byrne O'Cleirigh on behalf of Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, that support would be offered for two 25 megawatt demonstration projects. The cost of electricity produced from offshore plants supported by AER VI will impose a higher charge per unit on consumers than the onshore equivalent. Support was also proposed for up to 28 megawatts of biomass powered combined heat and power, CHP, plant. Both the offshore wind and biomass CHP categories were subject to State aids clearance from the EU Commission. State aids clearance does not exist for any further capacity in these categories and, therefore, I will not be offering any additional offshore wind contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">When the results of AER VI were announced in July of 2003, it was also indicated to the market that support would be offered for an additional 140 megawatts above the original 500 megawatts target again subject to State aids approval. My Department applied to the European Commission for the necessary approval at that time. However despite ongoing correspondence with the Commission it was not until August of this year that the additional capacity was cleared and not until September that my Department was notified of this clearance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">My Department's role in the AER support programme is to design and administer each AER round and to select the successful applicants. The associated formal contracts, in the form of power purchase agreements or PPAs, are issued by ESB customer service. However, ESB customer service will not be in a position to execute the PPAs until a related order under section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 is published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">It was not possible to progress a draft order to conclusion in advance of the Commission State aids decision and any special conditions which might arise. The draft order is now at an advanced stage of preparation and I will announce the allocations, by category and by applicants, of all remaining unallocated AER VI support very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">Each successful applicant in AER VI will have ongoing obligations to my Department to comply with the published terms and conditions of AER VI and to ESB customer service to comply with the terms and conditions of the formal contracts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1299">I am pleased to say that the Labour Relations Commission has facilitated an agreement between An Post and the Communications Workers Union on appropriate arrangements to deal with the Christmas post. It is good not only for An Post customers but also for the climate of industrial relations in the company that agreement has been reached because further complex and contentious industrial relations issues remain to be resolved in An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The critically important objective of restructuring the company remains an imperative. All parties have agreed that change in the company is necessary, if it is to be financially viable and well positioned to meet the competitive challenges, which can be expected to intensify during the months and years ahead. In this regard, an exhaustive process of negotiation between An Post and the Communications Workers Union has taken place, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission during 2004. While some progress has been made, there are still many points of disagreement between the company management and the union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The challenge going forward is for both sides to redouble their efforts to agree to put in place and to manage the changes necessary to enable An Post to thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Ultimately, it will be to the benefit of An Post and its employees, as well as its customers and the community at large, if agreement on much needed change can be secured. In such circumstances, An Post will be enabled to continue to deliver the kind of service, which is essential for a modern competitive economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1307">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 77, 113, 115 and 155 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">The Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable rural post office network as set out in the programme for Government. An expression of that commitment is the Government's approval of an equity injection of €12.7 million for An Post to facilitate the modernisation of post offices. The equity injection was paid to the company in 2003 and has helped drive the ongoing modernisation of the network. It may be useful, at this stage, to illustrate the current strength of the network in that there are 1,000 automated post offices, 475 non-automated post offices, 160 postal agencies and An Post has established 3,000 postpoint outlets in retail premises of which 600 can be used for bill payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">There is widespread recognition that the best strategy to sustain the network is for An Post to continue adapting to its customer needs within the financial constraints in which it now finds itself. The future of the post office network has been subject to a number of studies and reviews in recent years and many of the recommendations made have been implemented. The post office network at present has a high volume of people passing through the premises, a recognised brand name and a countrywide retail network. The priority for all stakeholders is to maintain and increase the amount of business being done through the network in order to secure its future. In addition, the post office network is geared to future opportunities with the majority of offices now computerised and already computerisation has brought benefits with increased technology-dependent financial business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">As part of the development strategy, An Post has secured additional business for the network, including bill pay facilities for the ESB, phone top-ups through their postpoint service and a contract with the AIB under which the bank's customers can access their accounts through the network. Further opportunities from both the public and private sectors are being actively explored by the company with a view to bringing on stream additional services at the post office counter, where possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">The main business developments in 2004 in relation to the post network include the collection of payments for Garda fines, Barclaycard credit card payments, Tele 2 bill payments and the sale of Dublin City Council commercial bin tags. In addition, a number of additional lines of new business are currently actively under discussion or consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">The post office enjoys a strong relationship with the sections of the population who are currently unbanked, including social welfare clients. With the rollout of eGovernment services, the post office network is ideally placed to capitalise on opportunities arising in this space, especially in the area of e-payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Parallel with these developments and under an agreement between the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post, the conversion of sub-post offices from a fixed contract to an agency basis, whereby payments are linked to transactions, is being implemented on a voluntary basis. The key requirement, that a service is provided locally, is being met by the new agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">The long-term future of the post office can only be secured by meeting the demands of customers. In this regard I have asked the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post to work in partnership with a view to securing existing business and to pursue new business opportunities as they arise. As outlined above, that strategy is being followed with some success by the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">The overarching objective going forward continues to be the retention of post offices services, in as many locations as possible, in the manner which best meets consumer needs whether services are provided via post offices, postal agencies or the postpoint network.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1317">The critically important objective of restructuring the company remains an imperative. All parties have agreed that change in the company is necessary, if it is to be financially viable and well positioned to meet the competitive challenges that can be expected to intensify during the months and years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">As outlined previously to the House, An Post management and the main union in An Post, the Communications Workers Union have been participating in exhaustive negotiations under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission aimed at reaching agreement on restructuring measures to address the company's financial situation. After seven months of negotiations, a set of proposals was produced. These included a 5.35% productivity increase over 30 months in return for substantial changes in work practices. It is my understanding that the CWU is currently balloting members on proposals which emerged from the negotiations. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on proposals currently under ballot.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">The challenge going forward is for both sides to redouble their efforts to agree to put in place and to manage the changes necessary to enable An Post to thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Ultimately, it will be to the benefit of An Post and its employees, as well as its customers and the community at large, if agreement on much needed change can be secured. In such circumstances, An Post will be enabled to continue to deliver the kind of service, which is essential for a modern competitive economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">With regard to the link between pay and pensions, it has been the practice of An Post and across the public sector to grant pension increases in line with pay increases to serving staff. I am informed that the terms and conditions, including those regarding the matter of increases, as enshrined in the An Post superannuation scheme 1990, are based on those that prevailed in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Notwithstanding this position, I have expressed my concern to the board and management of An Post about the situation in relation to pensioners. The board of An Post has now agreed to a proposal to pay a pension increase, subject to my approval and to that of the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for public service pensions. A response is awaited from the Department of Finance. When that response is received, my Department and the management of An Post will address the situation as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1324">I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 152 and 260 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">On 27 October last I met the chairman and chief executive officer of the ESB to discuss a range of issues including security of supply and the management of winter peak demand-supply balance. In summary, currently with some 5,563 mw of dispatchable capacity against an expected winter peak of 4,550 mw, the situation is tight but manageable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, monitors the security of electricity supply situation. Demand for electricity is currently forecast to grow at an annual rate of between 2.9% and 4.3% over the period 2004-10 necessitating additional generating capacity. The CER has initiated positive actions to redress postulated generation capacity shortfalls as forecast in the 2004-10 generation adequacy report by ESB national grid. Short-term measures put in place for this winter include the implementation by ESB National Grid of a demand side management programme, increased imports of 167 MW of electricity from Northern Ireland contracted on a priority basis and 208 MW of additional peaking capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">In response to the medium to long-term capacity deficit, two new independent plants successful in the CER's Capacity 2005 competition, generating up to 500 MW, are due to be commissioned by December 2005 and February 2006 and two new peat plants, with a combined capacity of 250 MW, are due to be commissioned by December 2004 and February 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">An ESB plant productivity programme is in place to enhance its availability from some 76% in 2003 to a target of 82% during 2004. To ensure that the programme delivers, the CER will impose penalties for failure to deliver on a progressive basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">The ESB is also currently undertaking a significant networks investment programme, of some €4 billion up to 2007. This is aimed at bringing the transmission and distribution systems up to required international standards and meeting projected capacity demand requirements. The programme is being delivered within the planned timeframe and budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Further increments of capacity will be required by 2007. In this connection, Viridian Group PLC has recently announced its plans to construct a second 400 MW gas fired power plant at Huntstown, County Dublin. In addition, the Government has given approval to proceed with the development of two 500 MW interconnectors between Ireland and Wales. When operational, these interconnectors will further enhance security of electricity supply, as well as increased interconnection North-South for which I gave the go-ahead last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Early next month, the transmission system operator, TSO, will publish the generation adequacy report for 2005-11, in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. This report assesses the likely minimum generation capacity required to achieve an adequate supply and demand balance for electricity over a seven year time horizon. The findings of this report will inform and augment policy developments in this area going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1335">MediaLab Europe, MLE, was formed by a series of tripartite agreements between the State, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, and MIT MediaLab and has been in operation since early 2000. It was established to conduct non-directed research in the field of digital media.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">While it is acknowledged that research will generally require State support, the uniqueness of the MLE model, as presented initially to Government, was that it would be self-funding by 2005. However, for a variety of reasons, including a downturn in the technology sector, MLE has consistently failed to meet its financial projections and the situation has deteriorated significantly over the past 24 months. At the current rate of expenditure, this should take MLE to the end of the first quarter 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">In view of these developments, the Government Liaison Committee, GLC, which brings together Departments with an interest in the MLE operation, wrote to MLE in February 2004 requesting that it undertake a fundamental review of its business model and produce a strategic plan. The board of MLE submitted its strategic plan to the Department on 7 May 2004 which included a request for additional Exchequer funding of €9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">Considering the importance of digital media in the broader ICT sector and the need for commitment to research and development in this field, there was a need to make a comprehensive assessment of the current model and structures at MLE. This having been done I am now considering possible options for the future of MLE.</p>

            <p eId="para_1340">A number of private sector broadband infrastructure projects were co-funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The ESB fibre wrap project consisted of the creation of a 1,300 kilometre optic fibre trunk network along the main electricity transmission grid, using the cables to carry the fibre. The network extends in two loops, the southern loop serving counties Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Wicklow, Dublin, Kildare, Laois, Offaly and Tipperary, while the northern loop passes through Clare, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath and also extends as far as Buncrana in County Donegal. The total eligible expenditure on the fibre wrap project was €45,913,609, and the grant paid was €14,878,582.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">Esat BT completed a number of projects under the previous National Development Plan 1994-1999, including the rollout of national and urban fibre networks and the construction of a high capacity digital corridor linking Dublin, Athlone, Galway and Shannon, serving 30 locations <i>en route</i>. Total investment in these projects amounted to €27,880,000 and grant funding was €9,229,973. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the company upgraded its digital link from Cork to Clonakilty and enabled 40 telephone exchanges for delivery of broadband by digital subscriber lines, DSL, at a total cost of €14,287,848. The grant paid was €4,109,114.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">The grant agreement with Eircom provided for upgrades to telephone exchanges for the provision of DSL services. Some 14 exchanges were enabled, at a total eligible expenditure of €3,694,502. The grant paid was €1,369,772. All of these projects were completed in 2003.</p>

            <p eId="para_1344">Broadband is the term used for a high speed always-on connection to the Internet, and is generally used to describe data speeds of at least ten times the rate available using the dial-up connection over standard telephone lines. Broadband can be delivered via a number of different technologies, including digital subscriber lines, DSL, coaxial cable, fibre optic cable, fixed wireless and satellite links. The broadband speeds available are lowest with DSL, while optic fibre offers virtually unlimited bandwidth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">There are now upwards of 105,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland. DSL is the most widely used broadband delivery system in Ireland, with over 83% of broadband customers using this technology. In areas where DSL cannot be delivered, for reasons of line quality or distance from the telephone exchange, other technologies, such as fixed wireless or satellite, offer subscribers a means of obtaining broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">The use of different technologies by the market is determined by local circumstances, geography, commercial criteria and customer needs. Up to early 2003 the market had been slow to invest in broadband infrastructure, and in response to the infrastructure deficit my Department put in place the regional broadband programme, under which an indicative €200 million of Government and ERDF funding is being invested in high speed high capacity fibre trunk networks that enable the provision of services by the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">The creation of high-capacity backbone infrastructure and metropolitan area networks, MANs, are the cornerstones of the programme. Nineteen MANs have now been completed, and seven more are under construction. In the next phase of the MANs programme broadband networks will be rolled out in over 90 towns of 1,500 population and more. The MANs are being managed for the State on an open-access basis, and offer private sector telecommunications providers access to services at bandwidths and prices on a par with the best available in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">The increasing availability of broadband can be seen from the fact that all telecommunications companies are now vigorously marketing broadband in all areas, using technologies such as DSL, satellite, wireless and cable. The number of broadband customers is growing by more than 30% per quarter, and has increased 80-fold in the past year. I am satisfied that the conditions are in place to see this rate of progress sustained through 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_1350">Iarnród Éireann, operating under the aegis of the Department of Transport, which is responsible for the management and operation of Rosslare Europort. Irish Continental Group plc announced on 20 October 2004 that it is restructuring, not ending or cutting back, the Ireland-France ferry service it operates through Irish Ferries. I also understand that the current Irish Ferries service to France will end not later than 30 November 2004 and that a new service will be introduced on 4 March 2005. It is normal practice for this service not to operate for a winter period. Accordingly, no adverse impact arises for Rosslare Europort from Irish Continental Group's current restructuring proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">I have met both with local public representatives and with union representatives to consider the company's announcement; I have also spoken with the company. Irish Continental Group alerted the Department in 2002 to its concerns that another shipping company planning to operate an Ireland-France ferry service may have received inappropriate State aid. My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, raised the matter with the European Commission, which investigated Irish Continental Group's complaint. I understand that its investigation did not lead to any further action being taken by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">I wrote to the then Commissioner Designate for Competition, and now Commissioner, Ms Neelie Kroes, in October 2004 seeking a meeting with her at an appropriate time to discuss ferry operations on the Ireland-France route.

            <p eId="para_1353">The availability of a ro-ro ferry service to France is a valuable element in our trade and tourism links with the Continent.

            <p eId="para_1355">There have been heavy losses in recent years at An Post's parcel delivery subsidiary, the special delivery service or SDS. These losses amounted to €18 million in a three year period to 2003, with losses of €12 million in 2003 alone. Further losses forecast at €10 million are likely to be sustained in 2004. In these circumstances, the board of An Post at its July meeting decided to close the SDS, and to reintegrate the parcels business into the letter post division. A total of 180 SDS jobs will be reintegrated into letter post and an entirely voluntary redundancy package will be introduced for an anticipated 270 job losses. The redundancy package will be funded by property disposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">It is my understanding that, following a request from the ICTU, the national implementation body held a hearing to determine whether the company breached the partnership terms of Sustaining Progress in making its decision to reintegrate SDS. The national implementation body, as part of its determination proposed that an independent facilitator be agreed to share the financial details and institute a process for information sharing. Mr. Peter Cassells has been appointed as facilitator and the process has been up and running for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">I stress that both An Post management and the Communications Workers Union have agreed that issues arising from the closure of SDS would be handled through the national implementation board process. Accordingly, I take this opportunity to urge both sides to make full use of the implementation board, which is a key pillar of social partnership, to address the financial issues of disagreement that have arisen between them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1359">Under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, the board of An Post is responsible for the appointment of the chief executive and oversight of the An Post management team. The current chief executive officer took up office in July 2003 and immediately commenced a review of An Post financials. The exercise indicated forecast losses of over €47 million in 2003 and the virtual exhaustion of cash reserves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">With company financials facing meltdown, a recovery strategy was immediately prepared and approved by the board of An Post. The strategy envisaged a substantial restructuring of the company, with over 1,700 voluntary redundancies and introduction of new work practices in return for pay increases. The recovery strategy was presented to the unions in December 2003 and difficult negotiations commenced on agreement and delivery of change. Eleven months later, proposals for restructuring were finalised under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and are currently being balloted on by the Communications Workers Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1361">The parcels division of An Post, SDS, has faced very difficult trading conditions in recent years. In the last five years, losses of over €30 million have been incurred. A restructuring plan for SDS was implemented in 2003. Unfortunately, this did not stem the losses and the board of An Post, based on the previous losses and the expected trading performance in 2004 together with the inability of SDS to compete in a very competitive parcels market, decided to close SDS and reintegrate the viable areas of the parcels business into letterpost thereby saving 170 jobs. On foot of a union request, the closure was referred to the National Implementation Body established under Sustaining Progress. Arising from that process, Mr. Peter Cassells was appointed as facilitator to resolve any issues arising from the closure process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">Since the appointment of the current chief executive by the board, the focus of the board and management along with the trade unions has been on the necessary restructuring of An Post so that the company can return to financial stability and continue to provide a good service while providing sustainable jobs for An Post employees. Rather than engage in any activity which would distract the board, management, unions and shareholder from the key objective to achieve company turnaround, the focus should continue to remain on implementing the necessary charges through the restructuring process. Considering the scale of the problems facing An Post, I believe that the interests of the company is best served by concentrating on the restructuring of the company in a spirit of partnership.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1364">The Government has consistently ruled out buyout as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and instead promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective. Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buyout nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">As a result, I have no plans to introduce proposals to purchase commercial salmon fishing licences. I would be prepared, however, to keep the matter under review and would be open to any relevant proposals whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch might fund in whole or in part any compensation arising.</p>

I am advised by the chairman that the commission is reviewing the operation of the wild salmon tagging scheme in 2004 and that he does not expect the commission to finalise its recommendations, including the proposed commercial catch quotas, for the operation of the scheme in 2005 until sometime in early January next. It is my intention to meet the National Salmon Commission and receive its advice at that time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1380">I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 117, 150 and 254 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">I have no function in setting of pricing for phone services. The regulation of telecommunications operators, including pricing, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications. ComReg has as one of its key objectives, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 the promotion of competition in the exercise of its functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile markets will drive down prices for consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecommunications policy, and my main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland by providing competitive services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">It is my belief that improving the market conditions to improve competition is the key way that we can drive down the mobile phone charges to the end user. The more competitive telecoms services that are on offer the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">In March 2004 my predecessor issued policy directions to ComReg, including a direction on competition. The direction on competition mandates ComReg to focus on competition as a key objective, with a particular focus on competition in the fixed and mobile markets, and to implement where necessary, remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players and to have particular regard to the following, market share of new entrants; ensuring that the applicable margin attributable to a product at the wholesale level is sufficient to promote and sustain competition; price level to the end user; and the potential of alternative technology delivery platforms to support competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">Another policy direction addressed national and cross-Border roaming. The ability to roam nationally on GSM networks would ensure that all three licensed GSM operators could provide countrywide coverage. Minimising cross-Border roaming costs on the island of Ireland would be beneficial for Irish mobile phone users, particularly those who live close to the Border. ComReg is obliged to examine using its powers to mandate national roaming on existing GSM networks of mobile network operators with significant market power on fair commercial terms; and work closely with operators and Ofcom, the regulator for Northern Ireland to encourage and support initiatives that would reduce or eliminate cross-Border roaming charges and encourage national call charging on an all-island basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">Recognising the importance of a single billing product to advancing competition in the fixed line telephone market, ComReg was also directed to introduce a wholesale line rental product for voice and data services, that was accessible, affordable and with sufficient margin for telecommunications operators to enable them to stimulate and drive competition in this market by 31 March 2004. This product has been introduced and ComReg's most recent report on the policy directions indicates that initial take up of this product has been successful with over 30,000 customers having taken up this product since its launch.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">It is true that post-pay mobile phone costs in Ireland remain higher than the EU average but it is also true that in August 2004 the OECD found we had the fourth lowest costs for pre-paid mobile phones. It is important in considering the price competitiveness to the end user to make a judgment across telecommunications services. Furthermore, the current penetration rate of mobile phones of around 90% indicates that Irish business and consumers have a range of products and pricing options which broadly meet their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">I also welcome the fact that in July of this year Meteor reached agreement with O2 that allows meteor national roaming on O2's network. This should facilitate greater choice and competition for the consumer, and next year we will have more competition with the launch of new entrant "3s"— 3G services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">With regard to fixed line pricing, ComReg, in its last quarterly market update, indicates that total end-user pricing for both the residential and business sectors in Ireland remains competitive. In terms of the business community, prices for the standard basket put us in sixth place in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">In the residential market Ireland is placed in ninth position. In terms of international calls we are in fourth and sixth place, respectively. This finding is supported by similar benchmarking research by the OECD in relation to international calls which found that Irish international call tariffs to be significantly below the average particularly for off-peak calls. Analysis in the National Competitive Council's report on telecommunications indicates that overall prices have fallen in the past five years by over 9% and these reductions have contributed to a 1% overall reduction in inflation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1392">Independent regulation of the electricity and natural gas industries has been established in Ireland in line with EU requirements. The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, was initially established in July 1999 by virtue of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to underpin an open, transparent and accountable regulatory process for the electricity industry. The commission's jurisdiction was expanded in 2002 following the passing of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002 to incorporate the regulation of the natural gas industry. It has an overriding duty to carry out its statutory functions and exercise its powers in a manner that does not discriminate unfairly and which protects the interests of final customers and not just industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">The CER's mission is to promote electricity and gas markets that deliver choice, high quality and competitively priced electricity and gas to consumers on a safe, secure and sustainable basis. The CER adheres to due process in arriving at its decisions and engages in a wide-ranging consultation process on all aspects of the future direction of the electricity and gas industries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">In the electricity market, the CER facilitates competition by authorising the construction of new generating plant and licensing companies to generate and supply electricity. Similarly, in the gas sector, the CER issues consents for the construction of pipelines and licenses gas suppliers. The CER takes an active regulatory stance in relation to the operation, maintenance and development of the electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks, as well as approving tariffs for third party access to these systems. The CER also has the key responsibility of regulating prices charged to customers by ESB and BGÉ.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Under the regulatory oversight of the CER, Ireland is moving from a <i>de facto</i> monopoly situation to a competitive market in industries with relatively long lead times for investment. Therefore, changes need to be conceived and effected in an orderly and measured manner so as to ensure that the benefits are sustainable in the long term. The incremental approach to full liberalisation of these markets in 2005 adopted by Ireland is the correct policy choice, given that our systems are small by comparison with our EU partners and not as heavily interconnected. The CER already has a wide-ranging remit and I am providing, in regulations, for the extension of its functions so as to meet the requirements of the second EU electricity and gas directives, further facilitating market liberalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">The Deputy will also be aware that I am strengthening the CER by expanding its membership to a preferred three-person model, having regard to the importance of the energy sector in terms of competitiveness of the Irish economy. In addition, I consider it opportune that, in the interests of proper and effective regulation of the electricity and gas markets, the Minister may issue policy directions of a general nature to the CER. As it stands, I have certain limited statutory powers to give directions to the CER in relation to electricity trading arrangements. While I am proposing additional powers to issue policy directions in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, it would be my intention to use any such powers sparingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1398">There are a number of digital television transmission networks available. The most common networks available internationally are digital terrestrial, cable-MMDS and satellite networks.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1404">I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 91 and 123 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">It would be useful if I outline briefly the market environment in which postal business is conducted. The postal market has changed significantly in recent years with liberalisation of the European postal market and with postal operators moving from national into international markets. This has impacted on this country with partial liberalisation of the postal market on foot of EU directives and with the presence of a number of international operators in the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">The parcels market in Ireland is now fully liberalised and operators are providing high quality services. The market includes some of the biggest postal operators in the world providing international reach to Irish business. Our strong economic fundamentals and multinational presence make Ireland attractive for the big logistics firms. The competitive nature of the market with a substantial number of local and international operators provides a range of services which largely meet consumer and business needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">The letters market has been partially liberalised, with outbound international mail fully liberalised since the beginning of 2004. Further EU driven liberalisation proposals are likely to come on stream in the years ahead and strong international players, currently operating in the parcels sector, are likely to look for opportunities in the letter post area. Furthermore, mail is facing a strong challenge from electronic substitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">It is essential that An Post now capitalise on its assets, one of which is their nationwide delivery network for letters and parcels. The volume of letterpost per person in Ireland is below the EU average. This shows that there is definite room for growth in the sector especially in niche areas of marketing and direct mail.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">The key fundamental for An Post to ensure viability is the need to return the company to financial stability. In this regard, the management and unions of An Post have been engaged in an intensive negotiating process, with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery, in order to reach agreement on necessary restructuring measures for sorting and mail delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">The post office network has been the subject of a number of studies and reviews in recent years, many of the recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented, with particular regard to winning new business, including extra banking business and new utility business. The post office network, at present, has a high footfall, a recognised brand name and a countrywide retail network. Clearly, there is scope to build on the range of services already provided and to obtain new business for the network building on existing strengths. The network is geared towards the future with the majority of offices now computerised and computerisation has brought benefits with new banking business obtained from AIB and extra utility business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">The post office enjoys a strong relationship with the sections of the population who are currently unbanked, including social welfare clients. With the roll-out of e-government services, the post office network is ideally placed to capitalise on opportunities arising in this space, especially in the area of e-payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">In the development of any new service, the key focus for An Post will be to offer a range of quality products and services which meet consumer demands. An Post's future will only be guaranteed by adapting to the increasingly competitive environment in which it operates.</p>

            <p eId="para_1414">I have no function in the matter raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">The Irish Cellular Industry Association, ICIA, which represents the country's mobile phone operators and manufacturers, announced a trial of content filtering software for mobile networks in June 2004. As this is a trial by a group of private operators in a fully liberalised market, it would not be appropriate for me as Minister to comment on whether it may or may not be successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">In the context of discussions regarding the feasibility of introducing a registration system for the use of pre-paid mobile phones, which I hope to introduce, the ICIA has briefed officials in my Department on the progress of the trials. I am informed that these trials are the world's first ever industry mobile content filtering trial and will test the filtering capability of software for mobile camera phone images, offensive websites and video. The ICIA believes this technological solution will successfully counteract the transmission of offensive images and will prove an effective deterrent. It is anticipated that test results will be available early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">Legislation is already in place to prosecute the issue of nuisance and criminal calls, and the sending of pornographic images by mobile phones. Any additional mechanism that may help protect minors from the transmission of pornographic images by mobile phone is to be welcomed and I look forward to receiving an update on the trial results from the industry.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1420">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 149 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">On 15 November last, I met with the executive of the Irish Postmasters Union who represent postmasters and postmistresses who are responsible for the running of the sub-post office network on a contract basis. I outlined to them my commitment, and that of the Government, to the retention of a viable and sustainable post office network meeting the needs of consumers with attractive products and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">I listened with interest to their views and proposals in regard to the development of the network. Areas discussed included financial issues affecting rural post offices, as well as computerisation and business development for post offices. I was pleased to hear that that they are keen to enhance the range of products and services available through the network. For my part, I encouraged the union to work closely with An Post to continue the development process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">The primary responsibility for the development of the post office network remains with An Post, and while the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment, in a tangible fashion, with a €12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for all stakeholders, including the IPU, to continue to work with An Post in enhancing existing services and to build on existing strengths to develop new product offerings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">The Communications Workers Union has also requested a meeting with me. As shareholder of An Post, I have no difficulty in meeting any trade union in the company. However, I am obliged to be mindful of the industrial relations situation in the company and the fact that the CWU is balloting on proposals for company restructuring.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">The proposals on restructuring came about as a result of negotiations which stretched over seven months under the auspices of the LRC. The length of the negotiation process indicates the difficult and deep-seated issues to be resolved within An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">The restoration of financial and operational stability can only be achieved by management and unions adopting a partnership approach, using the services of the State's industrial relations machinery. Unfortunately, there is no magic wand that I can wave which will provide an easy solution to the difficulties in An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The CWU has indicated that as part of any discussions, it is anxious to discuss the SDS situation with me and has forwarded a report prepared by a firm of accountants on the financial situation in SDS. Following the decision by the An Post board to close SDS and reintegrate the viable elements of the business into Letterpost, the CWU referred the closure decision to the National Implementation Body.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Arising from that process, Mr. Peter Cassells was appointed to facilitate any issues arising out of the closure. Both union and management agreed that closure issues would be handled within the ambit of the NIB brokered process. Therefore, any issues arising should be resolved using that framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">Clearly, it would not be appropriate for me to have any perceived impact on the conduct of industrial resolutions processes and, therefore, it would not be appropriate, at this time, for me to meet the CWU to discuss matters which are the subject of ongoing IR processes with the company. I understand that the members of the CWU have voted to renew a mandate for strike action. Rather than resorting to any form of industrial action, I urge the members of the union to work through the established industrial relations machinery to resolve areas of disagreement between management and unions. An Post customers are entitled to a postal service, especially at Christmas and I would urge no disruption of postal deliveries at this time of the year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1431">It is estimated that the final net return to the Exchequer arising from the sale of the business and commercial assets of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, will be in excess of €30 million. The INPC has paid €20 million to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">In November 2003, the board of the INPC, cognisant of its obligations under the Companies Acts to retain sufficient assets to meet potential liabilities, determined that it would not be appropriate to make a further payment to the Exchequer at that stage as a number of outstanding matters have still to be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">These ongoing matters, comprising of environmental claims lodged against the INPC and a contractual dispute with a former customer, have potential financial implications and, consequently, the INPC is not currently in a position to divest itself of its remaining financial assets. As the claims and the dispute are day-to-day matters for the INPC, it is not appropriate for me to elaborate further on them. However, they are being robustly defended by the INPC, with the benefit of expert legal and technical advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">Given the involvement of third parties in the unresolved matters, neither the INPC nor my Department is in a position to indicate when the remaining proceeds may become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">It has always been accepted that the total cash return to the Exchequer arising from the INPC transaction would be considerably less than the headline sale price of US$100 million as the INPC had, for example, to use some of the proceeds to discharge the company's debt. Contrary to the impression that appears still to persevere, the purchaser of the facilities paid over the full amount due to the INPC in July 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">I am satisfied that the transaction represented a very positive outcome for the State, particularly having regard to the fact that the Government also placed an obligation on the private owners to operate the facilities for a period of at least 15 years as a condition of the sale.</p>

            <p eId="para_1440">The Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003 provides for the establishment of a fund to support certain television and radio productions and projects out of an amount of 5% of net receipts of television licence fees and in accordance with a scheme to be administered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The Act provides that 5% of the net proceeds from television licence fees be paid into the fund with effect from 1 January 2003. To date a total of €16.02 million has been paid into the fund. As a scheme to administer grants from the fund is not yet in place the BCI has issued no payments to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">The legislation provides for the establishment of a scheme or schemes to provide funding in respect of new television or radio programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, improvements to adult literacy and the development of archiving of programme material produced in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">The BCI has completed a public consultation on a draft scheme on the operation of the fund.

            <p eId="para_1445">I understand that the Deputy is referring to P &amp; O Irish Sea Ferries announcement that in December 2004 it will end its ferry service between Rosslare and Cherbourg. TheP &amp; O service is provided by their ship, the <i>European Diplomat</i>, and cater, <i>inter alia</i>, for live cattle exports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">I have met my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to consider the implications of the P &amp; O announcement. The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, the State's development agency for the shipping and shipping services sector, which reports to me, has been tasked with seeking to facilitate the provision of a similar service. With representatives of the livestock haulage sector and farmers representatives, the IMDO has been in contact with port and shipping sector interests in the above regard.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1450">I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 119 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">The newspaper article of 31 October last, to which the Deputy refers, contends, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Government offered Eircom a €1.8 billion deal to roll out broadband nationally. It also contends that Eircom was offered a range of incentives such as tax breaks, subsidised loans, amendments to the building regulations and price increases as carrots. These claims are untrue. At no stage were negotiations entered into with Eircom or any other party. At no stage were terms such as postulated in the newspaper article on offer, nor did the Government offer to fund Eircom directly or indirectly through subsidised loans, tax breaks or any other means. Consultancy advice contained in a report to a Government subcommittee, agency or a Department should not be misconstrued as Government policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">The telecommunications market is a regulated market and, thus, any action by Government has to be consonant with national and EU regulation. Accordingly, Government is not in the business of entering exclusive contracts of the kind inferred by the article with any market entities. It favours investment in open access infrastructure to which all operators have access on similar transparent terms. That is the ethos behind the Government's open-access metropolitan area network programme, which is rolling out high-speed broadband infrastructure to 120 towns and cities regionally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">To the extent that discussions are held between officials of my Department and executives of other telecommunications operators and their representative associations, these were and are born of sound public policy practice and in the context of seeking to align as much as possible the broadband rollout plans of corporate entities and those of the Government, as published in New Connections and the Government's broadband plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">In that context I commend the telecommunications operators who have contributed significantly to the 80-fold increase in broadband consumers in Ireland in the last 15 months.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
        the procedures in place to record the direct landing of fish stocks caught on Irish registered vessels in British and Norwegian ports; and the figures for the landings of mackerel in this regard over the past five years in both these countries.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1456">The rules governing landings by EU fishing vessels fishing for mackerel, horse mackerel — northern stock — and herring — northern stocks — are set down in Annex IV of Council Regulation 2287/2003. These rules apply to landings into all member states and require that in respect of all landings greater than ten tonnes: the master of a fishing vessel to give four hours advance notice of landing, including specified details of the catch, to the competent authorities of the member state into which the landing is to take place, the member state designates ports for landings these species; the competent authorities of the member state concerned shall require that the discharge does not commence until authorised to do so; the master of a fishing vessel must submit immediately upon arrival to port the relevant pages of the logbook; and the fish must be weighed by the buyers before being sorted, processed, transported etc. in the presence of a controller.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">As part of the EU-Norway fisheries agreement, similar provisions are in place in respect of landings of these pelagic species by Irish and other vessels into Norway. Under the provisions governing the logbook, a copy of the logsheet and landing declaration must be sent to the Irish authorities within 48 hours of landing. This applies to landings into Irish, EU and Norwegian ports. The Irish authorities report on landings to the European Commission in respect of landings into Irish ports and into non-member ports, including Norway. Landings into other member states' ports are reported by the member state concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">Landings of stocks by Irish vessels into non-Irish ports are subject to any additional rules that may apply at national level in the relevant country. The figures for the landings of mackerel over the past five years in the countries specified are outlined in the table below.</p>

            <p eId="para_1489">The promotion of renewable energy technologies is a key priority of the Government. The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy 1999 established a target to add 500 megawatts of new renewable energy based electricity generating plant to the electricity network by 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">Further proposals in the course of the most recent support programme, AER VI, are being implemented to support the construction of an additional 140 MWs generally, an additional 50 MWs in an offshore wind category and an additional 28 MWs specific to biomass powered CHP plants. This represents an increase of more than 40% on the original target and is itself evidence of the growing importance this Government places on renewable energy technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">AER VI brings to a close an initial programme to add renewable energy technologies to the electricity network at a level which does not raise serious technical issues. However, planning for future programmes at increased penetration levels does raise significant technical issues which must be addressed in order to maintain system security for electricity customers. This plan may in turn require a revision of the current support programme to embrace changes required to allow higher levels of wind energy penetration in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">At the end of last year a consultation document Options for Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets and Programmes was published. The consultation document and supporting annexes which examine in detail support mechanisms and renewable energy policies in Ireland as well as in other European countries, were published on my Department's website and looked at key challenges in the future including policy, future green energy markets, how to overcome barriers to the deployment of renewable energy and future options for market support mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">In May of this year a renewable energy development group, chaired by my Department, was established. The group comprises relevant experts from the administrative and scientific sector. This group will advise on future options on policies, targets, programmes and support measures to develop the increased use of renewable energy in the electricity market to 2010 and beyond. This group's report which is due before the end of this year will form the basis of my future policy proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">The AER programme is primarily about supporting renewable energy in the electricity market. Biofuels are also renewable fuels which can be used as alternatives for fossil fuels in vehicles. Earlier this year, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which allows the Minister for Finance to apply a relief from mineral oil tax for biofuels essential to a pilot project to produce biofuel or to research aspects of biofuel production and usage as a motor fuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">My Department is finalising details of the scheme with the Department of Finance. The European Commission has confirmed that the scheme would represent a State aid and, consequently, its approval is required. The EU energy tax directive 2003 envisages such tax relief and the Commission has approved schemes for excise relief of biofuel in other EU member states. Formal application for Commission approval will be made shortly by the Department of Finance and, assuming approval is granted, the necessary commencement order will then be signed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">In tandem with these programmes, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI the independent non-commercial State body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy including deployment of renewable energy sources, has commenced a challenging work programme to increase energy efficiency and to promote renewable energy technologies. In the renewable energy field specifically SEI has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology RD &amp; D.</p>

            <p eId="para_1506">I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 144 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">There are 37 onshore and one offshore wind projects constructed with a capacity of over 240 MW. These renewable energy based electricity plants have been supported, in the main, under the Department's alternative energy requirement, AER, programme. Other projects have been built with assistance from European Community programmes and under the liberalised electricity market for renewables.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">New wind energy projects, representing approximately 200 MW, are under construction. These are located in counties Carlow, Cavan, Cork, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim and Wexford. Further projects are due to commence construction under the terms and conditions of the AER V and AER VI competitions. Wind energy projects may also be planned, or under construction, under the liberalised green electricity market, however, I have no details of these projects as they operate outside of the programmes run by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">The promotion of renewable energy, of which wind energy is the predominant technology, is a key priority of the Government. The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy 1999 established a target to add 500 megawatts of new renewable energy based electricity generating plant to the electricity network by 2005. This target has since increased to 718 MWs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">The wind resource is random and cannot increase or decrease the electricity generated in immediate response to consumer demand. The current support target for wind powered projects does not raise serious technical issues for system stability. However, planning for future programmes at increased penetration levels of wind powered electricity generating plant does raise significant technical issues which must be addressed in order to maintain system security for electricity consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">The Commission for Energy Regulation, which is independent in the discharge of its functions, is currently examining issues of immediate relevance regarding the grid code for wind powered generators. In addition, in May of this year a renewable energy development group, chaired by my Department, was established. The group which includes Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, participation will advise on future options on policies, targets, programmes and support measures to develop the increased use of renewable energy in the electricity market to 2010 and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">A major portion of the group's current work is to resolve the challenges arising from future increased connection of intermittent wind powered generating capacity to the electricity network. This group's report which is due before the end of this year will form the basis of my future policy proposals to further increase the penetration of renewable energy sources to electricity production.</p>

The Act provided that 5% of the net proceeds from television licence fees would be paid into the fund with effect from 1 January 2003. To date a total of €16.02 million has been paid into the fund.

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_501">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1518">The Irish national seabed survey is a major €32 million initiative by the Government which demonstrates its commitment to the marine and geoscience sectors. Announced in 1999, it will have surveyed close to 500,000 square kilometres of Ireland's offshore territory by the time the current funding ceases at the end of 2005. The extension of the programme beyond 2005 will be clarified in the context of a strategic review which is currently under way. When this review is completed, I will consider its contents and address the future of the seabed survey beyond 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">Ireland is fortunate in having a seabed area that is approximately ten times its land area. Prior to the start of the Irish national seabed survey, we had no systematic information on this highly valuable national resource. As a result of this initiative, all of the deep-water region and much of the shallow coastal survey will be completed by the end of 2005. The survey is managed by the Geological Survey of Ireland, a division of my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and additional strategic partners. The deep water surveys were contracted to the private sector while most of those in shallow water have been undertaken by the vessels of the Marine Institute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">The focus of the work has shifted gradually from data collection to the creation of value-added products of national significance. For example, products designed for the fisheries sector will facilitate efficient and environmentally-friendly operations. The results will inform policy development and decision-making at national and European levels in areas such as fisheries, environmental protection and maritime safety. At the same time, the programme supported the upgrading of the national skills base with over 1,000 persons involved in varied capacities, and it has strengthened Ireland's profile in seabed mapping internationally. Through co-operation with the third level sector, the programme has also supported research in the marine and geoscience sectors which will be of international significance. The challenging quantities of data acquired are stored in a state of the art data management system at the Geological Survey of Ireland, backed up by a data storage and delivery system maintained by NUI Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">It is recognised that additional work remains to be completed in the coastal and shallow seas beyond 2005. These areas are of critical importance to sectors such as shipping, fisheries, heritage and leisure, and will be considered in the course of the ongoing strategic review. I am pleased to acknowledge the success of this major undertaking, which I realise is widely regarded as a considerable achievement and of significant benefit to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">The programme was not designed to examine hydrocarbon reserves and has no direct impact on their extent. However, the techniques used may lead to greater understanding of the offshore setting of hydrocarbons.</p>

            <p eId="para_1526">The feasibility of deploying emergency towing vessels, ETVs, in Irish waters is under consideration in the Department. In 1998 the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of deploying ETVs around the coast. Following an assessment of the study, which was published in 1999, it was decided that: Ireland should have access to ETV capacity to protect the coast from the consequences of major oil pollution and vessel stranding; the Department would consult the Departments of Finance, Defence and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on cost effectiveness, location, financing, operational aspects, possible other uses, etc.; and Ireland and the UK would consult on the possible sharing of an ETV to cover the east coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">The Department set up an internal working group to manage the consultation process referred to above and to progress the matter generally. The likely very significant costs associated with the provision of ETV capability and complex operational requirements were recognised. The working group concluded that: an ETV capacity should be provided to service the west coast via a public private partnership process, PPP; and an ETV for the east coast should be provided to ensure an acceptable level of cover at minimum cost, including, if possible, on a joint PPP approach with the UK for the Irish Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">The Department is examining how these proposals can be pursued, having regard in particular to the very significant costs involved.</p>

The domestic conservation measures for sea bass are kept under review on an annual basis, in light of scientific assessments by the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute of the State of sea bass stocks as well as assessments of the impact of commercial fishing effort on sea bass stocks by other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">This year, following a review of the scientific assessments relating to sea bass, it was decided that the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Order should be renewed for a further year. The effect of this order is to prohibit the sale or offer for sale of bass, other than bass which has been imported into the State, from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The bass fishing conservation by-law which imposes a bag limit on anglers of two bass in any one period of 24 hours and provides for a ban on angling for bass during the spawning season was also renewed this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1536">The question relates to advances made by the State to the company between 1983 and 1986 totalling £956,296 for the purposes of securing the continuation of interest payments by the company on senior financing. The figure of €44 million includes interest at 20%. This was set at an equivalent rate to that claimed on advances to the company by other directors, which have also not been paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">The advances were made by the State to tide the company over during negotiations on rescue packages and to forestall the execution of judgments already obtained by the banks. Attempts to rescue the company failed and a receiver was appointed by the High Court in 1985. The receivership was stalled pending the outcome of a number of court actions, including the High Court case brought by directors of the company against Tara Mines and others and the State — Record Number 1986 No. 10898P — which were not ultimately settled until December 2000 when the High Court set aside all pending actions by Bula against the receiver and consented to the sale of the assets of the company. In May 2001 the receiver announced that he had reached agreement on the sale of the assets of Bula for a total of €34.9 million, £27.5 million. The sale of this asset was not sufficient to repay all the moneys outstanding to the banks. The nature of the advances by the State to the company were such that they were subordinated to the senior debt so there was no possibility of them being repaid once the receivership was in train.</p>

            <p eId="para_1553">The Department's coast protection programme seeks to address the most urgent instances of erosion on the Irish coastline. Coastal erosion affects all coastal counties and is particularly prevalent on the softer coastline in the east and south-east of the country. The rise in sea levels associated with global warming is projected to lead to an increase in coastal erosion, because of rising mean water levels and expected increases in storm frequency and wave heights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">A value for money report in March 2002 highlighted the need for a more strategic focus in addressing the problem of coastal erosion in Ireland. In this respect the coastal protection strategy study commenced in 2003. The study will address the nature and extent of erosion at various locations and different types of coastline in Ireland and seek to identify the most effective means, technically, financially and environmentally, in responding to particular instances and types of erosion. It is expected that when this study is completed a more targeted approach to programme delivery will enable a greater level of efficiency to be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">Under the coast protection measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, €52.01 million is identified for expenditure. Expenditure under this measure up to the end of 2003 was €29.1 million. Funding of €2.7 million is allocated to my Department for the coastal protection programme in 2004. Funding of €30,000 was allocated to Wicklow County Council in 2004 to undertake a study at Brittas Bay and a further €52,500 was allocated for a site investigation at Greystones.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">This judgment of the European Court of Justice relates to a number of cases of Irish fish quotas being exceeded in 1995 and 1996. The details of the judgment are being examined in detail by the Department. In the light of this judgment, the European Commission has asked Ireland to indicate by 22 January 2005 details of the measures that have been taken or will be taken to address the issues raised by the judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">I wish to confirm to the Deputy that the Department will urgently complete its examination of this matter and that a detailed response will issue to the Commission within the January 2005 deadline. The Department's response will focus in particular on the range of additional fisheries control measures that have been developed and implemented since the mid-1990s to address the system deficiencies that arose from the over-fishing cases in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">I wish to stress the great importance which Ireland attaches to compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.

            <p eId="para_1567">Since taking up office, I have met the chairperson and the chief executive of An Post on one occasion in October. Departmental officials meet with An Post management on a monthly basis to be updated on significant issues. I am advised on the outcome of the monthly meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">With regard to continuity of services, I am pleased to say that the Labour Relations Commission has facilitated an agreement between An Post and the Communications Workers' Union on appropriate arrangements to deal with the Christmas post. It is good not only for An Post customers but also for the climate of industrial relations in the company that agreement has been reached because further complex and contentious industrial relations issues remain to be resolved in An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">The critically important objective of restructuring the company remains an imperative. All parties have agreed that change in the company is necessary, if it is to be financially viable and well positioned to meet the competitive challenges that can be expected to intensify during the months and years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">In this regard, an exhaustive process of negotiation between An Post and the Communications Workers' Union has taken place, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission during 2004. The union is now balloting on the outcome of these negotiations. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">I also understand that the members of the CWU have voted to renew a mandate for strike action. Rather than resorting to any form of industrial action, I would urge the members of the union to work through the established industrial relations machinery to resolve areas of disagreement between management and unions. An Post customers are entitled to a postal service, especially at Christmas and I would urge no disruption of postal deliveries at this time of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">The proper forum for discussing industrial relations issues is the State's industrial relations machinery. I am of the view that while all parties continue to engage with these mechanisms, that progress can continue to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">The challenge going forward is for both sides to redouble their efforts to agree to put in place and to manage the changes necessary to enable An Post to thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Ultimately, it will be to the benefit of An Post and its employees, as well as its customers and the community at large, if agreement on much needed change can be secured. In such circumstances, An Post will be enabled to continue to deliver the kind of service which is essential for a modern competitive economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1581">My Department is responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy including biofuels and I am committed to the development of an integrated strategy to increase market penetration of biofuels in Ireland. An interdepartmental group has been set up, chaired by my Department and comprising officials from Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the Departments of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport, Agriculture and Food and Finance, and it is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland with a view to increasing the penetration of biofuels in the transport fuel market. A liquid biofuels strategy study has also been commissioned by SEI to examine the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland. The report will include options for the production of bioethanol, biodiesel and pure plant oil and will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">Discussions have taken place between SEI and the sugar producing industry to explore the potential for bioethanol production. Meetings have also been held with other organisations who are looking at the production of bioethanol from feedstocks other than sugar beet and with organisations interested in the production of biodiesel and pure plant oil. I understand from SEI that these contacts are continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">SEI's research development and demonstration programme offers capital grant aid for biofuels market demonstration projects in several categories including bioethanol, biodiesel and pure plant oil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">In March 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels. The purpose of the scheme is to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise of biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">My Department has finalised details of the scheme with the Department of Finance. The European Commission has confirmed that the scheme would represent a state aid and, consequently, its approval is required. In this regard the Department of Finance has recently written to the Commission seeking approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">From May 2003 to May 2004 18,000 litres of rapeseed oil was sold and used as fuel in Ireland. The European Commission Green Paper, towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply, sets an objective of 20% substitution of conventional fuels by alternative fuels in the road transport sector by the year 2020. The EU Biofuels Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport sets indicative targets for market penetration of biofuels to 2010 and my Department's focus at this point, is to promote the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland, in accordance with the directive. A report has been prepared for submission to the Commission and will be made publicly available shortly.</p>

In that debate I expressed support for the objectives set down in the EFF proposal, particularly those relating to support for stock recovery plans and the sustainable management of fisheries, support for the economic development of coastal areas and also aquaculture development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">In respect of the sustainable development of inshore fisheries, the proposed fund makes specific provision for measures to assist small-scale coastal fishing and the areas dependent on them.

            <p eId="para_1595">In relation to pollution-salvage operations, IRCG agreed with the UK authorities, who acted for the Canadian Government, plans and procedures for salvage of the submarine. The towing vessel used in the salvage operations was brought from the north east of Scotland. However, while very poor weather conditions and very rough seas resulted in slower than usual arrival of the towing vessel at the scene of the incident and difficulty in securing of towing equipment to the submarine, salvage was successfully carried out and no pollution resulted from the incident.</p>

            <p eId="para_1597">I can assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the widespread concerns being expressed, not just by anglers, about the viability of salmon fishing in Ireland. We are all agreed that over-exploitation of fish stocks is a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of the inland fisheries resource. Since publication of the salmon management task force report in 1996, the Department has introduced a range of conservation measures which have seen considerable advancements made in salmon policy and in particular the management of the commercial salmon fishery. As part of these measures, the drift net season is now confined to a two-month period in June and July on a four-day week basis. Fishing is only allowed during daylight hours and is confined to the area within the six-mile limit. The Department operates, through the regional fisheries boards, the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations, which <i>inter alia</i> limit the total allowable commercial catch of salmon TAC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">Earlier this year, on the advice of the national salmon commission and the National Fisheries Management Executive, my predecessor further reduced the total allowable commercial catch by 11%. This was consistent with the salmon commission's three-year strategy aimed at reaching the scientific advice on precautionary catch limits over the period 2003-2005. I await the advice of these bodies, based on their analysis including the 2004 season, on the conservation measures, including TAC, to be adopted in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">It is the Government's belief that the current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice holds out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long-term sustainable fishery for both sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">For this reason, the Government has consistently ruled out buyout as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and instead promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective. Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buyout nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">As a result, I have no plans to introduce proposals to purchase commercial salmon fishing licences. I would be prepared, however, to keep the matter under review and would be open to any relevant proposals whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch might fund in whole or in part any compensation arising.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1606">I am aware of the incident which occurred near Rosslare Harbour on 30 January 2003 in which a ro-ro passenger ferry, lost engine power 30 minutes after leaving port for Fishguard in Wales and drifted towards Tuskar Rock lighthouse. The emergency services were immediately alerted in this case and preparations put in hand to render assistance to the vessel. However, after some one and a half hours the vessel regained full engine power and was able to continue its journey without further incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">The feasibility of deploying emergency towing vessels, ETVs, in Irish waters is under consideration in the Department. In 1998 the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of deploying ETVs around the coast. Following an assessment of the study, which was published in 1999, it was decided that Ireland should have access to ETV capacity to protect the coast from the consequences of major oil pollution and vessel stranding; the Department would consult with the Departments of Finance, Defence and Environment, Heritage and Local Government on cost effectiveness, location, financing, operational aspects, possible other uses, etc; and Ireland and the UK would consult on the possible sharing of an ETV to cover the east coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">The Department set up an internal working group to manage the consultation process referred to above and to progress the matter generally. The likely very significant costs associated with the provision of ETV capability and complex operational requirements were recognised. The working group concluded that an ETV capacity should be provided to service the west coast via a public private partnership process, PPP, and an ETV for the east coast should be provided to ensure an acceptable level of cover at minimum cost, including, if possible, on a joint PPP approach with the UK for the Irish Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">The Department is examining how the working group's conclusions can be pursued having regard to the very high costs associated with the provision and operation of such a vessel.</p>

            <p eId="para_1617">The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, was requested by my predecessor to assess, in the first instance, the degree of interest in developing merchant interconnection. It reported last June that there was insufficient interest on the part of the private sector to construct "pure" merchant interconnectors without financial underpinning of any form. However, the CER's overall impression from the submissions it had received from interested parties was that there was a genuine interest on the part of several key industry players in developing east-west interconnection on the basis of hybrid merchant-regulated type interconnection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">Accordingly, the CER has been requested to develop proposals to activate a process exploring all possible options for the development of the two 500 MW electricity interconnectors on a hybrid-regulated basis. The CER is engaging external professional advice to assist it in framing a competitive type process to deliver the interconnection at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">Turning to the second part of the Deputy's question, under the provisions of the EU Electricity Directive 2003-54-EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96-92-EC, to avoid imbalance in the opening of electricity markets, the supply of electricity to customers deemed eligible in other member states shall not be prohibited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">Also, it is not possible to prohibit electricity generated from nuclear sources being imported over the proposed east-west interconnectors, since it is not physically possible to prevent the flow of nuclear generated electricity onto the network. This is the case with the existing interconnection between Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland through the Moyle interconnector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">The Deputy may wish to note that with the implementation of the above mentioned electricity directive, shortly, all electricity suppliers will be required to specify in or with the electricity bills and in promotional material made available to final customers, the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year. I am confident, given the known popular opposition to nuclear energy in Ireland, that suppliers would not knowingly contract for electricity imports clearly traceable to nuclear stations or that Irish consumers would knowingly buy any. There is simply no business case for selling nuclear energy in Ireland.</p>

In light of this, we propose to draft a scheme to ensure a higher standard and a better availability of our services through Irish. My Department is among the first of the public bodies to begin this process which will involve consultation with those who use my Department's services and who will be invited to make submissions to the preparation of the scheme. When completed, the draft scheme will be presented to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the 28 March, 2005. I do not expect this scheme will give rise to significant additional costs and, consequently, it has not been necessary to make explicit separate or additional provision for this in the 2005 Estimates for my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1917">The Office of the Attorney General updates its website by displaying the Acts, statutory instruments and chronological tables for the previous year. The indexing and preparatory work for the 2003 version of the chronological tables is complete. This work can only be finalised as and when all of the Acts and the full texts of the statutory instruments become available. The work involved is complex and time consuming as it involves an examination of each Act and statutory instrument in order to record any changes to existing legislation. Accordingly, the office is only in a position to publish the updated tables towards the end of each subsequent year and 2004 is no exception in relation to the publication of the 2003 data. The office expects that the 2003 data will be available on its website by year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">Acts of the Houses of the Oireachtas are made available on that office's website which is linked to the Office of the Attorney General website.</p>

            <p eId="para_2209">I propose to take QuestionsNos. 174 and 175 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">In the course of normal trade, food products may be recalled or withdrawn from the market from time to time for a variety of reasons. Usually, the manufacturer or distributor will make arrangements to notify purchasers and, where appropriate, will also notify the authorities. Notices of recalls or withdrawals are placed at the point of sale or in the press.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the national contact point for the EU-wide rapid alert system for food and feed. Through this system, member states notify each other when a food product poses, or where there is reason to believe, may pose a danger to consumers. The FSAI examines all notifications and, where appropriate, issues a notice, known as a food alert, to official agencies engaged in food safety and to industry and consumer organisations. Food alerts are issued promptly by email, fax and SMS text message and details are also published on the FSAI website. In serious cases press releases are issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">Food alerts contain detailed information, including, where necessary, instructions to environmental health officers for the monitoring of recalls and/or the taking of samples to be analysed by the official food control laboratories. Monitoring continues until the issue is resolved. In addition, ongoing random testing may be included in the annual food surveillance and testing programme agreed between the FSAI and the official agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">Section 54 of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998 allows the FSAI and the health boards to issue a prohibition order where activities, including the storage or distribution of food involve, or are likely to involve, a serious risk to public health. A prohibition order is, in effect, an order to withdraw food from sale. The FSAI publishes details of such orders on its website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2214">Information shared through the rapid alert system can lead to the early identification of contamination problems. In such cases the Commission and the member states act together to deal with the matter. In many cases legislation to restrict or prohibit particular foods containing excess contaminant levels has been introduced by the Commission. Recent examples include aflatoxin contamination of peanuts from Egypt and of pistachio nuts from Iran. Member states are obliged to undertake such monitoring and testing as set down in the relevant EU decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2215">Another more recent example concerns the detection of the dye Sudan Red 1 in hot chilli products from India. The initial information was sent to the European Commission by France. Following detailed consideration, two Commission decisions were issued prohibiting the placing on the market of products found to contain Sudan Red 1. In Ireland, national legislation giving effect to these decisions was introduced by my predecessor as Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2216">I am satisfied that arrangements in place in this country provide a very high level of protection for consumers and that the procedures and systems for dealing with such matters, at national and European level, are kept under constant review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2217">From January 2005, food businesses will be legally obliged under Regulation (EC) No. 178-2002 to have systems and procedures in place to handle product withdrawals and recalls effectively. Where a company considers that food imported, produced, processed, manufactured or distributed is not in compliance with the food safety requirements, it will be required to initiate procedures for the immediate withdrawal and/or recall of the food in question from the market. The company must also, in certain circumstances, inform the competent authorities of the actions taken to prevent risks to consumers. To assist businesses the FSAI has published a guidance note on product recall and traceability.</p>

            <p eId="para_2250">The Deputy may wish to note the 200 increase in whole-time equivalent terms, 70%, in the number of speech and language therapists employed in the health services between 1997 and 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">The continued implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body as well as the report of the expert group on various health professions which included new pay scales and career structures, the availability of the fast track working visa scheme and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications are designed to help sustain the improvements in staffing levels achieved for speech and language therapy services, both at local and national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2252">In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, three new speech and language therapy courses commenced in the 2003-04 academic year in UCC, NUIG and UL. In total, these courses will provide an additional 75 training places in speech and language therapy. This expansion in training numbers was identified in the Bacon report as necessary to meet the long-term demand-supply balance for speech and language therapists in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2253">I have been informed that the speech and language therapy services in the North Western Health Board undertook one week residential courses for persons who had to contend with a stammer. There was very clear tangible evidence of success demonstrated by the participants and this success encouraged the Irish Stammering Association to make an application to the chief executive officers of the health boards to locate a national centre of excellence in Carrick-on-Shannon. The submission is under active consideration by the directors of disability and I understand that it is hoped to forward a detailed proposal to the Health Service Executive-Department of Health and Children in early 2005.</p>

However, section 1(6) of the Registration of Births Act 1996 provides that where an entry in the register of births contains the name of the father of the child, the provisions for the re-registration of a birth under section 1(4) of the Legitimacy Act 1931 do not apply.

            <p eId="para_2302">The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, which has the statutory responsibility for licensing all pharmaceutical products for use in Ireland, collects data from health care professionals on suspected adverse effects and quality defects in relation to each publicly funded vaccination programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">The following tables provide information on the numbers of adverse drug reactions, ADR, reports notified to the IMB in respect of publicly funded vaccines from January 2000 to October 2004, which is the most recent period for which figures are available from the IMB. It should be noted that these tables reflect the total number of reported cases and cannot be considered as incidence figures as the total number of ADRs occurring is not known.</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">The term "severe" is a subjective one and as such is not used in a regulatory context for classifying suspected ADRs which are either serious or non-serious. A serious ADR is defined as one which is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability-incapacity, results in or prolongs hospitalisation. This definition also includes congenital abnormalities or birth defects and serious adverse clinical consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">The tables therefore include the total number of cases for each of the vaccines and the total number of serious cases, many of which are classified as such because they required some level of treatment or intervention and thus fall into the category of "adverse clinical consequences".</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">The number of ADRs received are within the expected frequency of occurrence of the reactions. However, it should be noted that a high number of ADR reports for meningitis C vaccines were received following active encouragement by the Office for Health Gain and the IMB for notification of all ADRs observed following administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2307">Reports of suspected ADRs notified to the IMB associated with use of publicly funded vaccines in the period referred to are set out in the following tables:</p>

          <summary eId="sum_92">In Ireland immunisation uptake is routinely calculated on a quarterly basis among children 12 and 24 months of age. The statistics collected relate to children who have received three doses of vaccines against diphtheria, D3, pertussis, P3, tetanus, T3,Haemophilus influenzae type b, Hib3, polio, Polio3, meningococcal group C, MenC3, one dose of vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, MMR1; uptake at 24 months only, and one dose of BCG vaccine, BCG: uptake at 12 months only. The following table shows the national immunisation uptake rates for children aged 24 months from Q1-2000 to Q2-2004, the latest figures available from the NDSC. In Q2-2004, the national uptake rates for D3, T3, P3 Hib3 and Polio3 were 88-89% at 24 months. The uptake rate for MenC3 was 87% and the uptake rate for MMR1 was 81%. Uptake statistics relating to BCG vaccine for children aged 12 months was first collected in Ireland in Q3-2003. At present, data are available for five of the eight health boards, covering less than half of the national birth cohort. In Q2-2004 BCG uptake was 90% and over the past year, national BCG uptake has ranged from 87% to 91%. Currently, data relating to other vaccinations recommended in the childhood immunisation schedule are not routinely collected.</summary>

It can be deduced from this that the number of ADRs is low compared to the number of vaccines administered. For instance, the uptake of MMR in 2002 averaged 72.5% which equates to 120,501 vaccine doses administered in that year. This compares with 15 serious adverse drug reactions in the same year.</summary>

            <p eId="para_2738">The State Claims Agency, SCA, established in 2002, manages personal injury claims against the State. Information provided by the SCA indicates that four claims have been received from parents regarding alleged vaccine damage from the State supported MMR vaccine programme. No claims have been received by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2739">Information provided by the health authority-boards indicates that no claims have been received by the following: Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA; Midland Health Board, MHB; Mid-Western Health Board, MWHB; North Eastern Health Board, NEHB; North Western Health Board, NWHB; Southern Health Board, SHB. The South Eastern Health Board has received solicitors' letters regarding three incidents. These claims relate to the BCG, meningitis and 3 in 1 vaccine programmes. However, there have been no further proceedings in relation to these cases. The Western Health Board reports that two claims have been received regarding alleged reactions to the BCG vaccine.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">Complaints associated with the vaccination programme have been received by the following health boards: Mid-Western Health Board, two written complaints in relation to meningitis C vaccination programme, one with respect to the management of faintness following vaccination and one because a child had received the meningitis C vaccine twice. Parents are asked to report adverse reactions to vaccinations to the health board. The board is regularly advised verbally of local reactions to vaccinations but these would not be considered unusual or unexpected. The board was made aware in 2003 of a number of BCG alleged reactions which were more extensive than expected. In the South Eastern Health Board complaints received relate to incorrect BCG vaccination and alleged adverse reactions to meningitis, 3 in 1 and BCG vaccination. In the Southern Health Board the board has been contacted by a parent where in their view their child's reaction was caused by a vaccine. In each instance no conclusive evidence was found to support the views. The vaccines involved were 4 in 1, meningitis C, 2 in 1 primary, hib, 5 in 1-meningitis C primary and MMR.</p>
            <p eId="para_2741">The immunisation programme currently operated in this country has played a major part in bringing serious, previously common diseases under control. It is very important that parents continue to have their children immunised in order that children continue to be protected against the diseases concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_2792">From 1 June 2004, the European health insurance card replaced the E111, E119, E110 and E128 forms. Prior to this date, an Irish student travelling to the UK to study a recognised course was required to obtain E128 from his or her local health board. A valid E128, issued prior to 1 June 2004, may still be used as evidence of entitlement until the expiry date on the form.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">The European health insurance card entitles people to receive health care in the public system as necessary while on a temporary stay in another EU or EEA member state or Switzerland, taking into account the nature of the care and the expected length of stay. The card does not grant entitlement to any treatment where the aim of the journey is to obtain treatment. The regulation covers public treatment only and any person who opts for private treatment is liable for any expenses incurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2794">However, Ireland and the United Kingdom waived the requirement to produce EU forms and the European health insurance card between each other. It is only necessary for Irish residents in the UK on a temporary visit to provide proof of residence in Ireland, in the event that they require necessary treatment, as covered by the European health insurance card.</p>
            <p eId="para_2795">An Irish student studying in the UK who returns to Ireland for a temporary stay and is accepted by the health board as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1 medical card holders, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Persons aged 16 to 25 years who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_586">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2816">Tax relief is available in respect of donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to eligible charities and other approved bodies, including first and second level schools and third level institutions, including universities. An eligible charity for the purpose of tax relief on donations is any charity in the State which has been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners as an eligible charity and which holds charitable exempt status from the Revenue Commissioners for at least three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2817">The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes to any one eligible charity or approved body is €250 per annum. There is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated generally and qualify for relief. Donations must be in the form of money and donations for any one year can be on a cumulative basis. A weekly donation of €5 per week can therefore qualify for the relief. The relief on the donation is at the individual's marginal rate of tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">The arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations, which are provided for in section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment, or a company. For a PAYE taxpayer, the relief is given on a "grossed-up" basis to the approved body rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. For example, if an individual who pays income tax at the higher rate of 42% gives a donation of €580 to an approved body, the body will be deemed to have received €1,000 less tax of €420. The approved body will, therefore, be able to claim a refund of €420 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year. Similarly, if a standard rate taxpayer makes a donation of €800 to an approved body, the approved body will be able to claim a refund of €200 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis and by companies, it is the donor and not the recipient of the donation who claims the relief. In the case of an individual, the donation can be claimed as a deduction against the individual's income from all sources. In the case of companies, the donation is effectively treated as an ordinary business expense which is deductible in determining the company's tax liability. The claim to the relief is made with the individual's or company's normal tax return. Any refund of tax arising by virtue of the donation is repayable to the donor and not to the eligible charity. There is, of course, the presumption that the potential donor will be aware of the tax relief available and that the level of the donation will reflect that knowledge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">Some taxpayers, however, are chargeable persons for the purposes of self-assessment but also pay tax under the PAYE system. These taxpayers must claim the tax relief on their donation through their tax return in common with all self-assessed taxpayers. They cannot be included in claims being made by charities in respect of wholly PAYE taxpayers. To do so would be to grant the relief twice. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this particular aspect of the scheme has resulted in some difficulties for charities in compiling claims for repayment. Frequently, such claims include donors who have had a mix of PAYE and self-assessed income for the year, a fact not known to the claiming bodies and as a result incorrect claims have had to be reduced in a number of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in general, the arrangements work reasonably well and, therefore, I am not convinced that a change to the scheme along the lines implied by the Deputy's question is warranted at this stage. Full details of the tax relief scheme, including details on how to claim the relief, are set out in the information booklet CHY2, a copy of which will be sent to the Deputy. The details are also available on the Revenue Commissioners' website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2823">Married couples living together may opt for joint assessment where they may transfer unused credits and bands between spouses, subject to certain restrictions. The restrictions relate to the employee tax credit which is allocated on an individual basis and is non-transferable and to transferability of the standard rate band for a married couple which is limited to €37,000. The majority of married couples opt for joint assessment as, because of the transferability between them, it can be more advantageous to them than treatment as two single persons. Within joint assessment, a married couple may opt for separate assessment. Under this option they will be treated as single persons but their combined tax bill will be the same as under joint assessment. Couples may also elect for assessment as single persons where each spouse is taxed on his or her own income, each receives the credits and the standard band due to a single person and there is no transferability of unused credits and bands. As regards other taxes, a spouse may receive gifts and inheritances from the other spouse without paying capital acquisitions tax. There are also certain exemptions for married couples in the capital gains tax and stamp duty codes. The tax system does not recognise couples other than married couples.</p>
            <p eId="para_2824">For capital acquisitions tax purposes, there are different thresholds for the different categories listed in the question. However, an individual may be able to avail of dwelling house relief. Essentially, capital acquisitions tax no longer applies on the transfer of the home on or after 1 December 1999, provided the dwelling-house was occupied continuously by the beneficiary as his or her only or main residence for a period of three years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance. The beneficiary must not have an interest in any other residential property. It is also a condition of the exemption that the beneficiary must own and reside in the dwelling-house for six years after the date of the gift or inheritance. This condition does not apply where the beneficiary is over 55 years of age or where the beneficiary is unable to comply with the residence requirements for reasons outside his or her control, for example, due to work obligations or hospitalisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2827">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there were two phases to their investigation into the holders of bogus non-resident accounts. Phase one consisted of an incentive scheme designed to ensure that the maximum possible number of taxpayers who held such accounts and who had undisclosed tax liabilities came forward voluntarily, made settlements and paid the outstanding amounts as quickly as possible. This approach was consistent with the recommendation by the Committee of Public Accounts in its final report on the DIRT inquiry:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2828">The Revenue Commissioners give consideration to dealing with the assessment and collection of the underlying tax in a pragmatic and effective manner while safeguarding the overall tax revenues of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">This phase included a guarantee that those who voluntarily disclosed would not be investigated with a view to prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">Phase two, which is still ongoing, consists of following through those bogus account holders who did not voluntarily disclose. In such cases the tax, interest and penalties are collected and, if they fall within the criteria in section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the names of the individuals involved are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. Such individuals may also be considered for prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2831">Revenue's prosecution programme is conducted on the basis of identifying cases of serious evasion regardless of the means used to hide the undisclosed income or gains. This has resulted in bogus non-resident account holders being considered for investigation and where the evidence or likely evidence appeared good enough investigations have been initiated. To date one taxpayer whose evasion involved the holding of a bogus non-resident deposit account, was successfully prosecuted. This individual received a two year suspended sentence. In addition, the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that proceedings should be taken against another such taxpayer and this case will appear in the courts in due course. It is likely that some further cases will be considered and if sufficient admissible evidence can be assembled they will also be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">To date €557 million in tax, interest and penalties has been recovered by the Revenue Commissioners from bogus account holders. This sum relates to about 12,000 taxpayers. Many of the account holders did not have any additional tax liabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2839">As I previously advised to the Deputy in a reply to a parliamentary question on 5 October 2004, capital gains tax is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of capital gains tax now applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land which is the subject of a compulsory purchase order. It was announced in the 2003 budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when capital gains tax rates were much higher than current levels. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement. The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base to keep direct tax rates low. Reliefs and allowances made sense when capital gains tax rates were 40% and above. In the 1998 budget, the rate was halved from 40% to 20%. Taxing capital gains when they are realised is the most logical time to do so, and this change brought capital gains tax into line with other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2840">It is not the practice to comment in the lead up to the annual Budget Statement and Finance Bill on the intention or otherwise to make changes in taxation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2844">The main area of expenditure on the Irish language in my Department is through Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí. Gaeleagras was established in the Department in 1971 with the general aim of promoting the Irish language throughout the Civil Service. Gaeleagras continues to make a significant contribution to the promotion and development of the use of Irish in the Civil Service including supporting the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003. As Gaeleagras provides an integrated service including training provision, translation and proficiency testing, it is not possible to identify that proportion of expenditure which relates specifically to the implementation of the Act. The total allocation for Gaeleagras in 2004 is €250,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2845">Outside Gaeleagras, work relating to implementing the Official Languages Act 2003 is spread across the Department and is undertaken in conjunction with officials' existing duties. It is, therefore, not possible to provide an overall cost for the implementation of the Act in the Department in 2004. However, the additional costs incurred by the Department associated with using external translation services, printing and advertising arising from the Act is estimated at around €35,000 in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2846">The information requested by the Deputy on spending by public bodies or agencies funded by my Department is being compiled and will be forwarded to him as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2927">The table indicates, with the exception of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme and the productive sector operational programme, the breakdown of expenditure between the two regions is broadly consistent with the original national development plan forecasts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2928">Expenditure is well behind target in the productive sector operational programme due to the fact that the original forecast and its regional breakdown were set at unrealistic levels in the light of activity in the area since the national development plan was launched in 1999. The economic and social infrastructure operational programme is the largest one and the key programme for national development plan investment in infrastructure. The BMW region is behind forecast spend under this operational programme because major infrastructure projects in the southern and eastern region, especially in the areas of roads and public transport, had to receive priority due to the major pressures on infrastructure in the region, notably in the greater Dublin area. The BMW region benefits from investment in transport, particularly in roads, in the southern and eastern region because transport links to the major ports and airports and national markets, particularly Dublin, in the region benefit the whole country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2929">It is my objective that as major projects in the southern and eastern region are completed, more funds will become available over the remainder of the national development plan for investment in infrastructure in the BMW region so that progress can be made on rectifying the existing imbalance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2945">The urban renewal scheme provides for a targeted approach to the use of tax incentives to assist in the rejuvenation of certain urban areas. The designation and selection approach adopted for this scheme involved the preparation and submission of integrated area plans by local authorities.

The office of the President receives a print-out from the Department of Social and Family Affairs at year's end which lists persons in receipt of social welfare pensions. The office of the President depends on relatives, friends and managers of nursing homes to inform it of centenarians who are not in receipt of social welfare pensions.

            <p eId="para_2953">The rules governing landings by EU fishing vessels fishing for mackerel, horse mackerel — northern stocks — and herring — northern stocks — are set down in annex IV of Council Regulation 2287/2003. The rules apply to landings at all member states and require the following in respect of all landings greater than ten tonnes. The master of a fishing vessel must give four hours advance notice of landing including specified details of the catch to the competent authorities of the member state into which the landing is to take place. The member state designates ports for landing these species. The competent authorities of the member state shall require that the discharge does not commence until authorised to do so. The master of a fishing vessel must submit immediately upon arrival to port the relevant pages of his logbook. The fish must be weighed by the buyers, in, the presence of a controller before being sorted, processed and transported. As part of the EU-Norway fisheries agreement, similar provisions are in place in respect of landings of these pelagic species by Irish and other vessels into Norway.</p>
            <p eId="para_2954">Under the provisions governing the logbook, a copy of the log sheet and landing declaration must be sent to the Irish authorities within 48 hours of landing. This applies to landings into Irish, EU and Norwegian ports. The Irish authorities report on landings to the EU Commission in respect of landings into Irish ports and into non-member state ports, including those in Norway. Landings into other member state ports are reported by the member state concerned. Landings of stocks by Irish vessels into non-Irish ports are subject to any additional rules, which may apply at national level in the relevant country.</p>

            <p eId="para_2969">Media Lab Europe, or MLE, was formed through a series of tripartite agreements between the State, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MIT Media Lab and has been in operation since early 2000. It was established to conduct non-directed research in the field of digital media. While it is acknowledged that research will generally require State support, the uniqueness of the MLE model as presented initially to Government was that it would be self-funding by 2005. However, MLE has consistently failed to meet its financial projections. Circumstances have deteriorated significantly over the past 24 months. At its current rate of expenditure, its funding should take MLE to the end of the first quarter of 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2970">In view of these developments, the Government liaison committee, which brings together Departments with an interest in the MLE operation, wrote to MLE in February 2004 requesting that it undertake a fundamental review of its business model and produce a strategic plan. The board of MLE submitted its strategic plan to the Department on 7 May 2004 and included a request for additional Exchequer funding of €9 million. Considering the importance of digital media in the broader information and communications technology sector and the need for commitment to research and development in the field, a comprehensive assessment of the current model and structures at MLE was required. This having been done, I am considering possible options for the future of MLE.</p>

            <p eId="para_2980">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the fully liberalised private sector as regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation. In response to underinvestment by the sector in the late 1990s in the infrastructure necessary to deliver broadband nationwide, the Government set aside an indicative €200 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. These moneys are aimed to fund creation of high-speed fibre infrastructure in towns and cities to facilitate the provision of broadband by private sector companies. A total of 19 metropolitan area fibre networks, or MANs, have already been built and a further seven are under construction. The networks are being managed independently on an open-access basis and offer the service providers access to high-bandwidth services at competitive costs. The MANs which have been completed are already carrying commercial traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_2981">Phase 2 of the programme, which is now under way, will see the rollout of broadband infrastructure to over 90 towns with populations of 1,500 and to others which are not being provided with broadband by private telecommunications companies. Calls for proposals have issued in respect of 41 of those towns, including Bantry, and it is expected that contracts will be in place before the end of this year. Proposals will be sought for the remaining towns in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2982">There are encouraging signs that the availability of broadband is increasing rapidly. A number of firms are advertising the availability of broadband connectivity anywhere in the country which is provided using a variety of delivery platforms including fibre, wireless, satellite and digital subscriber lines. Details of these firms, including prices and contact numbers, can be found on my Department's website at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</p>

Under section 19 of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation is required to prepare and publish an annual forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand on Ireland's natural gas system over a seven year period. The 2004 capacity statement was published on 12 November and includes a range of possible demand scenarios that may be expected to arise over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3016">The gas capacity statement indicates that our infrastructure is sufficiently robust to cater for the majority of scenarios modelled. Only in the case of the highest demand forecast, in tandem with delays to the coming on stream of indigenous supply sources, would reinforcements to the infrastructure be envisaged. The CER is working with Bord Gáis Éireann, as the transmission system operator, to investigate the requirements for reinforcing the onshore Scotland system, should the need arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_3017">In relation to supply, it is clear that the geographic sources of gas for north west Europe are changing over coming years, but there is no particular threat to Irish supplies. The market is close to being fully liberalised and there will be several suppliers. The Kinsale field continues to provide Ireland with some supply of gas and supplies coming from the Corrib and Seven Heads fields would reduce Ireland's import demands in the coming years. My Department will continue to monitor the supply situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3019">There is no oil drilling exploration in hand. There are 37 current authorisations for petroleum, which covers both oil and gas. The latest acreage report which sets out details of the authorisations and the companies involved is set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_3020">New exploration for non-petroleum minerals is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of prospecting licences, of which there were 273 current on 1 November 2004. Details of the holders of these licenses can be found in the six monthly report to the Oireachtas which I am obliged to lay before the House under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ended 30 June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3021">With regard to positive indications from these explorations, I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to Questions Nos. 44 and 126 on 21 October 2004. The position has not changed since then.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3244">Conventional wisdom is that renewable energy technologies employed in the electricity market will continue to require special support into the medium term in order to compete in an open competitive electricity market. My Department's support mechanism, the alternative energy requirement programme has operated to date to increase the contribution from renewable energy technologies in electricity production.</p>
            <p eId="para_3245">The underlying principle of the alternative energy requirement competitions as operated to date is that prospective generators are invited to make a formal application to build, own and operate newly installed renewable energy based electricity generating plant, and to supply electricity from these to the ESB under a power purchase agreement of up to 15 years. Full details of the AER programme, including those producers who took part in the process, are available on my Department's website at <i>www.dcmnr.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3246">Large scale hydro-powered electricity generating stations can compete with conventional fossil fuel technologies in an open competitive environment. In addition, some wind-powered electricity generating plant has been developed in Ireland as merchant plant, that is, without support, in recent years. However, these projects depend on a regulatory code that reassures consumers that the electricity they consume is associated with the generation of an equal amount of electricity from alternative energy sources within a 12-month cycle. This activity was facilitated by the accelerated liberalisation of the electricity market for renewable energy technologies which occurred in February 2000 ahead of full market liberalisation in 2005. I do not have details of the producers working in this market as they operate outside of the programmes run by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">In general terms, the cost effectiveness league table for alternative non-fossil electrical energy in descending order would be large scale hydro followed by large scale on-shore wind with large scale wind having the greatest untapped potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_3250">It is inherent in the way that the electricity system works that, with some exceptions, such as peat and wind energy which get preferential treatment, generation plant is allowed onto the system in response to fluctuating demand, based on efficiency as represented by cost. This is commonly known in the business as merit order.</p>
            <p eId="para_3251">Clearly there are issues around whether the cost in each case is fully inclusive of, for example, environmental degradation. The arrival of the emissions trading scheme should increasingly lead to greater transparency in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_3252">I should also point out that with the development of Ireland's gas infrastructure, gas is playing an increasingly important role in power generation. The advent of combined cycle gas turbine technology means that new gas plants are much more energy efficient and less environmentally harmful than the more traditional fossil fuel plants. I understand there is ample information and literature in the public domain around this topic.</p>

            <p eId="para_3271">Although the telecommunications market is fully liberalised, and the provision of services is driven by commercial imperatives, until early 2003 infrastructure investment by the private sector had failed to keep pace with the demand for broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_3272">Recognising the lack of investment by the private sector in high-speed infrastructure, the Government set aside an indicative €200 million under the NDP for infrastructure developments that would enable the provision of services by the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3273">The creation of high-capacity backbone infrastructure and metropolitan area networks, MANs, are the cornerstones of the programme. Nineteen MANs have now been completed, and seven more are under construction. In the next phase of the programme broadband networks will be rolled out in over 90 towns of 1,500 population and more. The MANs are being managed for the State on an open-access basis, and offer private sector telecommunications providers wholesale rates for bandwidth that are on a par with the best available in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_3274">The availability of broadband is increasing. Telecommunications companies are now vigorously marketing digital subscriber line broadband in all areas, while other broadband technologies such as satellite, wireless and cable are growing in popularity. The number of broadband customers is growing by more than 30% per quarter and has increased 80 fold in the past year to over 105,000 customers today. These figures place Ireland favourably in the league tables, and indicate that the Government's objective is attainable.</p>

            <p eId="para_3302">The current EU rules allow for the grant aiding of fishing vessels for works that do not concern capacity in terms of tonnage or power. A grant aid scheme to support the purchase of safety equipment for fishing vessels, including vessels that have been granted a fishing boat license offer under the special scheme for the licensing of small fishing boats, which have a record of active commercial pot fishing, is being administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara. This grant scheme covers essential equipment including lifesaving, fire fighting, navigation and occupational safety. Details of the grant scheme is available from BIM and can be downloaded together with application forms from the BIM website at <i>www.bim.ie</i>. I have asked BIM to work closely with the vessel owners concerned in order to ensure that they can avail fully of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3303">The EU policy, which precludes the payment of grant aid towards fleet renewal and fleet modernisation, where capacity is involved, is regarded as a cornerstone of the reform of the CFP by the Commission and it has not proposed any change in this policy in the proposals for aid for the fisheries sector for the period 2007-2013, which were published in July 2004. At last week's Fisheries Council, I sought changes to allow for such aid for inshore vessels. While I will continue to pursue this objective, there was significant opposition from member states to any change in the current position on grant aid for fleet renewal and modernisation.</p>

A high level of co-operation exists between EU member states relating to these areas. There have been discussion papers and proposals at various stages to establish an EU coastguard aimed especially at drug interdiction and intervention on the high seas. There are, however, no firm proposals at the moment, at European level to develop policies in that direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">With regard to fisheries control under the Common Fisheries Policy, the EU has decided on the establishment of a Community control agency, which will be based in Spain. Control and enforcement is an important element of the objective to ensure sustainability of fish stocks. Many fish stocks migrate between different jurisdictions of member states and there is, therefore, a requirement for effective co-ordination and co-operation in fisheries control and enforcement. A key objective of the proposed Community fisheries control agency is to improve such co-operation and co-ordination between member states and, accordingly, I welcome the establishment of this agency.</p>

            <p eId="para_3311">In line with the Government's commitment to setting out a long-term strategy for the sustainable development of the Irish fishing industry, a policy statement on the future directions for the sustainable development of the sea fishing industry was made in June of this year. This statement includes a plan to deliver sustainable fishing for the whitefish fleet, an infrastructural development plan, a management plan for sustainable inshore fishing fleet and outlines the priorities for Ireland within the Common Fisheries Policy. I am committed to the early achievement of these objectives, which will enhance the viability of the industry going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_3312">With regard to the total allowable catch for the stocks mentioned by the Deputy, the reduction in the TAC for mackerel for 2005, which was decided in negotiations between the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands, is unfortunate for the fishermen concerned but it is hoped this reduction will prevent the stock falling into difficulty in the future. With regard to the other stocks mentioned, the TACs, and days at sea where applicable, will be decided at Fisheries Council in December, where I will work to achieve the best deal for Irish fishermen consistent with the overriding requirement of ensuring long-term sustainability of fish stocks.</p>

            <p eId="para_3318">Overall policy on emigrant services is the responsibility of my Department. A dedicated unit — the Irish abroad unit — was established last September to drive progress in this area. This important initiative facilitates the Government's efforts and relationship with Irish communities abroad. I am delighted that its establishment has been so warmly welcomed by our partners in the voluntary sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">The needs of our emigrants can best be met by a collective effort involving Governmental and voluntary agencies. The new unit is giving a fresh impetus and coherency to this collective effort. It is promoting progress on a wide range of initiatives, which build on the report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants. It has responsibility for managing my Department's financial support for the voluntary organisations engaged in the delivery of front line advice and counselling services to our emigrants, particularly the more vulnerable and marginalised members of our community abroad. I am delighted that the funds available to support the invaluable work of such organisations will again increase substantially next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">Four members of staff are assigned to the Irish abroad unit, which is headed by a senior Irish diplomat. Officials of the unit are active on the ground in developing contacts with the full range of partners involved in emigrant services. They have to date had meetings with Departments and agencies engaged in the provision of services to emigrants in Ireland. Members of the unit have also had meetings with organisations that provide front line services to Irish people in the USA, London, Birmingham and Coventry. Further meetings are being planned in London and Lancashire before Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3321">The maintenance and development of such contacts by the unit ensures that the voluntary organisations engaged in the provision of emigrant services are aware they have an effective channel of communication to the Government. In this way, the Irish abroad unit will ensure the needs of our emigrants are accorded the highest priority and that our response to their needs is effective and increases further in the period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_3351">No distinction is made in many jurisdictions outside Ireland between solicitors and barristers. It is possible, therefore, to give only the composite amount that was paid to lawyers out of Vote 28 subhead 6 and Vote 29. In 2003, the only payment from subhead A3 to a barrister was a payment of €8,131 paid to Mr. Paul McGarry, barrister at law, for advice provided to delegates to the European Convention. The remaining payments from A3 in 2003 and all payments in 2004 were either paid to firms abroad, to firms of solicitors or, in one case, to an academic. The legal advice in connection with the automated passport system was received also from a firm of solicitors. While all payments in Ireland, apart from the one referred to above, were made to firms of solicitors, the Department would not be aware whether those who provided advice were also qualified as barristers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3358">As regards my Department, the tourism division was restructured, with the establishment and resourcing of a new impact assessment unit that provides the secretariat to the high level group I appointed in January 2004 to oversee the implementation of the first two-year tourism action plan. The two tourism State agencies and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, also support the secretariat.</p>
            <p eId="para_3359">My Department is using the implementation group consultation process, together with its membership of interdepartmental working groups and consultative fora, as a mechanism for more effective interaction with other Departments whose policies impact on tourism. This process has started well with a particularly productive dialogue developing with the Departments of Transport and Finance during the first six months of the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3360">The Department also made a number of contributions to draft submissions to Government on issues that impact on tourism, for example, the White Paper on Regulation, insurance reform, waste management, housing guidelines and the transport reform agenda, with a view to influencing the wider agenda in favour of tourism development. It has also been agreed that the Department will participate at future meetings of the National Competitiveness Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_3364">Irish Genealogy Limited is in receipt of funding from year to year from my Department. My Department allocated €380,000 in 2004. The financial allocation for 2005 is under consideration. Irish Genealogy Limited provides marketing and information technology support to a network of 35 genealogical centres. It also operates a central index, which is used to direct potential customers to the appropriate centre. I am advised by Irish Genealogy Limited that it employs 51 full-time staff and 20 part-time staff together with 203 trainees. These staff are funded mainly by FÁS with some funding from local authorities. Each centre makes its own arrangement. In addition, there is considerable voluntary input. Neither my Department nor Irish Genealogy Limited has a direct role in employment at the centres. Irish Genealogy Limited has provided the following listing, giving the staff numbers at individual centres. It is understood that there are other genealogical centres, which do not participate in this project. Numbers employed at 35 IGL supported centres:</p>

            <p eId="para_3517">The legal metrology service of the National Standards Authority of Ireland implements the provisions of the Metrology Acts 1980 to 1998. One of the objectives of the legislation is to ensure fair trade and consumer protection by checking the accuracy of measuring instruments used in trade throughout the economy. The law imposes obligations on traders to ensure that the measuring instruments they use in trade are of an approved type and have been verified by the legal metrology service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3518">Enforcement of metrology law is both a personnel and equipment intensive operation. However, failure to undertake this responsibility to an adequate technical level, as required by law, exposes consumers and traders to unfair competition, misleading trading practices and potential fraud.</p>
            <p eId="para_3519">Section 4 of the Metrology Act 1996, as amended, provides that the National Standards Authority of Ireland may with the consent of the Minister charge fees for, <i>inter alia</i>, verification services. When recently considering the basis for a fee increase, the board of the authority was of the view that the fee set should be such as to fully recover the costs associated with the verification process. These costs have not been fully recovered in previous years. To enable full cost recovery, the board proposed an increase in the verification fee for taxi meters from €32 to €75, excluding VAT, and this increase was consented to.</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">Verification of taxi meters is required upon initial installation, following repair-adjustment or the installation of a revised schedule of taxi fares. As a result, the number of taxi meters submitted for verification varies from year to year. The revenue from taxi meter verification in 2003 was €203,000 while that for 2004 is estimated at €160,000. Comparisons of revenue generated are not a reliable yardstick as the number of taxis requiring verification in any one year can vary significantly. However, if all licensed taxis were verified, the additional revenue generated by this increase would be €559,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_3524">I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 to 314, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3525">Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety came into force on 15 January 2004. The European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations 2004 — SI No. 199 of 2004 — which transposed the EU directive into Irish law was signed by the Tánaiste on 4 May 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3526">The new general product safety directive, GPSD, puts the onus on producers to place only safe products on the market. Distributors are obliged to act with due care to help to ensure compliance, in particular by not supplying products which they know or should have presumed on the basis of the information in their possession, do not comply with the applicable safety requirements of the directive. Article 5(3) of the directive requires producers and distributors, if they become aware, that a product which they have placed on the market poses a risk to the consumer that are incompatible with the general safety requirements, they should immediately inform the relevant competent authority. The Director of Consumer Affairs has been designated the relevant authority in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3527">The director, in line with the requirements of the general product safety directive, provides details of all notifications of withdrawals-recalls to the European Commission and to all member states, through a rapid alert information procedure called RAPEX. The European Commission updates the notifications received from all member states on a weekly basis on its website, <i>http://europa.eu.int/comm/consumers/cons_safe/prod_safe/gpsd/rapex_en.htm</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3528">Since the new directive came into force, the director followed up on in excess of 300 notifications compared with 64 last year by conducting searches on the market place and alerting the relevant Irish distributors, wholesalers and retailers of the notifications. During the year the director issued a total of 14 RAPEX and recall notifications ranging from computers to motor cars. All initiatives relating to withdrawals-recalls were taken by the economic operators, without the need for the director to invoke her powers under the general product safety regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3529">There is no requirement under the directive to monitor the effectiveness of recalls. However, the director has drawn up a system whereby recalls will be evaluated on a six monthly basis over a two-year period. As all the recall notices were made to the office in the latter half of the year, statistical data on the progress on recalls will not be available until next year. In addition to following up on all RAPEX notifications and routine market surveillance, the office undertook two special projects on the safety of lamps under the low voltage directive and the safety of cots under the GPSD. The results of the findings of both projects are available at <i>www.odca.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3530">The new general product safety regulations provide on summary conviction for financial penalties of up to €3,000 or three months imprisonment or both in respect of an operator found to be in breach of the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3533">I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 316 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3534">The Health and Safety Authority is required to provide technical advice to planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála in respect of siting of new establishments, modification of an existing establishment and proposed development in the vicinity of an existing establishment, pursuant to regulation 29 of the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000, which transpose the Seveso directive into Irish law. That advice is based on a consideration of the hazards and risks to man and the environment arising from major accidents, which pertain to an existing or proposed establishment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3535">The consultation required by article 12 of the Seveso directive is that between competent authorities and planning authorities and these are reflected in the relevant provisions of the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. Where the HSA has provided general advice for land use planning around an establishment, known as generic advice and distinct from a response to a specific planning application, it is expected this will become part of the development plan for the area, which is subject to a public consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3536">However, the generation of the advice is a technical exercise based on a consideration of plant and chemical inventories and the advice tendered is from a template which proposes that certain types of development are appropriate for given levels of risk or hazard. This template is used to ensure impartiality and consistency of advice. The HSA facilitates discussions with landowners-developers who have an interest in land that has been covered by land use planning advice and it has a policy of reviewing generic advice on an annual basis to take account of changes that may have taken place since the provision of the advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3537">The issue of compensation for matters arising from the provision of land use advice by the HSA is outside the scope of the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000, SI 476 of 2000, which transpose the current Seveso directive into Irish law. Issues regarding compensation in respect of refusals of permission to develop land, or conditional grants of planning permission, are dealt with under the Planning and Development Act 2000, which is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_3544">The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents Governments from intervening in the matter. EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3545">I would also like to point out that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, under the aegis of the Minister for Finance, now regulates and supervises insurance undertakings since its establishment on 1 May 2003. The Minister for Finance retains overall responsibility for policy and legislation on the provision of financial services in Ireland, including insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3546">A key concern to which the Government is giving priority is the cost and availability of insurance. In this context, the Government launched a comprehensive set of inter-related measures, across a number of Departments designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3547">Key initiatives relating to my Department include the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which commenced operations on 1 June 2004, and the undertaking of a joint study into insurance by my Department in conjunction with the Competition Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3548">Key initiatives relating to the Department of Transport include action in the areas of road safety and driver behaviour, for example, the introduction of the penalty points system. A new Road Traffic Bill was published on 11 June 2004 and is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. A new road safety strategy was published in September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3549">Key initiatives relating to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform include reform of the law on personal injury claims. The Civil Liability and Courts Act, which includes measures to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law relating to personal injury claims was enacted on 21 July 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3550">The reform programme is contributing to reductions in insurance premia. The CSO consumer price index statistics show that there was a reduction of 19.2% in car insurance between the months of April 2003 and October 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3551">The primary ongoing insurance focus of my Department will be from the horizontal competitiveness perspective and competition, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, and to oversee the PIAB. The Minister for Transport has taken over the lead role on policy and legislation on the availability and cost of motor insurance and any related inter-departmental co-ordination.</p>

            <p eId="para_3569">I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3570">From 1 June 2004 all personal injury claims arising from workplace accidents, where an employee is seeking compensation from his or her employer, must be referred to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board before legal proceedings are issued. From 22 July 2004 PIAB's remit was extended to include all personal injury claims apart from those involving medical negligence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3571">The structure and staffing levels of the PIAB have been agreed. The PIAB, when fully operational, will have a staffing complement of up to 85 in addition to the CEO. The PIAB is also utilising an outsourced service centre to assist injured parties in completion of their claim submissions and ensure a comprehensive, fair and independent service is provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_3572">The recruitment and remuneration of staff is an operational matter for which the CEO of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has responsibility. I understand that following a significant recruitment campaign the PIAB has recruited sufficient staff to serve the current needs of its business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3573">While matters relating to the claims received by PIAB are also an operational matter for which the CEO has responsibility, latest figures available to me indicate that at the beginning of this month 7,475 calls had been received, 467,359 website hits had been recorded, and a total of 1,347 applications for assessment had been made, broken down as follows: 538 employer liability applications, 374 public liability applications and 435 motor accident applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3574">The establishment of the PIAB will lead to reduced insurance premia to the benefit of both consumers and businesses alike. By eliminating the need for litigation costs where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation. The PIAB will also offer speedier assessments to the benefit of claimants.</p>

            <p eId="para_3601">Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a disability who are aged between 16 and 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year. The allowance is subject to both medical suitability and a means test. However, under social welfare legislation payment may be made to a person other than the claimant where this is requested or appropriate in certain circumstances. Such persons are appointed to act as agents to, <i>inter alia,</i> collect payments on behalf of a claimant. Agents are appointed where a person is unable to cash their payment due to serious illness or loss of mobility. They may also be appointed in cases where a person is permanently unable to act for themselves or discharge responsibility generally due to severe mental incapacity. In many cases parents, guardians or other family members are appointed as agents.</p>
            <p eId="para_3602">The issue of how much a person in residential care or community housing should contribute to the cost of their care and maintenance is primarily a matter for the health service and the service provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_3603">It would seem reasonable that those receiving publicly-funded long-term care should make some contribution towards upkeep and maintenance if they can afford to do so, just as they would if they were living in the community. Under the nursing home subvention regulations 1993, a person in full time residential care must be allowed to retain an amount equivalent to one fifth of the amount of the old age non-contributory pension as a personal income.</p>
            <p eId="para_3604">Budget 2003 provided for the take-over by my Department of the discretionary pocket money allowances paid to people with disabilities in residential care who are not entitled to disability allowance and for the standardisation of the level of these allowances. My Department has undertaken an information gathering process with the health boards with a view to arranging for the transfer of responsibility for the payment of these allowances and of the funds involved. An assessment of the scale of the transfer and its implications for a more general removal of the residential care disqualification for disability allowance purposes will be made in the light of this transfer and having regard to available resources and priorities generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_3608">A person age 66 years or over may qualify for an old age non-contributory pension if she or he satisfies a means test. When calculating the means, all income and savings are taken into account including British retirement pension income. In the case of a married couple, the individual means of the husband and wife are taken to be half their joint means.</p>
            <p eId="para_3609">The wife of the couple in question is currently getting an old age non-contributory pension at a reduced rate of €130.50 per week inclusive of a fuel allowance of €9.00. Her entitlement to this pension is based on her weekly means as derived from her British retirement pension in October 2001 of IR£30.46.</p>
            <p eId="para_3610">Her husband is currently getting a disability allowance of €109.80 per week. However, his payment will cease in January 2005 when he reaches age 66 as disability allowance is not payable beyond that age. For this reason, he recently applied for an old age non-contributory pension in his own right. This necessitated a review of the couple's financial circumstances by a social welfare inspector. Following this review, a deciding officer assessed each of the couple with weekly means of €78.79 deriving from their two British retirement pensions. On this basis, they are both entitled to an old age non-contributory pension of €81.50 per week. Full details of how the means of the couple were calculated were posted to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3611">I understand that the Deputy also wishes to know if the husband in question would qualify for an old age contributory pension. One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of this pension is that the claimant must have a minimum of 260 full rate insurance contributions paid. An examination of his social insurance contribution record indicates that he does not satisfy this condition. For this reason, he would not qualify for this pension.</p>

Those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching were not affected by these changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3614">The conditions of the scheme were revised because it was considered that it needed to be refocused towards people who most need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market.

            <p eId="para_3644">The focus of the scheme has always been on those who have been out of employment for some time and who find it difficult to get a foothold in the labour market after a lengthy period of unemployment. People who have been recently employed are not in the target group for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3645">I am satisfied that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that the scheme supports those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.</p>

          <summary eId="sum_151">The movement from non-contributory to contributory pensions reflects the extension over the years of full social insurance coverage to various groups with, for example, the self employed in 1988, part-time workers in 1991 and public servants in 1995 being the most significant. At the same time, a number of special initiatives have been implemented such as the pre-53 pension in 2000, and the special pensions for self employed who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory social insurance was introduced for that group in 1988.</summary>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_3697">I propose to take Questions Nos. 350, 351, 364 and 368 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3698">Area Development Management Limited administers the rural transport initiative on behalf of my Department and makes specific allocations to individual RTI projects from funding provided under my Vote. Under this initiative, 34 rural community groups are currently being financed to operate pilot rural transport services in their areas. It is the function of each RTI group, in conjunction with ADM, to decide on the specific services to be funded from its allocation in line with its agreed business plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3699">I should point out that ADM has sole responsibility in deciding on the individual RTI allocations and neither I nor my Department has any function in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3700">The National Development Plan 2000-2006 makes a provision of €4.4 million for pilot projects under the rural transport initiative. However, given the positive response to the scheme, additional funding has been provided and by the end of this year my Department will have provided €9 million for the RTI in the three years 2002-2004. A full appraisal of the initiative was completed in July this year and in line with its principal recommendation, I recently extended the scheme for a further two years to end2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3701">There is a provisional allocation of €3 million for the RTI in the Abridged Estimates volume. Before the Estimates are finalised, I hope to be in a position to provide some increase to take account of increases in operating costs of the projects involved. This will result in an overall funding commitment of at least €12 million for the RTI to end 2005 which compares very favourably with the total of €4.4 million earmarked for the RTI in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3702">It should be borne in mind that the RTI projects also benefit each year from funding provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs arising from the application of the free travel scheme to the scheme. In addition, I know that some RTI projects are generating additional funds from the provision of transport services to health boards and from other sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3703">From the outset, RTI projects have been encouraged to explore innovative ways in which their services can be partly financed from the local economy in which they operate. Indeed, the degree to which prospective RTI groups put forward proposals for co-financing and the securing of additional resources from non-Exchequer sources were among the operational criteria used to assess the original applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3704">In deciding on the extension of the RTI to end-2006 I was conscious that many of the pilot projects only became fully operational in 2003. I was also conscious that continuing the RTI to end-2006 will ensure that the lifespan of the initiative will dovetail with the scope of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 in which the initiative was first mooted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3705">The extension will facilitate a more comprehensive appraisal of the effectiveness of the RTI in addressing the transport needs of rural areas. It will enable the 34 projects to further explore best practice models of transport provision and to strategically develop approaches to planning and co-ordinating transport services in areas whereit was traditionally considered difficult to doso.</p>

            <p eId="para_3714">I understand from the Dublin Airport Authority that the land holdings which were recently offered for public sale by the former Aer Rianta in the vicinity of Shannon Airport comprised 72 hectares approximately. Of this, about 15 hectares was compulsorily acquired in 1945 to cater for the further expansion of Shannon Airport. I am informed that, according to the Land Registry records, the names of the owners of these 15 hectares prior to 1945 were Ellen Fahey, Patrick Quinlivan and James McMahon. Aer Rianta acquired the remaining 57 acres by negotiation with the local owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3715">I understand that the possible sale of the 72 hectares in question is being reviewed by the Shannon Airport Board in the context of the current business planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3716">With regard to car parking charges at Dublin Airport, the fee rates applicable from 1 April 1977 were set out in the Dublin Airport (Parking Fees) By-Laws 1977, SI No. 92 of 1977. The Airport By-Laws 1994, SI No. 425 of 1994, provided at Regulation 8(9) for the former Aer Rianta to set parking charges at the State Airports, including Dublin Airport, and from that point on, the Minister of the day had no function in regard to the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_3808">I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 186, 194, 198, 218 and 228 on 5 October 2004. As I indicated in that reply, in line with the Government decision on the review of local and community development structures, proposals had been received from all city and county development boards, CDBs. At that stage, the proposals had been assessed by an external consultant engaged by my Department and I had been able to approve proposals from Fingal CDB for funding. Other CDBs had been asked to take a more focused look at their proposals and resubmit them to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3809">Since that reply, my Department received fresh proposals from most CDBs. These have again been assessed by the external consultant and I am pleased to say that, arising from this process, I have been able to approve funding of €2.9 million for proposals from a wide range of CDBs and from Udarás na Gaeltachta in respect of Gaeltacht areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3810">However, arising from the process, I was unable at this stage to commit funding to proposals received from 12 CDBs, including the county referred to by the Deputy. My Department is making arrangements to meet the directors of community and enterprise from each of these CDBs. I hope that the continuation of this engagement between my Department, the CDBs and the local and community development agencies will lead to the development of proposals for which I can provide funding support.</p>

In addition, costs were incurred in placing advertisements, requesting submissions on the preparation by my Department of a scheme under the Act. In all, these costs have amounted to some €30,000 to date in 2004. These are once-off costs.

Following independent assessment of the proposals received, I have been able to approve funding of €2.9 million for proposals from a wide range of CDBs and from Údarás na Gaeltachta in respect of Gaeltacht areas. Building on the proposals received, I hope to bring further recommendations to Government, which will conclude the review of local and community development structures in the earlier part of next year.

The Commission has promised such clarification for early 2005 and we must wait until then before commencing substantive negotiations on the application of the proposed criteria. It is too early in the negotiating process to say what the outcome will be. However, I can say that my aim will be to secure detailed criteria for designation which will benefit best all our disadvantaged areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_3838">I propose to take Questions Nos. 381 and 394 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3839">In general, the new single payment scheme which will be introduced in Ireland from 1 January 2005, is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid livestock premia and-or arable aid in one or more of those years and who will continue to farm in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3840">However, during the course of EU negotiations, Ireland secured agreement that farmers who take over a holding, by transfer free of charge or by a lease of five or more years at a nominal amount, a holding that was leased out to a third party during the reference period, may apply to the national reserve for payment entitlements under the single payment scheme. This should be of particular benefit to family members who now take over the holdings of farmers who joined the early retirement scheme before the reference period where the land was leased out to a third party during the reference period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3841">Farmers who were in receipt of direct payments during the reference period who have already transferred their holdings by deed of transfer or by lease or who will do so by 15 May 2005, may transfer or lease their entitlements with the land by using a private contract clause in the sales contract or lease agreement. This will ensure that the recipients many of whom are young farmers, will have access to the single payment scheme from 2005 onwards. Further details on use of the private contract clause are available on pages 18 and 19 of the explanatory guide on the single payment scheme which was issued by my Department earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3842">Under the terms of the scheme of early retirement from farming, the participant is required at all times to have his land leased or transferred to an eligible transferee in order to receive payment of pension. I am conscious of the concerns of retired farmers, particularly of those who entered the first scheme of early retirement and whose leases may now be nearing an end. Discussions are taking place with the European Commission in the hope of finding a solution, within the terms of the relevant EU regulations, to situations such as that in which a participant may experience difficulties in finding a replacement transferee. The rental value of land is, however, a matter that must be determined by the market.</p>

            <p eId="para_3919">In general, the new single payment scheme, which will be introduced in Ireland from 1 January 2005, is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid livestock premia and-or arable aid in one or more of those years and who will continue to farm in 2005. However, during the course of EU negotiations, Ireland secured agreement that farmers who take over, by transfer free of charge or by a lease of five or more years at a nominal amount, a holding that was leased out to a third party during the reference period, may apply to the national reserve for payment entitlements under the single payment scheme. This should be of particular benefit to family members who now take over the holdings of farmers who joined the early retirement scheme before the reference period where the land was leased out to a third party during the reference period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3920">Farmers who were in receipt of direct payments during the reference period who have already transferred their holdings by deed of transfer or by lease or who will do so by 15 May 2005, may transfer or lease their entitlements with the land by using a private contract clause in the sales contract or lease agreement. This will ensure that the recipients many of whom are young farmers, will have access to the single payment scheme from 2005 onwards. Further details on use of the private contract clause are available on pages 18 and 19 of the explanatory guide on the single payment scheme, which was issued by my Department earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3921">As regards index-linking of payments, the rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming is the maximum provided for by the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments. My Department's proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which commenced on 27 November 2000 and is one of the measures in the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000 to 2006 included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted on legal grounds that a fixed rate be set instead.</p>

            <p eId="para_3923">Council Regulation EC No. 1782/2003 establishing the single payment scheme introduced an aid of €45 per hectare per year for areas sown under energy crops. The aid is granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and a processor, except in the case of processing undertaken by the farmer on the holding. Agricultural raw materials, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme provided that the crops are intended primarily for use in the production of energy products derived from biofuels or from biomass. In 2004, this energy crop scheme is in addition to the arable aid scheme. In 2005, the aid will be paid in addition to the single payment.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3952">I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 and 400 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3953">The Internet is an international phenomenon. It has no borders and there is no single organisation controlling it. Measures to combat child pornography on the Internet are, therefore, hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems and, indeed, differing societal norms. Furthermore, developments in new communications technologies allow for Internet access from many means other than the traditional personal computer. For the above reasons, combating the production and availability of child pornography requires a combination of responses and the co-operation of all stakeholders at both national and international level — legislators, law enforcement, schools, child protection practitioners and, most importantly, parents and guardians.</p>
            <p eId="para_3954">In terms of legislation, in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, Ireland has already one of the most robust legislative measures anywhere. Under the Act, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography — films, videos or material in written or auditory form, including material produced or transmitted via the Internet — are offences, with penalties of up to 14 years' imprisonment. Mere possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up to five years. Using a child or allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography is also punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3955">The Garda Síochána is committed to the investigation of all cases of child pornography and the importance of investigating the child protection issues involved in such cases. The paedophile investigation unit, which is located within the domestic violence and sexual assault unit of the national bureau of criminal investigation, is in existence since November 2002. This unit is tasked with the investigation and co-ordination of cases relating to the possession, production and distribution of child pornography and any alleged sexual abuse pertaining to same. It also engages in proactive investigation of intelligence concerning paedophiles and their use of technology. There is continuous co-operation and liaison with other police forces in an effort to investigate and combat these crimes. The Garda Síochána has successfully prosecuted a number of cases under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_3956">On the structural side, the Government established a working group in 1997 to examine and report on the question of the illegal and harmful use of the Internet with particular reference to child pornography. The report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet was published in July 1998. The main recommendation of the report was for a system of self regulation by the Internet service provider industry. The components of such a system were to include the following: an Internet advisory board or IAB — established in February 2000 and funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the information society fund — which promotes awareness of Internet downside issues, co-ordinates efforts to combat child pornography on the Internet and monitors the effectiveness of self regulation by the Internet service provider industry; a public hotline for reporting child pornography — established 1999 and funded by the industry; and an industry code of practice setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet service provider — agreed February 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3957">The Internet advisory board oversees and monitors progress on child pornography measures and supervises a self regulatory regime for the Irish Internet service providers. The self regulation approach to Internet regulation has been adopted worldwide and the board helps and supports the Irish Internet service provider industry to deliver an effective self regulation environment, in accordance with an agreed code of practice and ethics for the industry. The Internet advisory board carried out a review of the code of practice and ethics earlier this year and the findings show that the code is still very relevant and also one of the most advanced ISP industry codes in the European Union. The board's brief also extends to general downside issues on the Internet, including general safety for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3958">The hotline —<i>www.hotline.ie</i>— funded by the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Ireland with support from the EU safer Internet action plan, was launched in November 1999 and has been operating since that time. Special protocols operate between the Garda and the hotline which maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3959">The hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of, the international INHOPE Association, <i>www.inhope.org</i>, a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world. The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.</p>
            <p eId="para_3960">International co-operation is a vital part of the fight against child pornography on the Internet and Ireland is fully committed to playing its part. In September 2001, the Council of Europe Ministers' deputies approved the first international convention on cybercrime. Ireland signed up to the convention in June 2002. The main objective of the convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime. The convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the Internet, infringements of copyright, computer related fraud and violations of network security.</p>
            <p eId="para_3961">The European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography on the Internet. Under the safer Internet action plan, the EU is providing financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the Internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children. A new EU action plan — safer Internet plus — covering the period 2005 to 2008, with a budget of €45 million, has been finalised and is expected to be approved at European Council level in December 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3962">The Council also adopted a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography on 22 December 2003. While I have indicated that the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, my Department is considering the question of whether additional legislative provisions are required to give effect to this framework decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_3964">The information requested by the Deputy in respect of Mountjoy Garda station is as follows. The mast at the station was installed in 1985. The following antennae are installed on the mast: five microwave links; six array panels; two AN3U and one CAT 165. The following antennae are in use by the Garda Síochána: two microwave links; two AN3U and one CAT 165. The following antennae were installed in March 1997 by a commercial mobile phone company: three microwave links and six array panels. No emission audits by the Garda Síochána have been carried out on the mast at Mountjoy Garda station.</p>

            <p eId="para_3969">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that on 22 November 2004 an additional four community gardaí were assigned to Fitzgibbon Street Garda station. This brings the number of community gardaí attached to Fitzgibbon Street station to 18 — two sergeants and 16 gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_3970">With regard to Garda resources generally, the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3971">Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_3972">In each of the next three years there will be an intake of almost 1,100 new recruits per year. The advertisement campaign for this first tranche of 1,100 recruits was launched on Thursday, 25 November 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_4008">Under the Refugee Act 1996, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications or appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage. A final decision will be made in this case upon receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</p>

            <p eId="para_4010">In the light of the Government's recent decision to approve my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000, I have taken the opportunity to ask the Garda Commissioner to review the eligibility criteria for entry to the force. This is an opportune time to ensure that the criteria for entry meet the needs of the Garda Síochána and the society it serves.</p>
            <p eId="para_4011">One particular aspect which the Commissioner has already studied is the maximum age of entry to the Garda Síochána. On foot of this, the Government has now approved the Commissioner's proposal to increase the maximum age of entry to the Garda Síochána from 26 years of age to 35 years of age. This is reflected in the recruitment campaign advertised. There are no other changes to the eligibility criteria for entry to the Garda Síochána as far as the current competition is concerned. The educational requirements with regard to the Irish language remain in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_4012">As stated previously, it is right that future intakes of recruits to the Garda Síochána should as far as possible reflect the composition of Irish society and I am anxious to see if there are any possible changes to the existing criteria which might facilitate recruitment from different ethnic backgrounds in our community. With this in mind, I have asked the Commissioner, as part of his overall review of the entry requirements for the Garda Síochána, to examine whether any of the existing eligibility criteria militate, however indirectly, against the recruitment of members from ethnic communities in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4013">One of the eligibility criteria which could benefit from review in this regard is the requirement for entrants to have an educational qualification in Irish but there may be others which could impact on entrants from ethnic communities. Perhaps there may also be issues not specifically related to entry or eligibility but which might equally raise issues for certain communities. I have, therefore, asked the Commissioner to consult appropriately with representatives of the immigrant community in this regard in the context of his review of the eligibility criteria for entry to the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_4014">Whatever new arrangements might be put in place in respect of the Irish language specifically in the future, it will continue to have an important place in the Garda Síochána, and everyone who wishes to must be able to communicate with the force through our native language. In this regard, the Garda Síochána has a strong commitment to delivering a service through Irish. Proficiency in Irish is strongly promoted within the force and that will continue to be the case.</p>

The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner recommended that he should not be declared as a refugee and he was notified of this recommendation on 11 March 2004.

            <p eId="para_4024">I understand that the focus of the Deputy's question is permission to remain in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.</p>
            <p eId="para_4025">There is an ongoing increase in the number of applications of the type referred to by the Deputy. There were 156 in 2001 and 271 in 2003. The number of applications received for residency based on marriage to an Irish national for the year to date to 31 October is 287. Applications of this type are dealt with on a strict chronological basis and are taking approximately 16 months to process. The resources allocated to process such applications are dependent on the prioritised work requirements of the immigration division of my Department at any one time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4026">The Deputy will appreciate that the huge increase in the number of non-nationals present in the State in recent times is reflected in the demand for the services of the immigration and citizenship division. My Department is undergoing a review of the resources available in the immigration and asylum areas with a view to redeploying staff to areas most affected by these delays. It should be noted that all applications are acknowledged at the time of receipt and requests are made for documents when the claim is to be further processed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4028">In April 2003 a crèche-pre school facility was established at the centre in question by the Daughters of Charity, the North Eastern Health Board and the proprietor. The facility caters for three groups of children: a baby group, which is aimed at infants between one and two years of age; a toddler group, which is aimed at children between two and three years of age; and a pre-school, which is aimed at children above three years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_4029">The facility provides services for 109 children. Two sessions operate from Monday to Thursday, while a morning session operates on a Friday. Each child enrolled is entitled to three sessions per week. In September a new room was opened and two additional staff were recruited to cater for the baby group and there are now six members of staff and a manager providing the crèche-pre school service. In addition to the crèche-pre school facility, a homework club is provided for children of primary school age. The club operates between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Thursday and caters for children from the age of six to 12 years. At present, 61 children are enrolled in the club which has 16 staff members who consist, in the main, of volunteers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4030">The Reception and Integration Agency, which is responsible for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers, reviews the services provided at all centres on an ongoing basis with a view to improving them where possible and the further improvement of services at the centre in question will be considered in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_4145">While there are general claims of underreporting of crime, there is no evidence that the level of underreporting now is any greater than in the past or that the proportion of unreported crime in Ireland is any greater than in other jurisdictions. The problems of unreported and unrecorded crime are well documented in the international criminological literature and are in no way unique to this country. Furthermore, the introduction of PULSE has improved the accuracy and comprehensiveness of Garda statistics such as, for example, the system demands that incidents now have to be recorded before particular actions can be taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_4146">Steps are, however, being taken to obtain a more accurate estimate of the level of victimisation in Ireland. Following a recommendation of the National Crime Council, the Government has agreed that crime victimisation surveys should take place. Following the submission to me in July of its report by the expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the Central Statistics Office should take over the carrying out of these surveys. As a result of these surveys, we will have a greater understanding as to why some victims chose not to report cases to the Garda and what we can do with regard to reduce the level of under-reporting.</p>
            <p eId="para_4147">I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are sufficient measures in place to facilitate the reporting of all offences. These measures include 999 emergency calls, phone calls and visits to Garda stations and the availability of gardaí on mobile and beat patrols.</p>
            <p eId="para_4148">With regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, thereby honouring the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4149">The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with significant drugs problems and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.</p>

            <p eId="para_4152">Garda youth diversion projects — formerly Garda special projects — are funded by my Department. They are a crime prevention initiative designed to engage with young people who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community-based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_4153">In June 1991, the Ballymun action youth project was established under the acronym BAY. The community-based committee established a limited company, trading as BAY Limited, to act as a management agency to manage the project. In February 2003, this limited company was wound up and the project closed. The community relations section, in conjunction with local Garda management and in the context of available resources, is currently considering the establishment of a new Garda youth diversion project in the Ballymun area.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_4166">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 308 of 9 November. The position remains unchanged and it is not proposed to allow asylum applicants to take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_4167">There are a number of key reasons I believe that the current policy in respect of access to work by asylum seekers should not be changed. Section 9 (4)(<i>b</i>) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that an applicant for asylum shall not seek or enter employment. It must also be borne in mind that, under the 1996 Act, asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications. However, we must face the fact that, despite its humanitarian purpose, people seek protection under the 1996 Act — which gives effect to the State’s obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention — for the purpose of avoiding legitimate immigration controls to gain a foothold in the State for economic reasons. Similar trends have been experienced by other EU states.</p>
            <p eId="para_4168">I am convinced that any extension of the right to work arrangement would greatly undermine the considerable progress that has been made in respect of asylum processing arising from the Government's asylum strategy which has resulted in more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status. The continued momentum in processing timescales for asylum applications has resulted, for example, in a situation where prioritised applications receive an interview and decision at first instance within six weeks of application and timescales for considering appeals have also been reduced considerably. The number of applications over six months in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal at the end of October 2004 stood at 1,396 as compared to some 6,500 at the end of September 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_4169">Extending the right to work would have a negative impact on asylum numbers, as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so. The immediate effect of that measure was a threefold increase in the average number of applications per month leading to a figure of 1,217 applications in December 1999, compared with an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999. Any significant increase in applications would also have a negative impact on our capacity to accommodate asylum applicants while they are awaiting a determination of their claims. As things stand at the moment, the ongoing provision of services to meet the reception, health, welfare and accommodation needs of asylum seekers is an enormous challenge for all the State agencies who work in this area. The total cost to the Exchequer of the provision of services to asylum seekers was approximately €353 million in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4170">Any proposal to grant asylum seekers access to the labour market would also undermine the current and effective work permit system which provides a comprehensive channel for legal migration to the State. It would further widen the gap in a negative manner in terms of reward between those who access the labour market legally through the work permit and visa channels and those who simply abuse the asylum process to gain entry.</p>
            <p eId="para_4171">It is a well established fact that those engaged in trafficking and those seeking to access the labour market without going through the appropriate legal channels are very quick to identify any perceived attractiveness of a country as a preferred or easily accessed destination. It is clear from the profile of applicants and the results of the determination process that a significant number of people have sought asylum in Ireland with a view to seeking work. Many people are already working illegally. It is my strong belief that any extension of the right to work along the lines proposed by the Deputy would be portrayed abroad by people traffickers to potential victims as a cast iron guarantee of a right to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_4172">I firmly believe that the greatest service we can provide to those who should be recognised as refugees is to ensure that their claims are decided speedily and that nothing is done which undermines this policy priority by attracting large numbers of non-genuine applicants to the detriment of genuine applicants. The structures in place provide the State with an asylum system that meets the highest international standards and fulfils our international obligations under the Geneva Convention to those seeking asylum. Overloading the process with large numbers of new applicants who come here under the misguided expectation that they will be able to work would be totally contrary to these obligations and could completely negate the major investment in effort, time and resources which has gone into bringing our overall strategy to its current status.</p>

            <p eId="para_4174">Following the Supreme Court decision in the case of L&amp;O in January 2003, the separate procedure for considering residency applications based solely on parentage of an Irish-born child ceased on 19 February 2003. As regards outstanding claims to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child, and future claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish-born children, the Government decided that every such case would be examined and decided individually. A notice to this effect was published on 18 July 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4175">The amendment to the Constitution following the June referendum has allowed the Oireachtas to deal with the issue of citizenship for children of non-national parents. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004 is before the House. Until that legislation is enacted and commenced, the situation on the ground will remain unchanged. Any person born in Ireland is still entitled to Irish citizenship. This continues to be an attraction to persons, with no link to Ireland, to seek to come to Ireland to acquire Irish and EU citizenship for their children. In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for any change in procedures to be introduced in advance of the establishment of legislation as envisaged by the recent referendum. I have no plans for dealing with all cases on a collective statutory basis. Each case will be dealt with individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_4176">I indicated at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that I will in the near future make public my approach to the resolution of the issues raised in their cases.

            <p eId="para_4183">Two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for refugee status. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for refugee status at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers appeals from negative recommendations of the commissioner.

Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, requires the Minister to consider 11 factors, including representations received by or on behalf of the person, family and domestic circumstances, employment prospects etc., in deciding whether to make a deportation order or to grant temporary leave to remain in the State.

            <p eId="para_4246">I propose to take Questions Nos. 454, 505 and 506 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4247">The staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The guidelines can only be deviated from where a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. In such cases, an additional post, referred to as a developing school post, may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn. The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputies on 30 September 2003 was 59 pupils, which warrants a staffing of principal plus two mainstream posts for the 2004-05 school year. On the basis of projected enrolments, a developing school post was approved provisionally. However, the required enrolment figure at 30 September 2004 was not achieved and accordingly sanction for the post was withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_4248">To ensure openness in the teacher allocation system at primary level, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The staffing of this school for the 2004-05 school year was considered by the appeals board on 21 October 2004. The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Department circular 19/02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board on 21 October 2004. I am sure the Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board. One hundred and thirty-two additional teaching posts were created as a result of the application of the mainstream staffing schedule for the current school year.</p>

        the improvements undertaken by her in recent years to cater for children in primary schools with autism; and her proposals to enhance these programmes.
        [31076/04]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_769">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4252">Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</p>
            <p eId="para_4253">Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs, including autism, have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes-units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports. My Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many children with such needs, including autism, are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of special resource teachers and-or special needs assistants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4254">Children with more severe disabilities are catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are currently 107 special schools in the country. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio and other staffing supports. For example, each class catering for a maximum of six pupils with autism will have a staffing of at least one teacher and two special needs assistants. Additional special needs assistant support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4255">Where placement in a special school is not considered necessary, children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can attend special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools. All special autism classes enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with autism attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day and, in that way, benefit from being able to socialise with their non-disabled peers. A total of 139 special classes for autism are in place in the primary system at present. Further special classes for autism may be established nation-wide, as appropriate. While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure, if appropriate. The following dedicated resources are now deployed to support children with special educational needs, including those with autism, in the primary system: — more than 2,600 resource teachers — up from 104 in 1998; — more than 1,500 learning support teachers — up from 1,302 in 1998; — more than 1,000 teachers in special schools; — more than 600 teachers in special classes; — more than 5,000 special needs assistants — up from 300 in 1998; — more than €30 million on school transport for special needs pupils; and — more than €3 million towards specialised equipment and materials — up from €0.8 million in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_4256">To appreciate the scale of improvement in the provision of resources to primary schools for special needs, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, at approximately 10,700, the number of adults providing services to children with special educational needs in primary schools today equates to more than half of the 21,100 primary teaching force in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_4257">My Department is continuing to develop the network of special educational provision for children with autism. The extent of progress can be measured from the fact that, since 1998, when autism was first recognised as a distinct special educational need, the number of dedicated facilities that have been developed is as follows: — eight pre-school classes for children with autism; — 134 special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools; — five special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome; and — eight autism facilities, some of which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model, ABA, of response to children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4258">Another major landmark in the development of autism specific services was the joint launch last month by my predecessor and the Minister with responsibility for education in Northern Ireland of the Middletown Centre for Autism. This marked the successful completion of the purchase of the former St. Joseph's Adolescent Centre, Middletown, on behalf of the Department of Education in the North and the Department of Education and Science in the South. Both Departments plan to refurbish the property to meet the needs of a centre of excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
            <p eId="para_4259">Four key services will be provided by the centre: a learning support service on a residential basis; an educational assessment service; a training and advisory service, and; an autism research and information service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4260">I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of services for children with autism. However, I fully recognise that further progress is required and my Department in consultation with parents and existing service providers will seek to ensure that the recent rate of development is maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_4276">The school to which the Deputy refers is currently included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, and Giving Children an Even Break, GCEB. The disadvantaged areas scheme benefits schools by providing additional capitation grants of €38<i>per capita</i>, concessionary teaching posts, a refund of the television licence fee and eligibility for 95% building grants for building projects. Designated disadvantaged schools are included in the home-school community liaison scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4277">Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage and my Department's approach is now refined to ensure that individual "at risk" pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, under this scheme my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_4278">Primary schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in the disadvantage areas scheme retain their existing entitlements. My Department has been engaged in an overall review of its educational disadvantage programmes, with a view to building on what has been achieved to date, adopting a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people. Any decision to expand or extend any of the initiatives aimed at addressing educational disadvantage is being considered in the context of this review, the outcome of which I hope to announce shortly.</p>

The following tables set out the total number of students in receipt of funding under the three third level grant schemes, for the 2000-01 to 2002-03 academic years.</p>

            <p eId="para_4348">The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. However, in regard to PE facilities generally, the position is that many primary schools have a general purposes room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas, which are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. A similar situation applies to sports halls and outdoor facilities at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>

In the context of the available funding for temporary accommodation, and the number of applications for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received. As an interim measure some schools have been advised to maximise the use of existing accommodation until my Department is in a position to make extra accommodation available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4351">The need for additional accommodation at these schools will be considered in the context of a review, which is being undertaken of all projects that did not proceed as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005. My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under investment in school infrastructure. The Government is delivering on its commitment to provide modern facilities in schools and has progressively increased funding in recent years with an aggregate total of almost €2 billion since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4352">In regard to the third level sector, most if not all institutions have facilities for sporting/PE activities. The recent report of the review group on capital projects in the higher education sector, Kelly report, recommends funding in the region of €35 million for development of multi-purpose/PE facilities at nine third level institutions. Many other priority projects identified in the Kelly report and they will all be considered in the context of the overall funding available to me once the multi-annual capital envelope for the education sector is determined in the budget tomorrow.</p>

            <p eId="para_4354">The provision of guidance in third level colleges is a matter for individual colleges and the Higher Education Authority. At second level all schools have an ex-quota teacher allocation for the provision of guidance and counselling. In the case of schools in the free education scheme, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week in the case of schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 44 hours per week, that is two whole-time posts, in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_4355">In addition to allocations based on enrolments, 50 whole-time equivalent guidance counselling posts were allocated in the 2001-02 school year under the guidance enhancement initiative, GEI. The focus of this initiative was to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects. The GEI was recently extended for a further two years and an additional 30 guidance posts were allocated under the initiative from the commencement of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4356">Professional training in guidance and counselling for practitioners in second level schools is provided by a number of universities who offer either a one-year full-time or two-year part-time higher diploma in guidance and counselling as a postgraduate course. A master's degree in education with a specialism in guidance and counselling is available as an alternative route to qualification for second level teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4357">My Department also supports a number of in-service training activities for guidance counsellors in second level schools. In the main, these activities take the form of seminars, conferences and short courses. In consultation with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, my Department is working to ensure that in-career development opportunities for guidance counsellors are structured in a way that will adequately address their needs in the context of the changing environment in which guidance and counselling services are delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4358">The National Centre for Guidance in Education, NCGE, is an agency of my Department whose role is to support and develop guidance in all areas of education, and to inform policy in this field. As part of its remit the NCGE develops guidance materials, provides advice on good practice, supports innovation and pilot projects, disseminates information to practitioners and carries out a range of surveys and related research on guidance practice and needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4359">My predecessor commissioned a review of guidance and counselling in post-primary schools, which is now near completion. I expect to receive the report of the review in January 2005, and the findings will help to inform strategy on the development of guidance in post-primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_4365">I propose to take Questions Nos. 497 and 507 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4366">Funding arrangements for voluntary secondary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system and are structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants for secretarial and caretaking services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4367">There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools including those referred to by the Deputy. The standard <i>per capita </i>grant now amounts to €274 as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. I draw the attention of Deputies to my recent announcement, in the context of the 2005 Estimates, to the further increase in this grant to €286 per pupil, with effect from January next. This increase will bring the <i>per capita </i>grant in the case of disadvantaged schools to €324 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4368">In addition, under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant. This grant which was introduced in September 2000 has been increased from €25 per pupil to the current rate of €99 per pupil, and will be further increased to €103 from January next.</p>
            <p eId="para_4369">Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support grant has in the case of voluntary secondary schools been significantly enhanced to €131 per pupil, and from January next will be further increased by €10 per pupil bringing the overall grant for such schools to €145 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4370">These increases are in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4371">For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional funding of up to €119,000 per annum and annual grants of €255,761, €275,000 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in general a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items, including those referred to by the Deputies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4372">I was particularly pleased to announce an aggregate increase of €26 per pupil from January next for voluntary secondary schools. Schools have welcomed this increase. These significant increases in the funding of secondary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</p>

The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_4377">Similarly, tuition fees under the free fees initiative are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance on a course at the same level.

            <p eId="para_4378">My Department understands that the student referred to by the Deputy already holds an undergraduate degree. Accordingly, she is ineligible for a higher education grant or to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of her current degree course in physiotherapy at UCD.</p>
            <p eId="para_4379">Tax relief, however, is available in respect of undergraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in regard to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_4380">Apart from the funding provided through the student support maintenance grant schemes, financial assistance is also available from my Department through the student assistance fund. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on this fund is available from the student access officer at UCD.</p>

            <p eId="para_4394">The Attorney General is responsible for the nomination and payment of barristers acting on my behalf in proceedings before the courts and the costs associated with the Chief State Solicitor are met by him as well. In a small number of instances it is considered appropriate for me to be advised by counsel and solicitors outside that framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_4395">My Department operates a scheme to meet the costs of solicitors acting on behalf of the parties to the indemnity agreement between certain members of the Conference of the Religious in Ireland and the Government in respect of abuse which occurred in residential institutions. In 2003, €475,281.95 was paid to firms in that regard and in 2004 the figure to date is €936,195.35.</p>
            <p eId="para_4396">On the advice of the Attorney General I make payments directly to barristers who represent the State in the matters relating to the work of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The terms and conditions relating to those appointments are agreed in advance with the Attorney General. In 2003, a total of €990,139.47 and in 2004, €756,516.92 was paid to the barristers comprising the ten highest earning individuals representing my interests at the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The breakdown of those figures is as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_4423">In one instance my Department has relied on independent counsel to assist in the drafting of a statutory instrument, the European Communities (General System for the Recognition of Higher Ed Diplomas and Professional Education and Training and 2nd General System for the Recognition of General Education and Training) (Amendment) Regulations 2003. This was done on the advice of the Attorney General and a payment of €5,700 was made this year in respect of that assistance. On one occasion in 2004 a firm of solicitors was engaged by my Department to provide assistance with a patent matter and they were paid €383.57.</p>
            <p eId="para_4424">A barrister, on the advice of the Attorney General, provided training services directly to my Department in 2004 and a payment of €2,721.92 was made to that person. The totals based on the above figures are €1,465,421.42 for 2003 and €1,701,517.76 for 2004. However in the limited time available for the preparation of this answer it has not been possible to collate figures for the expenditure on counsel for the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse other than the ten highest earners and add those figures to the totals here. The remainder of the information will be prepared and forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_4458">As I stated in response to Question No. 361 of 12 October 2004, the issue of public safety zones at State airports was the subject of a study by consultants which was submitted to the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in September 2003. The recommendations in the report are being considered by the Departments with a view to submitting proposals to the Government. If they are approved by the Government, it is envisaged that public safety zones will be implemented through local development plans. The implementation of the zones, whether by variation of a current development plan or inclusion in a draft plan, would be the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_4468">EU and national policy on waste management is firmly grounded on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy, which prioritises waste prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and the environmentally sound disposal of residual waste which cannot be recycled or recovered. The policy is reflected in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's policy documents, Changing our Ways, which was published in 1998, and Taking Stock, Moving Forward, which was published earlier this year. The publications are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_4469">Ireland is making significant progress towards attaining the targets set in Changing Our Ways. The 2002 interim national waste database report, which was published by the EPA, estimated that 20.7% of municipal — household and commercial — waste was recovered for recycling in 2002. That represents an increase on the 1998 rate of 9%. There are indications that the recycling position has improved further since 2002, following the implementation of the local and regional waste management plans. New packaging regulations introduced last year, requiring the segregation and recycling of specified back door packaging waste by producers, have influenced the increased recycling rates in the commercial sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4470">Other recent significant initiatives include the establishment of a market development group to identify market opportunities for materials recovered for recycling. It is hoped to publish a market development programme in early 2005. The draft national waste prevention programme, drawn up by a core prevention team established earlier this year in the EPA, has been published. A draft national biodegradable waste strategy, setting out a range of integrated measures aimed at providing an effective basis for the achievement of the 2013 biodegradable waste target, was published earlier this year for public consultation. Initiatives have been proposed for end of life vehicles, waste electrical and electronic equipment, newsprint and tyres.</p>
            <p eId="para_4471">International trade in waste is not inconsistent with the Government's policy, which clearly prioritises the prevention, reuse and recycling of waste, rather than its disposal. The OECD's decision on the control of transboundary movement of waste destined for recovery operations notes that the recovery of valuable materials and energy from waste is an integral part of the international economic system and that well established markets exist for and can contribute to the collection and processing of such materials within member countries.</p>

The importance of the architectural heritage of the buildings in which the cafés referred to in the Deputy's question operate is reflected in their inclusion on Dublin City Council's record of protected structures. Under the 2000 Act, planning permission is required for any works that would materially affect the character of the structures or any element of the structures that contributes to their special interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_4492">A separate allocation is not given to local authorities by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the payment of disabled persons grants.

In some cases, however, the sum includes the provision of dedicated election office space in addition to equipment storage. While the voting machines do not require regular maintenance between polls, the equipment contract negotiated with Nedap-Powervote provides for free servicing and repair, where necessary, of all voting equipment until the end of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_4842">The Office of Public Works is carrying out conservation works at the site referred to in the question. Some €27,000 has been spent so far this year. Further work, involving the refurbishment of adjoining houses, was planned by the OPW but it was not pursued because the ownership of the houses has yet to be transferred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Outline plans for the provision of new visitor facilities which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, acquiring and refurbishing the adjoining houses for the purposes of providing access to the site, have been prepared. I am considering the plans in the context of other demands on the Department’s built heritage capital works programme, having regard to the long-term viability of the project. I will be happy to meet with the local group involved in this regard.</p>

Some 1,018 such notices were issued in 2003. Information on the number of notices issued under each section is not available in the Department. Regarding housing legislation, I assume the question refers to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997. Provisional information available to the Department from local authorities indicates that 55 excluding orders were sought by local authorities from the courts under section 3 of that Act in 2003, of which 24 were granted and 17 enforced.</p>

            <p eId="para_4846">The three tax incentive based urban regeneration schemes are the urban and town renewal schemes and the living over the shop scheme. Based on local authority returns, there is evidence that the schemes, which expire on 31 July 2006, have had a significant and beneficial impact throughout the country. It is estimated that total investment under the three schemes will amount to €5.5 billion. I intend to carry out a formal assessment of the full impact of the schemes next year. Pending that assessment and developments at EU level concerning regional aid guidelines for the post-2006 period, firm proposals do not exist for further such urban regeneration schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_4848">The Viking site at Woodstown was discovered during the course of archaeological investigations, in advance of the construction of the N25 Waterford bypass, which were being carried out on behalf of Waterford City Council under the auspices of the National Roads Authority. A report on the outcome of the investigations, which identified a previously unknown Viking site, was submitted to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is available on the NRA website. Further archaeological investigations followed aimed at determining the nature and extent of the archaeological features. The investigations included geophysical surveys outside the CPO line, funded by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4849">The Department issued directions under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004 requiring further studies to be carried out by the road developers to establish the archaeological potential of a marsh area at the western end of the site. These were palaeo-environmental coring to establish the nature and extent of the sediments in this area, archaeo-geophysical prospecting techniques to establish the presence or absence of archaeological features, artefacts etc., and specialised test trenching to establish the archaeological potential of the area. Correspondence was recently received from the NRA enclosing reports on the results of the additional investigations. In accordance with the provisions of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 I will consider the reports and consult the National Museum with a view to issuing further directions under the Act to Waterford City Council in relation to the Viking site.</p>
