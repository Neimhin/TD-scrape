I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent national importance, namely, the need to assist the 52% of children in disadvantaged areas that are not ready for primary school, the 26% of children displaying significant conduct problems before starting school and the need for the Department of Education and Science to support creative new proposals to assist these children.

I call on the Government to defer the implementation of the nitrates directive and to delete table Nos. 10 to 21 from the nitrates regulations in the interest of the protection of water quality and to allow Irish farmers to remain competitive.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent importance, namely, the serious and persistently high unemployment levels in excess of 20% in the town of Carrick-on-Suir, where 890 of the town's population of 5,000 are unemployed, the exacerbation of that situation by the closure of SRAM Ireland with the loss of a further 53 jobs. I ask the Minister to instruct the industrial promotion agencies to prioritise Carrick-on-Suir for job creation and investment, to establish a jobs task force for the town, to outline the number of site visits by the industrial promotion agencies to the town in the last six months and to make a statement on the matter.

Nothing is being done about it and people are dying because of that, which is a disgrace.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I have no difficulty with the proposal. This regulation is simply a recommendation by IFSRA regarding prescribed accountancy bodies. However, the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 is back today which was not intended to be the main business of the day. Is this because of the unravelling of support from the Tánaiste's own backbenchers? Deputy Ned O'Keeffe gave an impassioned speech yesterday attacking the Bill. Others are lining up to do the same, I understand. Is this why we want to bring the Competition (Amendment) Bill to a conclusion today, rather than allowing the new submission, for example, from the Vintners Federation of Ireland, to be read by her backbenchers?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Yesterday we had the publication of the eighth International Monitoring Commission report dealing with the issue of criminality, information gathering and events in the North. There is a significant divergence of opinion between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who said there would be "no fudge, no budge" and the Minister for Foreign Affairs who says this opens the way for negotiation and discussion. Does the Progressive Democrats Party share the Fianna Fáil view in Government that this report clears the way for further discussion and negotiation? Has the IMC report not pointed out clearly that information and intelligence gathering is now being used for political purposes and that those previously involved in paramilitary activities are still involved in criminality north and south of the Border?Will we have a real discussion about this to determine the Government's view and does the Tánaiste as the leader of the Progressive Democrats Party share the view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who says the report clears the way for discussions when her own Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said "no fudge, no budge" without a complete end to criminality? What are we at? He has all the files. He sees what he sees and he knows what he knows.When will the Martin report into indiscipline in schools be published? This has been with the Minister for Education and Science for some time.When is the pharmacy Bill, No. 58 on the list of promised legislation, likely to be published? In that context will the Tánaiste indicate whether her Department has appointed a chief pharmacist yet and, if not, what is the reason for the delay? Given that €45 million has been spent on the preparation of site works and buildings for the move from Temple Street to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital site, is this a Government policy matter as contained in the national development programme and reiterated by the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and three other Ministers or has it been shoved over to the Health Service Executive to make what is essentially a policy decision? When is that matter likely to be cleared up?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	33	As regards the proposed development at the Mater site, there is no question of any money being wasted on a new hospital. It is essential for the Mater, as one of the country's oldest hospitals. There are four hospitals in Dublin from which tertiary paediatric facilities are supplied to children from throughout the country. I do not believe there is any other place in the world with a similar population that has tertiary facilities spread across four sites. In the context of the future health care of children, clearly, the right decision must be made. There was a proposal for a new hospital——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It is not late in the day. What was proposed was a new hospital for Crumlin costing €400 million and one for Temple Street, which would cost another €200 million. It might well be that we can get the right answer for much less. The HSE, with my approval, commissioned a consultancy report which it received yesterday. It is being discussed this morning at the HSE board meeting. I will be briefed later this evening and it will be published tomorrow.There are to be two pharmacy Bills. One will deal with fitness to practise issues, which are important. The other will deal with services, physical premises and such issues, and that will be later in the year. We hope to have the first Bill in the first half of this year. As for the chief pharmacist, the former incumbent is working in the Department of Health and Children at present on a consultancy basis.The Minister for Education and Science has told me she received the Martin report in January. She is studying it and intends to publish it within a few weeks.As for the IMC report, there are clearly issues surrounding criminality. One hopes that by the time of the next report substantial progress will have been made in this regard. There is no role in a parliamentary democratic system for those involved in criminal activity.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I know the Tánaiste has her hands full trying to clean up the mess left by her predecessor, surely the most useless Minister for Health since 1922. However, has she found time or the opportunity to find out whether the Minister for Transport was on a frolic of his own last weekend or is there any basis in reality for the announcements he made? Given that she represents the area, has she had time to find out whether all the travel has gone to his head, or what is wrong with him?

Every day there is a new piece of anonymous literature concerning matters that are allegedly taking place in that organisation. I have been in correspondence for more than a year with the Minister over his reappointment of a director who was disqualified from acting as a director of his own company for serious reasons. Despite this, the Minister reappointed him. I believe the Minister might have some contact with one of the trainers who is involved in the doping incident.

I do not have such an animal anyway. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, says he does not even have one as a pet.The Minister has appointed Mr. Tim Dalton, the former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand he will conduct a full inquiry into all the matters. I am sure the Minister will publish the terms of reference.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	There is probably more interest in the House in promised Ministers than promised legislation. Will there be an announcement of ministerial positions before the weekend or will it be later? If it is intended to discuss the Roads (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, will there be a new Minister for Transport given that there appears to be a rebellion in Fianna Fáil over the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the M50? I note that the Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt, is boycotting the House today in protest.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Has the Roads (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was promised in 2004 been abandoned and has it been replaced by an off the top of one's head roads plan? Will the building societies amendment Bill be introduced soon given that it was promised for this session in January 2004? There is a need to examine regulation in the financial institutions sector and that Bill would give us an opportunity to debate it. Will the freedom of information legislation, which has been amended by the Government, be subject to further amendment given the difficulty people have getting information from Teagasc, for example, about scientific advice? Is there a need to amend that legislation or is the Government simply not giving out the information for spite?

The roads Bill will be published this year, the building societies Bill will be published this session and there are no plans, to the best of my knowledge, to amend the freedom of information legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19317	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I am sure the Tánaiste, like other Members, received the interesting document, A Challenge for Policy and Partnership, from the NESC in her post today. The current partnership agreement was not debated in the House either before or after it was negotiated and was never sanctioned by the Dáil. The Government is the only party to the partnership process that feels the need to get sanction for the agreements it enters into on behalf of the taxpayer. Does the Tánaiste intend to change how this is done so the Oireachtas would have a meaningful role and a serious input with regard to the crucial decisions that are taken at the partnership table?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	68	It is always good if these issues are discussed in the House. That can happen on this occasion if there is agreement.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19317	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	It did not happen on the last occasion even though I raised it several times.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Many aspects of the agreement come before the House for discussion. The Deputy should raise the matter with the Whips. My view is that it would be good to have a debate on the partnership agreement in the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19317	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The Government decides what we do in this House. It is not a matter for us to approach the Whips. If the Tánaiste has a view that there should be a role for the Oireachtas, let her say as much and amplify on what that role should be. Let us have serious discussion about the big challenges that face us in the future.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Members will be aware that Marie Therese O'Loughlin is still outside the Dáil. I attempted to raise her case again on the Adjournment but I was told by the Ceann Comhairle's office that I cannot do so because I raised it in December. Will the Tánaiste discuss this issue again with her colleague, the Minister for Education and Science? I was told when I originally raised this case that the home had not been inspected and, therefore, could not be included in the Schedule. The Department of Health and Children has told me that the hostel of which the mother and baby home was a part was inspected by the State and that this information was given to the Department of Education and Science. I cannot find any other means of raising this case because I cannot do so again on the Adjournment. Will the two Ministers consider this issue again?We are told now that it cannot be included in the scheme because it is a hostel but we were originally told it could not be included because it was not inspected. However, it was inspected. There are two separate places, the mother and baby home and the hostel. This is an important issue and Marie Therese is still outside the Dáil. It would not require legislation. I understand the Minister for Education and Science will give the board an extra two years to allow it to do its work. This matter would just require an addition to the Schedule. It must be properly addressed but I cannot find another means of doing so.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I dealt with this matter previously. As the Minister for Education and Science has made clear, hostels are not covered by the legislation.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	That is not the reason we were given originally.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I am aware that Marie Therese O'Loughlin was also in another institution which is covered by the legislation but no abuse took place in that institution. That is the real issue. We cannot extend the redress scheme to hostels and other such places, even for one case. It would be a major——

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the National Oil Reserves Agency or NORA Bill have been promised for some time, as have a number of other Bills relating to energy. In view of the necessity to bring clarity to the legislation and to future planning for the delivery of oil and gas, will the Tánaiste indicate when the Bills will be circulated?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Bills are to be published in this session. That information was given to the Deputy yesterday.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	That is as broad as the Galway racecourse.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I wish to ask about the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland Bill. It appears from the list that the heads of the legislation are not yet agreed. When will that legislation be ready? We are awaiting definite policy decisions relating to TG4, digital broadcasting and the issuing of licences. A number of crucial decisions have been taken in broadcasting even though the legislation is not yet even agreed by the Cabinet.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	83	It will be ready this year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Tánaiste generally speaks with greater clarity than the Taoiseach. As she is in command of the ship of State today, I have a number of questions. Before Christmas the Attorney General advised the Government that random breath testing was unconstitutional. Subsequently, the Taoiseach said everything was constitutional and legal. Yesterday he gave a reply which one would require a PhD. in advanced English to decipher. Based on the advice the Government was given before Christmas and the current position, are the gardaí entitled to conduct random breath testing or can it happen only after legislation has been passed? There is great confusion about this.The Attorney General also advised the Government in respect of the Minister, Deputy Roche's, emergence from the Wicklow hills to take on Sellafield and have it closed down. He advised that the Minister should bring this to the United Nations. The European Court has said the Irish Government was wrong and the Minister, Deputy Roche, now intends to take the European Commission to court. What is the Government's strategy for doing that and is there a timescale for the Minister to take on the European Commission on an issue of such great importance? Why did the advice of the Attorney General not stand up in these two cases? He advised going to the United Nations with the Sellafield issue but the European Court said he was wrong.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Attorney General did not suggest that random breath testing was unconstitutional. His advice was that there were constitutional issues and it had to be dealt with in a certain way. Legislation is necessary. Of course, gardaí are free to establish checkpoints where they believe they are appropriate, but the Attorney General has advised that to ensure clarity and certainty, new legislation would be required to introduce random breath testing for drink driving. A Cabinet sub-committee met this morning to discuss this issue and the Minister, Deputy Cullen, intends to introduce the legislation before the summer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Can we not have breath testing without the legislation?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Not on a widespread scale.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	88	What about Sellafield? When are we to see the great white hope take on the Commission?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	In all these situations the Government will always follow the advice of the Attorney General. On the specifics of Sellafield, I suggest the Deputy should table a question to the relevant Minister.The problem with breath testing is the need to remove the requirement for a garda to form an opinion in order to have testing on a widescale basis. That is what will be provided for in the new legislation.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The nitrates directive will have a severe and damaging impact on agriculture and as a result of the directive there is a plan to jail some farmers who care for the land. Farmers have been custodians of the land for generations and have farmed and protected it. Families have fought over land and farmers have worked hard to maintain its condition. The Government has signed off on something that will see farmers jailed for minding their land.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Has the Deputy a question on the Order of Business?
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Is there any chance the Government will renegotiate this? Our farmers and the agriculture industry are up in arms on the issue but nobody is listening to them. Is there any possibility some parts of the directive could be renegotiated?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	93	They had a good deal in 2001 and would not take it. They should have taken the deal when they got the opportunity.

There are severe consequences to this directive and I ask the Tánaiste to raise the issue at Cabinet to see if something can be done about it.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	100	This is an EU directive and we are in breach of it. As the Deputy is aware, there has been a European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland on this matter. The regulation that was signed on 11 December has been suspended for the moment, pending a review by Teagasc of the science on which it based the advice and about which there is some confusion. I believe there is a five-week——

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	105	On the Corrib gas field, the Government spent €1 million just to watch a peaceful protest. What is the sense of that? I would like legislation to deal with this matter. The Minister has been interfering with the mediation process and has totally redefined what mediation is about. The Rossport five have pulled out of mediation because what the Minister proposes is completely different. He has interfered with the process and utterly screwed up the situation. He must answer on that.Regarding traceability, legislation was introduced when extended hours were introduced for pubs in 2000. Section 17 provided that anyone who provides alcohol should have a barcode or some code of origin on it. Why has that not happened?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	106	We cannot deal with the various sections now.

The Government has been messing about on this matter for years. It held a forum and established a working group, but it has not reported. However, in my area Ms Mineke Kamper is still practising and killing people. She has killed two people due to her negligence.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	201	As I was saying yesterday, I believe stronger enforcement measures need to be included in the Bill to enable the Competition Authority to engage in more criminal prosecutions in the types of cases in question. It is extremely difficult for a supplier to take a case itself because it would naturally upset its relations with retailers. This is a very serious problem.The consumer strategy group has said there is a very strong need to radicalise the consumer. That is pushing an open door because every consumer is naturally sceptical about prices and fears being ripped off. It is easy enough to feed into this fear, if not to abuse it. The Hobbs factor over the summer was an example of this. It was a penalty kick and showed that some prices were higher than others, thus trying to prove there is a general pattern by considering specific examples. This is entirely unscientific and normally belongs in the realm of light entertainment rather than in the realm of public discourse, yet it managed to grab the attention of the nation. Having said that, I feel Eddie Hobbs was unfairly vilified at the time by a particular magazine. Nothing has come of the various allegations that were made against him and I do not expect anything will.We failed to make the point that wages in Ireland have galloped ahead of price increases over the past seven or eight years. Examples of consumers being ripped off can be found but they do not point to a general pattern. Ultimately, the market will correct any imbalances. The example of alcohol is used widely but the inflation of alcohol prices in the rest of the European Union is far in advance of that in the Irish market. This proves there is no general pattern of being ripped off. We have a very open economy and naturally we will import inflation. Energy prices serve as a classic example. All energy prices are increasing and consequently people are noting increases in their electricity and gas bills. This is a consequence of our living in an open economy. Being in an open economy has many benefits but there are also downsides.The Government has done much to try deal with the issue of increasing prices. The one issue that stood out for me during the last general election campaign was that of insurance costs. Many young people raised it with me and other Deputies. We have tackled it and prices have decreased to 1998 levels in some cases. This is to the credit of the Government. A consumer regulator is proposed to try improve consumer knowledge and this is to be welcomed. The general success of the economy ensures people can afford to pay for products. The fact that wage increases are ahead of price inflation proves this. The best comparison with other European countries can be made using the harmonised consumer price index. On utilising this measure one will note that Ireland matches the EU norm in terms of price increases. This is also to the credit of the Government.The Bill should provide for stronger enforcement and investigative powers. Some mechanism should be created to make it easier for a supplier to take a case against a retailer. Perhaps an anonymity clause should be stitched into the Bill so a protest or allegation could be made at an early stage without one having to reveal the source of one's information.We need to take advantage of technology in controlling prices. It was suggested that there should be an Internet portal for comparing prices, particularly in the grocery sector. We need to specify in the Bill bans on certain activities for which suppliers are called on to pay. I have been informed of examples of suppliers being expected to pay for golf outings, putting products on shelves, foreign study tours and promotion. Those practices, if they are found to exist, should be specified and banned in the Bill. I hope amendments can be made in that regard. I support the Bill.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	202	In general, I welcome the Bill. I am happy the issue of below cost selling is being dealt with in the context of competition legislation, which is the proper context. Below cost selling, which was outlawed by the groceries order for many years, beginning in 1956, is not of itself wrong and should not be made illegal, which happened under the 1956 and 1986 orders. However, below cost selling with the specific intention of using one's relative economic strength to drive a competitor out of business in a sustained and targeted way is wrong and anti-competitive. It should be made illegal, but this should be done in the context of competition legislation, not in terms of price fixing legislation or regulations.Price fixing regulation is not the appropriate method in this regard. It is an anachronism in 2006, and more reminiscent of the type of Government controls which operated in the eastern European economies after the Second World War, when people bought their food with coupons and vouchers at fixed prices, regulated by their governments. Ireland has an open, dynamic and modern economy and that sort of price fixing through Government regulation, for whatever noble reason, is an old-fashioned way of trying to influence the market.Before discussing the detailed provisions of the Bill, I welcome the process which has brought us to this stage. It was correct for the Minister to set up an intensive public consultation process, bring all the players into the decision-making process and let all have an opportunity to make their case. The submissions made to the Department were detailed, complex and well researched, and the process provided the proper basis on which to bring this type of legislation forward. For that reason, I very much support it.Given that we have decided the groceries order and price fixing regulations or legislation are not appropriate, we must decide whether competition legislation, existing and proposed, is the appropriate way of dealing with this matter. Whether competition legislation is sufficient and robust enough to deal with the acknowledged fears of the small retailers is what today's debate should be about. We must ask several key questions. What is the nature of the competition? Who is competing against whom? In what market are they competing? There are simplistic notions that once price fixing and below cost selling regulations are eliminated, the multiples will immediately begin a massive price slashing spree in an attempt to take out every small retailer and corner shop in the country. That is an utterly simplistic way to look at the complex market which constitutes retailing in 2006.We must consider the question of who is competing against whom. It is certain that the multiples compete against each other. Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Aldi, Lidl and Spar are in a massive competitive market all of their own, leaving aside any small shop retailer or member of RGDATA. To introduce the possibility of below cost selling in that market would be a fabulous proposition because the consumer will be the ultimate winner and none of the players in that market will be driven out of business. There is also massive competition in the small retail market. Small retailers and corner shops compete against one another, which is right and proper.There is competition at national and local level but we must remember that price competition is not the only type of competition, as has been suggested. Many other forms of competition exist, such as location competition. Given that Brown Thomas has a state-of-the-art shop on Grafton Street offering non-competitive prices, there would be no point in a competitor setting up in Navan, with all due respect to Navan, offering the same product at half the price. Nobody would buy its products and it would go out of business. There is also competition in the way service is provided, in regard to the diversity of the products provided and, importantly, there is serious competition with regard to the convenience of the consumer, leaving aside the aspect of price.Many retailers express the fear, which I acknowledge, that the Bill will result in a sustained period of anti-competitive pricing by the national multiples against small retailers throughout the country. I am not convinced by this argument. While researching this matter, I was much taken by the 1999 report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group. Having carried out an exhaustive analysis of the market, the report stated the group concluded it was extremely unlikely that a firm with a market share of the larger Irish grocery multiples could mount a successful campaign of predation, at least on a national level. The fears of small local shops are unfounded in respect of a price war by the national multiples. However, if such a war was resulted, we would have to consider it.We must take account of the well-founded advice of the Competition and Mergers Review Group. Having said that, it expresses no concern at national level. My concern and my main focus is anti-competitive practices at local level. My constituency contains a good example of these practices. A huge multiple outlet, Dunnes Stores, competes with a corner shop just 10 yards from it. In that microcosm of the market, there is no doubt that Dunnes Stores is in a dominant position, notwithstanding its share of the national market. In a sustained way, I have no doubt that it has the financial muscle to take out its competitor. Across every range of product, it could slash its prices, put the competitor out of business and then raise its prices. We must ensure competition legislation guards against such practices, but I am not convinced it does. This is the question we must address and be satisfied with before we complete this legislation.There are two ways of approaching the issue. The aggrieved party — the small corner shop — could take its case to court. However, we all acknowledge that difficulties arise with regard to compiling economic evidence, notwithstanding the cost and the possibility the shop is fighting a price war. I acknowledge it is difficult for local shops to fight multiples in a legal way. The best way to approach this issue is to give vastly increased powers of policing, protection and enforcement to the Competition Authority. While I acknowledge some resources have been made available to the authority, I strongly suggest these are not enough. The Minister should consider giving the authority vastly increased powers to ensure it polices this area.The Minister and his Department have a major role in this regard. They should police the Competition Authority and question it as to what is has done to police various areas, whether it has compared prices, how many complaints have been made, what it has done to follow up those complaints and whether the authority has compiled evidence to bring a case to court. One of the best ways to avoid competition like that which occurred between the multiple and the small corner shop 100 yards up the road from my home, which could occur in towns in my area like Nenagh, Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West, is to ensure that if multiples slash prices across a range of products, they do so in all their stores. This makes it much less economically viable for a multiple to engage in sustained predatory pricing to the detriment of small outlets. Such a change would also benefit the consumer. I ask the Minister to examine this proposition closely. If multiples engage in below-cost selling, which will now be legal, they should be forced to apply it in all their stores to prevent them from taking out small retailers in the manner I have previously described. However, in general, I welcome the fact that the Government proposes to introduce competition legislation which deals with price fixing rather than mere price-fixing regulations. I commend the Bill to the House.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about this Bill. I am very concerned about the impact of this legislation on consumer prices. The submissions upon which the Minister chiefly relied to make his proposed changes to the competition legislation came from the Competition Authority and the consumer strategy group. The consumer strategy group argued that if the Minister revoked the groceries order and made the necessary changes to the Competition Act 2002, it would result in a 9% reduction in prices almost immediately. A few months later, the chairperson of the consumer strategy group decided that this figure might be too high, indicated that a figure of 3% might be more accurate and argued that such a figure might be achieved within 12 months.Dr. John Fingleton, the former chairperson of the Competition Authority, stated that €500 million would be put back into consumers' pockets if the groceries order was revoked. This is an amazing figure. If this Bill is the Government's answer to Eddie Hobbs, we can look forward to new episodes of "Rip-Off Republic" for every year that this Government remains in office. The Government has done almost nothing to improve the lot of Irish consumers. It has presided over an appalling lack of competition in every area: energy, insurance, transport and communications. It was not until the momentum behind Fine Gael's Rip-Off Ireland campaign helped to spawn public outcry and a television series that the Government decided it needed to give the impression that it cared about consumer rights. Nothing could be further from the truth as the present Administration is responsible for no fewer than 41 stealth taxes in the past three and a half years.This Bill is short in terms of words and benefits to consumers. The Minister can be assured that because of Fine Gael's total opposition to predatory pricing and market dominance, it will not support the Bill in its current form. It has become clear to him from the debate that many of his Fianna Fáil colleagues on the backbenches support what we have stated. In addition, the suppliers of indigenous Irish produce to particular multiplies and retailers will be forced to outsource to remain competitive. The consequent reduction in employment in the food sector is a worrying feature for many people. What consequences will this have on employment in areas across the country such as Mitchelstown, Charleville, Tipperary, Wexford and Kilkenny which produce milk, beef and other agricultural products? These potential consequences have not been debated or even touched upon in this debate. Given that agriculture is declining, there must be considerable anxiety in the food production industry. We have not addressed the consequences of the Bill for this industry.Fine Gael believes that we cannot accept the Bill as it stands because it weakens a number of key protections for consumers and relaxes certain regulations dealing with the relationship between suppliers and the major multiples, with no benefit to the consumer. My party has no difficulty with reviewing the groceries order given that it has been in place for 17 or 18 years, but some provisions of the groceries order, which were of considerable assistance in achieving a level playing pitch, should have been included in this Bill. Fine Gael wanted to see rebates and discounts and a guarantee that they will be passed on to consumers. This all-important provision should be the major plank of this Bill, but there is nothing in it to suggest this will happen.Fine Gael believes, and has consistently stated, that the groceries order should be replaced with a new law such as this legislation which would take account of the necessary changes to the Competition Act and modern trends in the grocery trade. The new law, when enacted, should protect our communities from predatory pricing by multiples and ensure we have choice and diversity in the food sector where multiples and local shops can compete on a level playing pitch. This is where the real concern lies. The local shops found in every village and community across the country are concerned about the abolition of the groceries order. These people provided credit when people could not afford goods or did not possess credit or laser cards when the country was less well-off and people needed to feed their families. Local grocers and local shops maintained and protected those families. These people sponsor local credit unions and GAA, rugby and camogie clubs. I am concerned for their future. They employ students in the summer, work long hours, and contribute significantly to our communities. We are not addressing the needs of these people, who have been burdened with a considerable amount of stealth taxes by the Government.Ireland is crying out for change in the context of competition. Some 41 new stealth taxes have been imposed on everything from energy to stamps. We have suffered a drop of 22 places in our international competitiveness ranking. Dublin is now a more expensive city than Paris and Ireland is one of the most expensive countries in Europe. Some nights ago on the news we saw that Dublin is now a more expensive place to live than New York. That represents Government action in terms of imposing additional charges and taxes in order to make the country uncompetitive. Government inaction on the consumer agenda is undoubtedly part of the reason we are in this grave mess. However, if we really want to tackle the root cause of our high cost base — that feature will be more vital in the years ahead — it is time to take on the anti-competitive behaviour and rid this country, once and for all, of the cartels and agreements that work against the consumer interest. The Minister has set out his objectives to do that, but he is doing the opposite.The Bill fails to do it in this case. Not surprisingly, it has all the hallmarks of having been hastily drafted and presented, and there are many flaws in it. The abolition of the groceries order and the introduction of these changes are clearly meant to take the heat off the Government for its inaction towards Irish consumers over a long period. Faced with the ever increasing costs, particularly those in the State sector, and in the context of considerable consumer concern about being ripped off, this administration has demonstrated inaction and neglect in terms of the plight of consumers. Aside from direct increases in costs of goods and services within the State, the Government has consistently failed to give consumers the benefit of competition in key sectors. Instead of truly taking a positive and pro-consumer stance on consumer issues, all we have had is lip service.For example, we have a new national consumer agency, which has been presented as the saviour for Irish consumers, but it has very little power. All I have seen in recent times has been the spending of plenty of money on soft public relations initiatives. This is to present the agency as being on the side of the consumer. Few who have witnessed the activities of the national consumer agency since its establishment on an interim basis would be inspired with confidence that it will be the saviour of Irish consumers.In particular, it has failed to give any indication of the areas it intends to tackle on behalf of consumers. It seems to be considering many areas. That is hardly surprising, given that the Consumers' Association of Ireland was ignored when the members of the agency were being appointed.The Competition Authority's record in the area of enforcement has been dire. There is no evidence that it has successfully deconstructed any cartels in the economy, or taken on any hard cases in a manner that has benefitted consumers. The authority's approach to the financial services industry, which resulted in a weak and mealy-mouthed report, can be contrasted with the work of the National Consumer Council in Northern Ireland, where a hard-hitting and focused report had the banks in that jurisdiction in a state of crisis as they sought to stave off an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading.It is clear the authority is not operating as an effective body. It does not have a chairman and there is no sign of a new chairman being appointed. There are vacancies in key areas of its membership. For example, the head of its anti-cartel division left that position some months ago. The Minister is relying on some of his officials to ensure the authority has a quorum to do its business.This Government does not seem to care about the poor performance of the Competition Authority and the impact this is having on consumers and businesses. He seems content to allow the authority to perform at a low level. By giving it new powers in this legislation, the Minister is placing his faith firmly behind the authority. He has shown his hallmark unwillingness to take measures beyond those contained in the manila covered brief handed to him by his officials. Fine Gael has published some constructive policy proposals which will make the Competition Authority more resourceful and effective. I request that the Minister examine our well thought out proposals on Committee Stage.The Minister's approach to competition policy is illustrated by the provisions of the legislation we are debating, which has been presented on foot of a consultation process on the future of the groceries order. I have mentioned some of the problems I have with the Minister's report and his subsequent legislation. It is interesting to review the manner in which some of the submissions which were received by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been presented in the Department's report. It is clear from the report that the Department decided to remove the groceries order before it received any submissions on the matter. Having read the report, I must express strong concern about a policy decision being taken on the basis of one side of an argument.There is particular concern about the legislation presented on the basis of what it states about predatory pricing. This is the nub of the matter and an important aspect of the legislation. The Minister has consistently stated that existing competition law is sufficiently robust and appropriate to deal with the issue of predatory pricing. I presume he has a legal opinion from the Attorney General, who changes his mind regularly and has done so on several occasions.Protecting the consumer is uppermost in any legislation moved in the House. The people in the smaller shops in country towns throughout Ireland who have given a service are those who are most concerned about this matter. Various people in the food and drinks industry have made submissions, and the debate has been long with many views taken on board. The multiples and bigger stores are emerging the winners all the time, however. I implore the Minister and the Government, in examining the Bill, to consider favourably the people who have given a service to our communities throughout the country.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I have been listening to the debate and the contributions from Deputies on all sides of the House. There is a broad welcome for the provisions in the Bill. I have strong views in that I would have supported the retention of the groceries order. This is not necessarily because the order, as it was, functioned perfectly, but I felt it should have been retained until such a time that we had legislation indicating what would occur after the order's abolition.I was concerned about the revoking of the order because the Irish retail market has changed substantially in recent years. There have been large changes, with multiples coming in and own brand products being sold on their shelves, and the investment being made in the small retail shops around the country should be protected. In any part of rural Ireland one can see small retail units being developed and forecourts being built, which is a positive development. We should encourage and foster such action to ensure local economies remain vibrant. That is a positive development and something we should foster to ensure that local economies remain vibrant, so that people have access to butchers' shops and petrol and so that money made locally is spent locally. Notwithstanding rural development policies and decentralisation, we should encourage the small shops that exist in almost every village and town, in which their owners have invested substantially in recent years. I was concerned that the abolition of the groceries order would have a negative impact on them, but the legislation as published gives me comfort in that regard.It is an accepted fact that multiples have abused their position in the retail market for many years. The Competition Authority, whether it was unable to do so because of a lack of legislative back-up or some other reason, has failed to stop that. The use of hello money and advertising budgets to sell below the net invoice price has been widely known to have taken place in the retail sector for many years and nothing was done to address it. The multiples will say they were operating within the law and were passing on price cuts to consumers but that is not true. Below net invoice pricing was not allowed under the groceries order, but advertising budgets and hello money contributed to their profits and could not be passed on to consumers. The Competition Authority did not explore this abuse of position. The legislation will work if the Competition Authority is given teeth and has the resources to allow it investigate any abuses that may occur.The changes that have taken place in the retail sector are amazing. In recent years we have seen 24-hour shopping, large multiples and huge investment across the country. That has happened against the backdrop of an increasing population and our new-found prosperity. The range of products available to the consumer has also increased substantially.One area of concern which I do not know how to address is the way multiples give their own brand products preferential treatment on the shelves. That could stymie innovation and the development of small, indigenous, cottage-style companies, such as those producing yoghurt or cheese. Own brand products are more profitable to multiples than providing shelf space for other products. I know of cases where dominant shelf space is provided for a multiple's own brand and other products are relegated to the back of the store or less accessible places, which has an impact on businesses' ability to access the market. I do not know whether to address this by legislation or by empowering the Competition Authority.There is a cap on the size of supermarkets. As we and our infrastructure develops I am concerned that large multiples will become involved in selling petrol, insurance and almost everything else, and that by stealth we will have the hypermarkets that have caused problems in France and elsewhere. People will drive large distances to hypermarkets, taking money out of the local economy and preventing further development and investment in retail in rural Ireland. Instead of doing a weekly shop people travel large distances to do a fortnightly or monthly shop, spending large amounts of money in the process. That might sound like a great idea in the short term, in that it might provide competition and cheaper products to the consumer, but in the long term, as in other countries, the local economy suffers retail closures and suddenly there is a vacuuming of money into certain multiples.Let us be under no illusions, the multiples are not here to service the community but to make a profit. There is nothing wrong with that but we have a duty to ensure the retail sector is regulated to foster competition and protect a very important part of Irish social fabric, namely the small corner shop or little forecourt in the villages and towns throughout rural Ireland.The Minister made reference to the existence of ghost towns in Britain because there is no groceries order. Some would agree with the Minister but others would say he was factually incorrect. In my experience of driving through France I have noticed that, in many areas, the small shops and bakeries that were traditional in that country have gone to the wall in recent years. In some villages in the southern part of France one can travel for miles without finding a shop where one can buy the weekly household provisions. We should be conscious of that and keep an eye on the position here.The consultation process undertaken prior to the Minister making the decision to revoke the restrictive practices order was broadly based and wide-ranging. The main players, however, had made their mind up prior to the process even beginning. The outcome would probably have been the same but it did not give the process the credibility it deserved. The process should have invited submissions but it was regrettable that the major players commented prior to it commencing. People who genuinely believe the groceries order should be retained, not for profit motives alone but for the protection of the small shop and forecourt, felt involved in a process where the decision had already been made. We should address that if we initiate a consultation process in the future.The technical detail of the Bill is straightforward. Its purpose is to deal with anti-competitive practices such as predatory pricing. Another important part of the Bill addresses the dominant position of multiples, not just nationally but locally. Even in a population of 4 million it is important to regionalise markets and examine dominant positions within local areas. Below cost selling, as referred to by many Deputies, happens for many reasons. For example, a trader might advertise a price cut to get publicity in a newspaper and suddenly customers will come into the shop. Predatory pricing, however, to kill off competition also exists and it remains to be seen if the Competition Authority has the ability to deal with this under the legislation.I wish to address the long-term prospects of the Competition Authority. The authority did not have the stomach to take on certain institutions over the years. Reference was made to financial institutions and reports and anecdotal evidence suggest that for years there has existed some form of monopoly. I do not know at what level it operated but I learn from people in the banking industry that the two main players, the AIB and the Bank of Ireland, were involved in a false war of competition, whereby they put on kid gloves and appeared to the public to be boxing with each other. Behind it, however, there was no effort whatsoever to engage in healthy competition for the benefit of the consumer. Only in recent times, since Bank of Scotland Ireland and others have entered the market, have we seen the beginning of genuine competition in the financial sector. The Competition Authority failed to address that. It chased a few farmers around County Louth and elsewhere, yet huge financial institutions were not forced to engage in any form of competition because a corporate gentleman's agreement was reached between the two major players not to undermine each other in a manner that would be healthy for consumers.There have been references to Dunnes Stores, Aldi and Tesco, all of which are welcome. A greater concentration of multiples may develop as the market grows and companies such as Wal-Mart are looking around. The current cap on retail space has been a positive development and should not be removed. Any question raised with regard to its retention deserves a focused debate because, while the Ikea development was sanctioned, we could face a dangerous route of hyperstores and large multinationals which would bring short-term gain to consumers but long-term pain to local economies.The general thrust of the Bill has been widely welcomed, although some in the Opposition do not share that sentiment. I am not sure whether the latter are for the retention of the groceries order as it was, the Competition (Amendment) Bill as it stands or some objective in between. As someone who supported the intention behind the groceries order, I think it failed in certain areas, particularly in terms of advertising budgets, hello money and the fact that net invoice prices were not passed on to consumers.If we are to ensure a healthy and vibrant retail market, we cannot simply pass legislation and hand it over to the Competition Authority but should monitor events on a continuous basis. A mechanism should be developed within the Department to keep an eye on trends in the retail sector and to ensure that the aims of this Bill are achieved on the ground. If, due to a lack of resources or legislative support, the Competition Authority does not have the ability to address problems such as predatory pricing, we could then immediately resolve these issues.Agencies like the Competition Authority should be accountable to this House and should be obliged to appear before committees on a regular basis. By making these matters a reality for the politicians who enter the Dáil to pass legislation, such an obligation would represent a positive development. Statutory provision could also be made that agencies make reports available to Oireachtas committees on a frequent basis. Over the years, the Competition Authority appeared before various committees, during which time the issue of banks and financial institutions were to the fore in terms of public representation.RGDATA had significant concerns on the removal of the groceries order but has given a guarded welcome to the legislation. I hope and trust the aims of this Bill will be met. In the event of the authority's inability do deal with anti-competitive practices, we should be expeditious in addressing the issues, even if that requires that further legislation be passed. I also give a guarded welcome to the broad thrust of the Bill but will wait to see whether it will provide a healthy retail sector without forcing out the small corner shops which have formed part of Irish communities for many years. We may be emotional about the matter but the reality is that small shops the length and breadth of the country provide families with incomes and a great deal of part-time employment opportunities. Some have sponsored local football or soccer clubs and, while others have not sponsored any clubs, all are part and parcel of communities. They should be given every encouragement because they answered the call by making major investments in their facilities.

That comment encapsulates the move to the right in the UK over the past generation. Sadly, however, another of Margaret Thatcher's main legacies was the death of towns and villages across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales because she encouraged competition and, by doing so, allowed the main players to take over the retail sector with large out-of-town shopping centres. Not only did that kill off small family retailers and corner shops but it drained the life blood that allowed towns and villages to survive. As a previous speaker noted, a similar process has taken place in other countries over the past 20 to 30 years.If we engage in the race to the bottom proposed in this Bill, we will end up with a small number of large players in control of the retail market here. That is not good for communities, family businesses, towns or rural communities. Unless we are careful, the joint legacy of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be the death of small retailers in Ireland. As Ireland becomes a more open and globalised economy, it is becoming more important to nurture and protect that which makes us special. If we are not careful, we will go from the small towns that we know and love to the American mall in the space of a generation, a transformation which will have taken place on this Government's watch.The irony is that international literature makes a strong case for the protection of villages and small towns and argues that we should allow people to live above their shops and enable them to make trips on foot or by bicycle. However, Ireland is going in the opposite direction by opening up larger supermarkets, getting more people into cars and SUVs, pumping an oil-driven economy and forcing people to spend more time travelling and less time enjoying life.We need to protect consumers by preventing this race to the bottom. This Government has to be stopped from walking into the room at every opportunity with Wrigleys, Shell or Ikea and allowing big business to walk out with the better deal. We have to protect the small people but this Government has no interest in doing so. The triple back flip performed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, when he was asked to jump to facilitate Ikea in Ballymun demonstrates that this Government simply wants to protect big business. It is remarkable that the stores Ikea was forced to build in London are a third of the size of the ones elsewhere in Europe, yet in Ireland the Minister leans over backwards and says "take me now".We have to protect our unique character, which includes villages and towns and smaller businesses and retailers. It is a simplistic argument to say that we should open up to competition and allow big business to do what it wants. This Government stood idly by at the rise of the super pub. It banned magic mushrooms, yet allows the free sale of the two most dangerous drugs, nicotine and alcohol, which kill thousands each year.The Government only intervenes when it feels it is in its interest to do so.We need controls to protect the existing retail environment. I am not suggesting we go back to the days when the bell rang when one pushed open the door of the small shop and one's choices in there were limited to marrowfat peas or spaghetti in a tin. I am not suggesting that consumers' choices should be limited, but we should not allow a laissez-faire policy to prevail, which will bring us to the car park of a Wal-Mart within a few years. I am suggesting that small businesses should be supported. I am further suggesting that an older person should be able to walk to a corner shop and find that it is still open and not boarded up, but that requires Government intervention. It requires that the Government does not lift the cap on retail outlet size, is committed to proper planning or simply believes that planning is a good thing in the first instance, although I have my doubts as to whether the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, believes that. It requires some variation of the groceries order, but I see no evidence of commitment on the part of the Government.This Bill, as Deputy Kelleher pointed out, will facilitate hypermarkets, increase travel times, reduce our sense of community and force people into cars to drive to supermarkets because their local shop is closed. That is not the way we should go. This process is starting with Ikea, but can it be long before we see representatives of Wal-Mart going in the door of the Custom House and coming out with a grin on their faces? I do not think that day is too far away and I am not sure where all this will end. I suspect it will end in the kind of retail environment that exists in the United States, where towns are ghost towns and there is a Wal-Mart or a similar store on the outskirts, to which everybody drives. While the smaller players can have a loss-leader product on sale for a few weeks, some of the multinational retailers can afford to allow Ireland to be a loss-leader for years, while they watch the smaller businesses die — such is the scale at which they operate.I note that this Bill intends to ban the demanding of hello money, but it spells goodbye to the corner shop. We need a cap on retail outlet size, a proper planning environment and some form of groceries order. If I can make a plea for anything in this debate, it is that we recognise and cherish the sense of community that we have here, the towns with varied shops that we can walk around and where we can chat with neighbours. We should be very wary of simply opening the door to all players who wish to come in and allowing them to build their hypermarkets on greenfield sites. This will consign all of us to having to drive to do our weekly shopping. It will mean that the most vulnerable people in society, older and young people, will not be able to walk to a corner shop and, for that reason, my party will oppose this Bill.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	208	There has been much discussion about the repeal of the groceries order and this Bill is introduced in that context. Instead of totally relying on the so-called experts, it would be useful to ask people what is making them fearful about retaining their local shops and why we are seeing so many such shops disappearing. It is interesting when one hears at first hand from people on these issues. It is not difficult to see that the independent retail sector is in a state of decline. This is often because of location, accessibility, convenience and so forth. This decline was happening prior to the repeal of the groceries order and we must ask why, whether we care about it and whether we want to retain the independent outlets. Independent retailers, many of whom are not in the grocery trade and are therefore not covered by the order, are a dying breed. One only has to look at our towns and villages and the number of multiples operating in them. Petrol stations are becoming more like convenience stores.The decline is not simply because competition from multiples affects independent retailers. Such retailers are not part of the planning system and are not valued as part of that system. There are plenty of pious platitudes in town and county plans about supporting independent retailers but when one looks closely one sees that there is precious little practical support for town, village and neighbourhood centres in such plans. If a car park is to be built, for example, it is usually done by the private sector in conjunction with a significant new shopping centre. The approach by planners is a hands-off one.It is often much more expensive to construct a retail outlet in a town centre than on a greenfield site on the periphery and the latter option is generally preferred by the larger retail operations as it makes traffic planning easier and does not confine them in terms of size. Such developments are car dominant but we need to encourage people to get out of their cars and into the shops. If we do not provide for that and recognise that ready access must be included in the planning system, the policy becomes car-driven by default.Our development pattern is not based on deliberate forward planning but on controlling development, based on the premise that big is beautiful. Many of our towns and villages cannot support large scale shopping complexes because their centres are so constrained. Rather than having a mixture of medium-sized developments, where each town is self-sufficient, we have larger retail developments on the periphery of towns and the car becomes essential for travel to such developments because often there is no public transport available. That has a knock-on effect, particularly for those people who do not have private transport. They cannot avail of the economies of scale of such outlets, thus reducing their shopping bills and often they are the people who need to do so.An article in the The Irish Times today referred to the fact that, from a tourism perspective, Ireland has become less attractive because there is a sameness about the country and it has lost a certain amount of individuality. Such individuality comes from individual shops, whether they be grocers, drapers, booksellers or whatever. The vibrancy that comes from many people mingling, going in and out of varied shops, adds to the character of a place. While we should not solely focus on tourism, shopping is a serious part of most tourists’ experience. Very few people go on holidays without including shopping at some point. I am not a big fan of retail therapy but I acknowledge that shopping is important.The small neighbourhood outlets that cater for day-to-day needs cannot compete with the large bulk buyers and their goods are therefore more expensive. The comments of organisations such as Crosscare and the Combat Poverty Agency should not be ignored in that context. The anti-poverty strategy introduced during the term of the rainbow Government required poverty-proofing of policy. That does not integrate with this policy because the organisations saying there is a difficulty are those that articulate the difficulties of the poorest of society.The multiple outlet can provide car parking, late night opening, security and other peripherals. A shop owner on the main street in Maynooth told me that of the shops on the street 20 years ago, only two remain. There is a new shopping centre up the road with car parking and she said that she would have to move there to compete. Her difficulty, however, was that she would need to mortgage her house to do it because she cannot front-load money in the same way as the multiple operators. That is how the individual is disadvantaged. Many people were coming into the shop, perhaps because there was a sale, but this demonstrates the difficulties for the individual shop owner.This does not necessarily mean each town gets a large multiple. In Leixlip there is a population of 18,000 but until Lidl opened a store 18 months ago, there was no multiple. Scale did not bring the requisite shopping centre. Instead of towns with character, however, where people go into shops, main streets are dominated by estate agents, banks, accountants and solicitors during the day and at night by activity around bars. A whole segment is missing, leading to a loss of character. The smaller individuals who cater to specialist taste are being lost, meaning that we must go to a deli counter in a supermarket to get some things.This has an impact on the quality of people's lives but it is not regretted until it is gone. We cannot be passive about this. There must be a proactive approach where we deliberately stress the importance of this sector. We must do more than protect it in an academic sense, we must do it in a practical way by giving these retailers an opportunity to continue in business. It is not just about retaining grocery stores but also craft stores, book shops and clothes shops. Provision must be made for people getting to them, civilising our streets and making them attractive, and for traffic management. I have mixed views about the groceries order in that context because there has been a decline in these areas since it has been in place.I remember the day the Liffey Valley centre opened. Someone noted on the radio that we spent 800 years getting the British to leave, only to discover that they had come back to Liffey Valley, where all the British multiples were located. That describes the situation well. If we want British high streets, let us go there but let us keep some element of individuality to describe ourselves. That was humorous but it reflects what is happening.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Deputy Cassidy will be taking two minutes of my time. He has done considerable work in his committee on the background to this Bill and the issue we are debating today.I hope the Minister of State and his officials will report the suggestions made in this debate to the Minister, that those suggestions will be taken on board on Committee Stage and that the Government will accept some amendments to the Bill. Listening even to speakers on the Government side, it is hard to know how Deputies would vote in an open vote. Some have hedged their bets on this legislation. That is significant because there is obvious concern about the content of the Bill and the ability of the Competition Authority to enforce its provisions. The finer detail of the Bill reveals huge challenges for the authority and I hope it is up to them.I am one of the few in this House who has served behind the counter in a shop, in the 1970s and 1980s. We served a community that relied on credit. Purchases were made by the quarter pound and precise numbers were counted out on the slicing machine. That was how the retail trade functioned. It relied heavily on the local cash and carry to ensure whatever special offers were being delivered by it could add to the profit margins or to the attractiveness as a retail outlet in that locality. During that time, I traded successfully with the support of that local community.Despite the groceries order, however, I saw huge changes in the trade. The country moved from the position in the 1970s, with 20% interest rates, to where we are now with rates of 4% and little or no unemployment, with a huge focus on the consumer, competition and value for money. People vote with their feet, passing the small shops and going to the superstores.I call the groceries order the restrictive practices order, because the groceries order sounds like a mechanism to protect those in the trade and prevent competition but it actually refers to price fixing, unfair discrimination, below net invoice price selling and hello money. Despite the order, the multiples still grew hugely, Lidl and Aldi came into the marketplace, Tesco developed and there was competition. A change took place whereby the corner shops no longer sold groceries, gas canisters and briquettes, and there was a greater spread of product in response to consumer demand. They are almost fast food outlets now with sandwiches and coffee to go.They are able to survive on that basis. The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 acted as a deterrent in that it was a statement about this country to companies coming here to trade. It indicated that we were interested in our communities and in protecting and developing society. To use modern terminology, it told them that we were interested in social infrastructure and capital. Local authorities are now paying consultants to produce ideas on how to create social capital. We used to have it but have decided to trade it in for something which appears sexier. Consumers are being encouraged down the route of retail therapy at a time when social infrastructure is under threat of being wiped out.I fear the Bill does not go far enough in terms of giving teeth to the Competition Authority, laying down a framework to govern the Tescos of this world and affording corner shops, which most speakers have praised as making a valuable contribution to society, protection from predatory pricing. Corner shops provided a sense of connection in local communities. They gave communities credit in the context of day-to-day living and functioned almost as a social centre in which information was exchanged. Birth, death and marriage announcements were made from my house because it was the only telephone in the locality. The current trend, on the other hand, is one of disconnection and I hope the Minister will take action to counter it in the Bill.People doing their shopping will have several lists, perhaps one for Lidl or Aldi and another for Tesco, and will have some money left over to buy items they need in an emerging type of retailer, namely, the Centra or Spar type shops. I am informed the true independent sector, which consists of the shops being forced out of the market, employs more than 40,000 staff. These shops were the cornerstone of what we knew as local communities, each of which had a sense of place in a larger urban or rural setting.In light of changes in the retail sector, I was not surprised that a debate would take place about the removal of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987. However, I expected the legislation to amend the Competition Act to provide protection from the rapid pace of change.What do I wish to happen? I do not want one player to become dominant in the marketplace. I want competition as well as a degree of protection for independent retailers and small corner shops because I believe in the value of this kind of social infrastructure and capital. It is political nonsense to pay a consultant to create social capital when we are losing it elsewhere.My problem with the Bill is that it focuses on dominance in the retail trade. The critical issue is the need to determine how one defines such dominance in order that a court case could be built should a retailer breach the legislation. No single retailer enjoys market dominance, as defined as a market share of 35% or 40%, whereas they all enjoy it when it is considered collectively. What will happens if a retailer finds he or a number of small shops are being targeted by predatory pricing? Will the Competition Authority step in on foot of a complaint and take a court case? Given that the authority has failed to show much bottle in this regard in recent times, I am not confident it would go to court. The other question is whether the Competition Authority has sufficient funding.Reading legal opinion on both sides of the argument, it becomes clear this legislation will have the makings of a great court case at some point. Do we really expect an ordinary corner shop owner to take a major multiple or retailer involved in predatory pricing to court? He or she will have gone bust before the case is heard. We are providing for a complete open market. How can we introduce in legislation a definition of a dominant position and a procedure regarding requests to the Competition Authority concerning predatory pricing, hello money or any other practice which might come into play to guarantee a supplier, control prices or facilitate a retailer in becoming the dominant player in a locality? I am most concerned about this aspect of the legislation.I read legal opinion indicating that the Competition Authority has not been particularly effective in enforcing competition law to date and retailers will have to be prepared to bear the heavy burden of enforcement. What steps will the Minister take in the Bill to ensure this burden does not fall on retailers? Other magazine reports indicate that Tesco is tipped to clean up in terms of market share. Although Deputies receive this type of information from those who lobby us, it should also be noted that Tesco reported a €2 billion annual turnover in Ireland in 2003-04, yet the company has not yet extended its network to every county and is only now gearing up to take on new consumers and become the dominant player in the market. If this transpires, we will have real trouble because the product on offer, including credit card and other facilities, will damage the retail trade here.The retail sector extends far beyond corner shops and includes, for example, cash and carries. Viewed from this perspective, the numbers of employees who would be affected if the sector were to be damaged would begin to add up. A solid area of trade which has shown creativity and makes a significant contribution to indigenous employment would be damaged, its turnover reduced and its ability to compete in the marketplace called into question. This form of competition is essential.Organisations which supported the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 have stated that these types of small shops are vital given the make-up of communities. Despite our prosperity, some people do not have sufficient income to afford a monthly shop, while others will always find managing their domestic budgets a challenge. This group relies on the corner shop. This will force them into a different method which they are not capable of following. As legislators we must be aware of that. I do not see enough in the Bill in terms of the funding or the teeth the Competition Authority requires in this new situation to defend in court what this Bill sets out. That will be detrimental to our society. I have reservations about the Bill. I hope the officials, Minister and Minister of State will acknowledge what is being said in this House and will bring forward some serious amendments to deal with the issues raised by the Members and by RGDATA.

Although the committee was unanimous in support of retaining the groceries order, the Government and the Minister have made a decision. That is their democratic right and we must accept and support it as democrats and members of the Government. When it comes before the committee on Committee Stage we will tease it out. As someone from rural Ireland who knows the importance of the villages and rural setting in which we are fortunate to live I want to correct one item in this data. It reads: "since 1990 the rate of inflation in Ireland has been three times the rate in the UK and almost twice the EU average". That may be true but in the past two years grocery prices here have fallen by 1.2% while in the UK they have increased by 1.4%. In the past two years there has been a 2.6% differential in the UK compared to Ireland.I thank the professional industry representatives who assisted the committee in its deliberations over many days. Everyone, with the exception of Dunnes Stores — Tesco, the Irish manufacturers, the Meath and north Dublin growers and the quality food producers — genuinely opened their hearts, their experiences and their books to us over many days. I was struck that the Minister said he has a serious obligation with regard to below-cost selling. Below-cost selling is unfair and I do not want to see thousands of Irish jobs lost to it. All fair-minded Members of this House want to know what protection this Bill gives to manufacturers and producers of Irish goods from below-cost selling. If there is no protection, thousands of Irish jobs will be lost three, five or seven years down the line.As we all know, the big area of growth is the convenience store. The officials and the Minister are in agreement on this. The next biggest growth area is own-brand shopping. Own-brand products may be manufactured in the same place as branded goods and labelled differently. Own-brand products do not have to show the place and date of manufacture. We all know that approximately 40% of all groceries bought in Ireland are own-brand. This is where below-cost selling can occur and pose a danger to the entire food manufacturing industry. I represent as many people as I can in my few words today. All colleagues including the Minister of State are concerned. This is an important Bill which can have far-reaching repercussions in the market place.Irish people have six shopping choices. Tesco and Dunnes Stores control almost 47% or 48% of the market while 22% is controlled by the symbol groups such as Centra. The family stores give meaningful employment, with 70, 80, 90 or 100 staff. There are the convenience stores and the corner shops, which are responsible for the social fibre of our villages or towns and with which everyone can identify. The danger of this Bill is that in the future if one does not have a car one will need to hire a taxi or mini-bus to do one's shopping. That would be wrong. In the committee we said "if it is not broken, why mend it?" If there is a good reason for various amendments we will support them. Everyone will support the Bill if there is an obligation to ensure that own-label goods display the date and place of manufacture.I live in Castlepollard, the capital town in north Westmeath. While we have a second-level college and the council services have been decentralised there, Castlepollard has no filling station. In the 12 miles from Finnea village to Donnelly's, five miles from Mullingar, which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows well, there is no filling station because of what is happening in the market place. I predict that if it continues to go this way in three or five years there will be no filling station in all of north Westmeath and people will have to travel 25 miles to buy fuel for their cars. This is wrong. I represent a rural county only 55 or 60 miles from Dublin. We cannot preside over legislation that allows a security van to reverse up to a megastore at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. on 23 December and bring the hundreds of thousands of euro back to Dublin from where it could be in Switzerland before the following morning. All our social welfare, pension and children's allowance cheques are built into this Bill and there are serious decisions to be made. While I will support the view of the Minister and the Government, the committee has concerns regarding certain sections of the Bill.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	211	This is a dual-purpose Bill. It revokes the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 and brings about changes arising from that in the Competition Act. I agree with much of what has been said by speakers from both sides of the House. In recent years I have seen huge changes in retail practices in rural Ireland. The groceries order was the target of the multiples for a number of years for some reason. They wanted to get rid of it. After the consultations and reports the Minister has eventually agreed. While I have no serious disagreement with the Minister, as a representative of a rural constituency I want to know if the Competition Authority will have enough power, muscle and influence to prevent what could happen as a result of this Act going through. I cannot understand why the multiples were so anxious to get rid of the groceries order. These changes were taking place without any amendment to that order. In my county and constituency I have seen that these changes have taken place before the order has been revoked. I go through villages in my county and I see shops closing down that were in existence for more than 100 years. Last year, I was in the village of Creeslough, which everyone has heard of in song and story, and a shop that was there for 105 years had closed down. The village of Laghey is a few miles south of Donegal town. When I came into this House for the first time 20 years ago, there were four corner shops in that village, but there is just one today. This has been happening all over rural Ireland without the groceries order being revoked. Unless there is some balance brought about, this new Bill will accelerate what has been happening in the last ten to 15 years. I am greatly anxious about how rural Ireland will look in ten or 15 years' time.The post offices in rural Ireland are being closed by the dozen every year. In my parish of Gweedore, two post offices were closed in the past six months in Crolly and Ranafast. The shop in Ranafast has also gone. Things are changing in rural Ireland and I believe that this Bill will accelerate that change to the detriment of the people living there. The people of Laghey have built a housing scheme for the elderly, but they now have just one shop when they used to have four. There is no guarantee that that shop will stay open and where will the elderly people go then? They would have to hire a car as some of them do not have any transport. Rural Ireland could do with a better public transport system. These elderly people would then have to go to the nearest town to the nearest Tesco or Aldi. This Bill could deliver a serious blow to social and commercial life in rural Ireland. The service provided by the little corner shop is not provided by the multiples. The shopkeeper always knew what the customer wanted before he or she even came in. It is a pity to see that disappear.There is nothing in this Bill to prevent predatory pricing or below cost selling. Perhaps the main reason in getting rid of the groceries order was that predatory pricing could occur. We know what that means. Prices can be reduced on a few items which are advertised on the weekend papers. Everyone flocks to the multiple for these bargains, but they then buy the rest of the groceries at prices that are over and above that which is saved on the below cost items. Can the Minister guarantee that this will not happen day after day? If that happens, it will put the remaining retail outlets in rural Ireland out of business. This also has implications for producers. Many of these multiples get their products from outside the country. What are the implications for our producers and native industries? We need to get some guarantees that these producers will have the opportunity to supply these multiples. I am not against multiples. We have a Tesco in Letterkenny that is open 24 hours a day. People come from my parish 30 miles away to shop there in the middle of the day or night and get what they want. The old shops used to stay open until 9 p.m., but they can no longer do that because the multiples provide a 24-hour service.This Bill presents serious dangers to life in rural Ireland and to our way of life that has existed for so long. I drove through England last year and I went for miles without seeing a village shop until I came to one of these multiples. That is happening in Scotland and on the Continent as well. It will be a great pity if it happens in Ireland as well. We have a unique social scene in rural Ireland. People come here from the Continent and travel to the newsagents, the butcher and other shops. If that network of shops disappears, an important and valuable element of our life will disappear. I hope the Minister will be able to give us guarantees that this will not happen and that what has already has happened in the past ten years will not be accelerated as a result of what we are doing in this Bill.The responsibility for this is being handed over to the Competition Authority. We have seen how that authority has acted and it has left much to be desired. I do not see any sign that it will be more effective in future. Perhaps the Minister can guarantee that it will. Otherwise, there may be serious repercussions for constituencies like mine, that of the Minister and that of Deputy Breen.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation for the retail business. I can remember a time not so long ago when every town and village had its own retail grocery shop. Some villages had two or three grocery shops. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case and we have seen the growth of the multiples and the large supermarket chains. In the past five years, there has been an invasion of shops like Aldi and Lidl from continental Europe. The number of these supermarkets will increase in the next five years, according to recent reports. These supermarkets cater for the needs of the public and, as legislators, we should bear in mind that we want to protect consumers as well. The best way to protect them is to ensure we have a strong and healthy indigenous retail grocery business. It is not in the interests of consumers, local communities or even suppliers to these supermarkets to allow dominant supermarket chains to take over the retail grocery sector.We have a thriving grocery retail sector that provides competition, choice and value for customers. If we are not careful, that may not be the case for the future. As legislators we need to ensure that there is fair play for local shops and food manufacturers, Irish suppliers and farmers. Agriculture is going through a particularly difficult time. We must bear in mind that the strength and size of some of these retail grocery chains could wipe out a complete sector of Irish farming and agriculture if we are not careful.In my constituency we have seen the demise of the sugar factory in Carlow. While that factory was closing down I observed imported sugar on the shelves of many supermarkets. It is unfortunate to see the demise of an industry that has stood the tests of time for almost 80 years. Now we must face not only that loss but the possibility that the country's entire sugar industry will be closed down in 2007, if not this year.I am proud to support the vibrant local communities with locally owned shopping facilities that provide a route to the market for small manufacturers and suppliers and for Irish-grown and produced meat, dairy produce, fruit and vegetables. However, if we are not careful we will ensure that there will not be a market for these small producers. It is not in anybody's interest to see the continuous rise and expansion of multinationals at the expense of local small indigenous producers.I have grave concerns that part of the legislation as worded will not deliver greater competition and protection for Irish producers and processors. Instead, it will give some of the largest retailers in the world the freedom to engage in predatory pricing and that is my main concern. I am not satisfied the legislation has closed all the loopholes. From what I have heard and read I am not confident, as yet, that companies will be barred from engaging in predatory pricing. Strong arm tactics can be introduced by companies which will eventually lead to the closure of small rural shops in particular. We have listened to many submissions on the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and have had many debates over the past year on this issue. The vast majority of the committee's members, if not all, are genuinely concerned about the impact of predatory pricing on small retailers. The Bill, if possible, should expressly ban predatory pricing.I welcome the Minister's statement that he will look at this issue and return to it on Committee Stage. I assume Committee Stage will be debated by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business where there will be a forum to engage in a more practical and effective manner with the Minister on this aspect of the Bill. I know the Minister is prepared to listen and take on board the concerns of many people, not just in the grocery sector, but in other areas of Irish industry and commercial life.In a Fianna Fáil meeting recently we were circulated with an article from The Grocer magazine, which makes startling reading. It talks about the dominance of Tesco in the UK and the effect this monopoly has had on retailers there. Tesco currently has 25% of the Irish market. It is a market share that is growing as Tesco opens larger stores. It proposes to open another 30 in the next few years and that market share will certainly increase. There comes a stage when we must be concerned about the dominance of one player in the market. Unless we legislate to expressly ban predatory pricing, Irish consumers will have less choice, less competition and the market will mainly comprise multinational retail groups.However, I commend Irish retailers, Dunnes Stores in particular, an Irish-owned company that can compete with anything the multinational retailers have thrown up. Likewise, SuperValu, part of the Cork-based Musgrave group, runs a very professional show to ensure that its shops around the country are as good as anything that may be seen on the international stage. Unless we expressly ban predatory pricing, then in the long-run Irish consumers will suffer, although it will not happen immediately. Smaller players require much more than the existing references in competition law. It is important to remember the number of small and medium-sized outlets that have closed in Ireland in recent years. Unless we introduce legislation to protect such traders against predatory pricing from the large multinationals, many more of them will close.In the UK, it is interesting to note that more than 2,000 family-owned grocery shops closed last year, due to low-cost selling and multiples opening smaller stores. This information was contained in a report to an all-party committee at Westminister. Between 1997 and 2002 more than 50 independent food shops closed in the UK each week because of pressures from large multiples. There is an opportunity to ensure this does not happen here and it is important that is enshrined in the legislation. I welcome the legislation and the opportunity to debate with the Minister on Committee Stage any proposals he might have on copperfastening the ban on predatory pricing. As a small country with 4 million people and a relatively small retail market in the context of our European partners, we have a duty and responsibility to protect those small retailers and thus, the customers. If a small shop closes it will not re-open, let us not forget. If we reach a stage where the Tescos of this world put small concerns out of business we will not see any reversal of that trend in the future because they will not re-open. I commend the Minister for bringing forward the legislation and hope we can fine tune it on Committee Stage.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I have listened to many of the speakers this morning and last Thursday, when the Minister first introduced the Bill, followed by Deputies Hogan, Howlin and others. Most of the speakers, even on the Government side, raised concerns about the Bill and the effects it will have on smaller shops. The revocation of the groceries order by the Minister, Deputy Martin, is one of the principal purposes of this Bill, with the ending of certain restrictive practices. These aspects of the Bill are welcome although the qualified ending of so-called hello money is mystifying and does not appear to be achievable. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us as to how hello money could not but have been an object or the effect of prevention, restriction or the distortion of competition in trade in grocery goods in any part of the State. Even if hello money could be deemed benign, I doubt that the Department would send personnel to inspect such instances and make appropriate rulings. Members are well aware of the dismal failure of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to police abuses in the labour market adequately, to the extent that a book on the misery and abuse of foreign nationals here is now a best seller in Latvia.Everybody knew the groceries order had to be changed. It has been in place for the past 18 years. However, what the Minister has done will have an effect in every county. There will be job losses. I drive through the small towns and villages in my constituency each week and one can see the effect the multinationals are having on the industry. There are few shops in the villages now. Recently, I tried to compile a database of all the shops in County Clare. I eventually compiled a list from telephone directories and old lists. I sent a letter to the shops and was astonished by how many letters were returned because most of the shops had gone out of business. It is a worrying trend.So-called hello money aside, the underlying issues which prompted this Bill remain. These include the issues of consumer prices and rip-off Ireland. Can we be sure that prices will come down, as promised by the consumer strategy group, and will the golden era that was promised when the order was revoked come to pass? Many doubt it. There is cynicism among consumers about the ability of the Government to implement quality measures which do not impact directly on people's pockets, whether it be motorways and tolling, improving health services or taking steps to promote house price inflation which benefits Government coffers as the single biggest form of stealth tax. Meanwhile, insurance, child care and energy costs soar. It would be a welcome change if this Bill were to be a white knight for the hard-pressed consumer but I do not believe that will be the case.The other issues that prompted debate on the groceries order are the growing power of the multiples, the growing concentration of retail outlets and the demise of the corner shop. This week in County Clare a consortium of three business people offered the GAA county board in Ennis a deal to provide a 42,000 seater stadium with an all-purpose weather pitch on a greenfield site outside the town in exchange for Cusack Park in Ennis where they propose to build a shopping centre. Huge money is available to the multinationals to secure sites in town centres. Tesco, for example, is looking at sites in Kilrush, the third largest town in County Clare. Multinationals such as Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Aldi and Lidl are already in Shannon and Ennis. Greenfield sites in town centres are extremely valuable and business people are trying to acquire them because they know the multinationals have plenty of money to spend on prime locations for their outlets.One need only look at the Sunday newspapers to see the amount spent on advertising by the multinationals. There are pages of colour advertisements displaying the bargains on offer in their supermarkets. It obviously costs a huge sum of money to take out colour advertisements in Sunday newspapers. The same is occurring with the provincial newspapers, in which the multinationals take full page colour advertisements every week. This shows the power and impact they have on the consumer and how they can direct people to their supermarkets.Not only is there a danger of creating a problem in local areas but we are fast approaching a situation where a car will be necessary for every shopping trip as people are forced to go to out-of-town shopping centres. I recently visited a new mall that was opened about a month ago in Limerick. The size of the mall and the number of retail outlets were such that one could shop there all day. These malls are a huge attraction to the consumer and that is the reason they can afford so much advertising. The multinationals attract the smaller franchise groups into their centres.The same can be said for town centres. The old shops are disappearing from the streets of town centres and are being replaced with English chain stores such as Boots. That is not a good thing for the consumer. I read a report produced in Britain recently and it showed that there is greater concern there than here about the demise of the corner shop. According to a survey conducted there recently, cars were used for 62% of shopping trips last year compared with 49% in 1991. It is necessary to drive out of town to visit shopping centres and people tend to spend more money at these centres than they would at smaller outlets. The situation in Ireland is probably similar or worse but I am not aware that any such survey has been conducted here.The other issue is the increase in the number of garage forecourt shops in recent years. They were once hailed as the great hope of the independent sector and they have consolidated themselves in this country. However, this week a worrying trend emerged. The Norwegian company Statoil has said it intends to sell its outlets in Ireland. One can draw a number of conclusions from that decision but the main one is that the company does not envisage a future for these garages.Statoil is a state-owned company in Norway and has not been operating in this country for long. It is looking for between €200 million and €300 million for its outlets. The company obviously foresees a danger coming from the other multinationals. Tesco has gone into the business of selling petrol at cheaper rates and companies such as Statoil are anticipating fierce competition. That is a big danger for the forecourt outlets. It is also rumoured that another major concern, Texaco, is thinking of putting its outlets up for sale. These oil companies are making major decisions and they are obviously aware of what is happening in the market.Giving a free rein to these multiples in the name of choice and competition will have the opposite effect. The Bill could be entitled the anti-competition amendment Bill. As the Fine Gael spokesperson on small business, in conjunction with Deputy Hogan, I am well aware of the choice available to people to buy locally sourced products. If the multinationals are allowed to wipe out our local shops, much of our food will be sourced from elsewhere. Look, for example, at the mushroom industry and the crisis facing mushroom farmers where there are cartels and prices are controlled. Mushrooms are a delicate product with a short shelf life. If a company rejects Irish mushrooms, it can buy cheaper mushrooms from Poland, Holland or elsewhere. It is only when bad weather in Poland or Holland affects production that the Irish consumer benefits. Consumers are at the disposal of such people and cartels when it comes to Irish products.We could also take pork products as an example. This week many farmers came to the Dáil to protest against the nitrates directive, which is a separate issue. Such protests have to do with how we sell our produce, specifically pork products. We see a packet of rashers sold by a well known company here as an Irish product. We get the impression from the Irish name that we are buying Irish rashers, but we are not. These are pork products from South America that are packaged and produced here.These issues will have a significant effect on the grocery business here. This week we heard that Dublin has earned the honour of being the 16th most expensive city in the world. Some believe that because our economy is successful, Dublin is as successful. It is an expensive city and a rip-off culture prevails in the manner in which consumers are treated there.I could speak further about what is happening in the grocery business, in particular the technology some of the multinationals will introduce that will create more job losses. In supermarkets people will be able to bring their basket of groceries to the checkout where it will be scanned automatically. This will cut down on employees.Rural shops are vulnerable. They have low profit margins and face fierce competition. We have a duty to protect these shops in the interest of our rural areas and to sustain employment in these areas. The same should be done for rural post offices which are in decline. As services close down, we will soon get to the stage where local shops will also close down. Many houses are being built in small villages and towns, but unfortunately consumers are attracted to the multinationals in out of town areas where they can do their weekly shopping. As a result, small shops are ignored.I predict opposition to this Bill on account of its failure to protect consumers in a number of key areas. I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister and the Chairman of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business will listen to the Opposition. I hope some protection will be provided for small shops. These have been great and have been there to help people. Now we are in a different world and consumers want choice. As we do not have a large population, we are being subsumed into the British, German and US markets.I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this Bill and hope the Minister will listen to the amendments that will be tabled by party spokespersons on Committee Stage.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	214	This Bill is very much a mixed bag and, like the curate's egg, good in parts. Nobody really knows what will happen. I have read a significant number of submissions were made on whether the groceries order should be abolished and know the major number of submissions to the Minister came from small shopkeepers. The consumers' champion, Eddie Hobbs, appeared to lead the charge on behalf of consumers, with consumer associations and groups, to abolish the groceries order. These two distinct groups have distinct opinions as to how matters will pan out.Practice is changing in Ireland and we live in a culture of constant change. We can no longer consider Ireland an island nation because of the convenience of air travel and our membership of the European Union which has opened up our borders to a degree that could not have been anticipated. We live in a global market and a changing situation. Major changes have taken place. For many years I have spoken of the demise of rural areas and the vicious circle whereby when we lose services and infrastructure, we lose people. Who wants to live in an area where there are no shops where people can buy a loaf of bread or whatever? Who wants to live in an area where there is no doctor who can provide urgent medical care when needed? Who wants to live in an area without a school, post office or gardaí to protect them? I could go on. People have the right to basic services.Free market competition is something we cannot deny. We are part of the European Union which is predisposed more towards the market, economics and wealth making than towards social concerns. This is the problem I have with what is happening in this area. We must ask where we are headed as a society. This debate on the groceries order has brought home to many people that there are forces involved we must reckon with. What can we do about the situation when so much is happening beyond our control?People have spoken about how shops will close down if the groceries order is abolished and have said that if this legislation goes through it will be detrimental to rural areas. The issue is not that clear. Having read the Competition Authority report into the groceries order, I understand how the Government may have succumbed to the pressure from Eddie Hobbs, his followers and the public to abolish it. I do not think the Government really understands what will happen. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is pushing this agenda. While I laud him for introducing the revolutionary legislation establishing the smoking ban, and while he may be remembered as the Minister for Health and Children who saved and will save the most lives, he did not do much else for the health service. It was left in a greater mess than that in which he found it, especially in terms of the need for people to stay in their own areas. Half the graduates in my area have to go to Dublin to get their first job although they ought to be able to find work locally. This prompts us to question Government policy.Government policy, while acknowledging that there should be a free market, should involve rural-proofing. It should acknowledge a certain minimum standard applying all the way down the line from service providers to people buying a loaf of bread in a shop. The Government can have a major effect in this regard. Is this legislation right or wrong for the people of rural Ireland?The Government, in its policies, has very much favoured big businesses, large retailers and those who make a buck from whatever is going on. A good example was referred to last night in respect of supports for older people. While 5% of old people end up in residential care, it appears the private sector is really the sector making money in this area. While there are some very dedicated and altruistic people looking after older people, including nursing home staff, the vast majority of whom are doing a very good job, profit is the bottom line. By cutting corners they can make even more money. There should be much greater emphasis on communities. Community members can carry out services better than private sector operators because their bottom line is the support of older people in the community rather than making money. The Government needs to become more involved in supporting communities in this regard and should give community carers the same opportunities and incentives as those afforded to people in the private sector. The legislation in this area is very clear and does not favour communities carrying out these functions.On the groceries order, many cornerstores have closed in rural areas. It seems they are being replaced by petrol stations with forecourts which also serve as convenience stores. While shops may be closing in rural areas, they will be replaced with these convenience stores. However, they may not be owned by the retailer but by multinationals. We have seen across the board that multinationals appear to be calling the shots and setting the agenda. This is very unfortunate. Regardless of how the sector develops — I do not believe anybody knows how it will pan out — the Government has a responsibility to monitor the sector closely so detrimental effects on rural areas can be noted and dealt with. I hope the Government will do so.I do not believe people in rural areas will eventually have nowhere to buy a loaf of bread or carton of milk, as has been suggested, because there is a niche for convenience stores. To believe otherwise is not comparing like with like. People are going to the supermarkets in larger urban centres to do their shopping but when they want to buy perishables they go to their local store, be it a retail outlet owned by Tesco or one of the oil companies. This seems to be the trend.The Government needs to ensure rural-proofing of legislation. While there needs to be a free market, the Government has responsibility to protect citizens and ensure minimum standards are maintained. It also has responsibility to ensure citizens have reasonable access to services — otherwise the vicious circle to which I referred will continue. We have seen that when the Government fails to provide money for services and infrastructure in rural areas, people leave those areas and are forced into the urban centres. They are not prepared to live in areas without services — this is logical.On the question of planning, the Irish Rural Dwellers Association has drawn attention to the difficulty experienced by citizens when trying to find accommodation in rural areas. Groups such as Rural Resettlement Ireland have done great good by bringing people from Tallaght, County Dublin, for example, to rural areas. The people concerned have got on quite well and have ended up supporting local schools. This is the sort of initiative the Government needs to continue to support. Otherwise I do not know what the future will bring.Let us consider big business. I referred in the Chamber today to the need for the Government to get on the rails again as regards the mediation process pertaining to the Corrib gas project. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, made a commitment to five people, who were released from jail, that there would be mediation between themselves, Shell and the Corrib gas partners. Unfortunately, he managed to reach a point where the process was so broad that the five Rossport men pulled out. The process is going nowhere and means nothing anymore. The Minister needs to return to mediation. It appears he misled the Dáil in stating what exactly was to happen because the process in train is clearly not what he promised the five men when they were released from jail. He needs to examine this.On the groceries order, there is a way forward. The Tweedledee and Tweedledum of the big parties have not been supporting what is happening right across the board in terms of community initiatives. There is not adequate support for communities but there is always so much support for non-community enterprises. The Government should examine the fact that the system favours the profit-maker, in the planning system, for example. I have been involved in various community enterprises and found this to be true. From having spoken to people throughout the country, I have found they have major difficulties in trying to secure planning permission in rural areas. This is particularly true in respect of community initiatives, yet big businesses can get tax exemptions and planning permission for hotels, nursing homes and so forth. The Government needs to address this. The alliance of Independent Members, who are the nearest link to the people and do not have a party agenda to interfere with their wishes, are best placed to carry out the agenda.

The market will bring it about by itself but the Government has great power to do so and I hope it will. Having brought forward the Bill, it should consider the position of businesses which are struggling to survive in rural areas, particularly the west. Unfortunately, in a place such as Achill or Belmullet, business costs and expenses are similar to elsewhere and similar wages, heating bills and rates must be paid. The rate for a rural hotel in Achill is €18,000 a year. Given that the season is so short, these costs must be paid with the earnings of a few months at best, which is difficult.Such businesses do not have as much of what the trade would call footfall as O'Connell Street in Dublin, for example. Hotels are opening on O'Connell Street and in many other locations owing to Government incentives, and they are doing well because of the high footfall — the number passing their doors. The Government must consider what is happening in places such as Achill and the need to give rural hotels a means to survive. Many businesses have closed owing to the shortness of the season and the fact that costs are the same as in O'Connell Street whereas the number of customers is lower.If the Government wants tourists to visit places like Achill, it must consider what it can do for such areas. It should examine the role of Ireland West Airport Knock in the context of balanced regional development. Some 500,000 people visit the west each year through Knock Airport whereas 25 million visit the east and south and 6 million visit Northern Ireland through the airports in those regions. Given that the population of the Border, midlands and west region is almost the same as that of Northern Ireland, one must ask why there is this discrepancy. The reason is lack of investment by the Government. All that Knock Airport received from Government was €5 million. If the airport had received the basic Aer Rianta payment of €3 per passenger during the years, Knock Airport would have received approximately €119 million, or up to €190 million at a higher rate per passenger. Instead, it got €5 million.How can businesses, hotels and shops in the area compete when the Government has not made the required investment? Knock Airport has specific needs in the coming years for which it requires €29 million. This investment should be made because Knock Airport is a major catalyst for the development of the west. Considering that there is a €3.5 billion underspend——

During a recent celebration of the welcome arrival of three fire engines at the airport, two new and one second-hand, an aeroplane was unable to land for a considerable period because the lack of category 2 navigational status meant that fog prevented the landing. Knock Airport is the only international airport in Ireland that does not have this status.The Government must not only consider the abolition of the groceries order but should also consider what it can do for businesses, which not only exist in O'Connell Street, Dublin. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael — Tweedledum and Tweedledee — have based so much——

Nonetheless, it is good that the Bill is still alive. As I always say, where there is life, there is hope. For a country that has taken so much from the European Union during the years, it amazes me that we have never been able to stand on our own two feet or stand back and dictate the kind of Europe we want.We all know that this country is in its infancy with regard to building. I hope there will be another 20 years of construction and long may the current property boom last, although the time will come when enough houses have been built and building comes to a halt. However, the industry on which this country has been built and of which we can always be proud is the food industry. That industry will be gone because we will have handed over the reins to every other country to import food at a cheap price but at a quality those countries cannot stand over.A family in Ashbourne, County Meath, sold their own lettuce, potatoes and vegetables of every sort. Approximately 700 people a week visited the farm and bought the produce because they knew its quality and provenance, as it was grown on the family land. Last Tuesday, however, the business was closed down. There was a minor planning problem which could have been rectified, but the reason for the closure was because the three main supermarket chains constantly complained to Meath County Council about this man and his wife and children growing their own food and selling it. Unfortunately, that business is gone and the food has been ploughed back into the ground because there is nowhere to sell it.Nobody can stand over the standard of the products consumers buy from shop shelves. For years Ireland built slatted units for meat and received grants from the European Union but these units are now idle. The bit of quality beef we produce is bought by the rich of different countries while most of our supermarkets and eating places import substandard food from South America. We know that meat which is supposedly from Brazil is not from there because Brazil now supplies most of Europe with beef and is running short. Beef is imported untagged and untraceable from other countries and this is what the Irish people are asked to eat.For the past 60 years, small shops in small towns and villages always stocked the quality food we enjoyed. Quality of life was always good, as was the health of the people. When questions about why this country has such high rates of diseases like stomach cancer are finally answered, they will reveal that the culprit is the change in our diet and the food chain, involving as it does the increased production of processed food without proper monitoring of its effects on human health. Stomach cancer is practically non-existent in China, where rice has been the main diet for many years. Ireland has reached a stage where age means nothing with regard to developing cancer. It might take another 15 to 20 years for research into this area to come to light, but it will show that the increase in cancer is due to our food chain.Deputy Cowley likened Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, but everyone in this House, with the Irish people, has been responsible for the country's success. I would like to think that we could preserve our agricultural sector and villages. I do not wish Ireland to become like the United Kingdom where people living in villages must travel 30 or 40 miles to shop or go for a drink. We seem to be heading in that direction. Perhaps we should work together on this matter. Some speakers have commented that Fianna Fáil backbenchers oppose this Bill but we should put our heads together in respect of our agricultural products, towns, villages and food.

#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	227	We should be able to stand over everything we eat. We should ensure that when the building boom ends, our agriculture sector will not have disappeared. Everyone knows that it has practically disappeared. Only 10,000 farmers will be producing food in the next five or six years given the introduction of various measures prohibiting farmers from producing certain foods.The case cited by me concerning the family in Ashbourne, where seven or eight jobs were lost, is a reflection of how the big players can push out the small operator. I can understand why busy people choose to shop in places where they can pick up everything they need in five minutes at a good price. However, everyone knows that if small farmers or businesses are put out of business, prices will rise in ten years' time and food stores will introduce greater mark-ups. Such developments are taking place in the milk industry. Cheap milk from the United Kingdom is entering the Irish market because farmers have abandoned the land in England and the country has excess quota, which is entering the Northern Ireland market at 1p or 2p per litre. The farmers in Northern Ireland can then flood the market down here. It is a pity that Ireland cannot obtain some of this quota, which might sustain some of our farmers who must produce 155,000 gallons of milk per year to make a half decent wage. It will drive the dairy farmer out of business; a scenario which will be replicated in every other sector of our food industry.I hope the debate on this Bill will continue and that when the building boom ends or stalls, our agriculture and villages will still exist. I hope our economy never collapses. The boom will continue for another 15 or 20 years because, through no fault of our own, we have only recently been capable of building this country up to the required standard. Everyone is responsible for ensuring the survival of our agriculture and villages, particularly the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who apparently did not want to listen to the farming community the other day. Agriculture, tourism, food, small villages and pubs are the reason for this country's success.Ireland is a jolly nation and its people do not wish to become robots and be forced to travel 30 or 40 miles to buy their groceries on Saturday night or Sunday morning. That is the direction in which Irish retail is heading. Shops are open at the weekend not only from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. but from 6 a.m to 8 a.m., which is madness. I hope changes might be made to this Bill or that people might realise that agriculture and the food chain are major parts of this country and that small villages cannot be allowed to disappear.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak about this very important legislation. Before I address the technical details of the Bill, I will follow up on Deputy McEntee's excellent contribution. He spoke about the relationship between food and health, an issue which is larger than the Government and encompasses every Member of the Oireachtas. The points he raised about health and concerns about many modern foods are very relevant to this debate.Agriculture, tourism, small businesses and small pubs are at the heart of Ireland, make it different throughout the world and should be part of this wider debate. We are missing out on this and I welcome the Deputy's comments in this regard. As a representative of Dublin North-Central, I know that many people share my and Deputy McEntee's concern about the deterioration of the wider society. If the small shop or local pub is lost and the large investors come on to the pitch, the integrity of society and the economy is damaged. I urge people to reflect on this point because Irish society is at a crossroads. Which direction will it take? Will we move to the extreme right and usher in a dog-eat-dog society or will we begin reflecting about society and looking out for our neighbours and shopkeepers? The sad reality is that society has become very impersonal, which is relevant to today's debate. It is important for us to touch on these issues in the debate on this Bill.I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is present to listen to the views on this Bill, including those which are critical. I will provide an independent view of the legislation. This Bill will have serious repercussions for Irish consumers and the thousands of Irish businesses involved in the production, supply and sale of food in Ireland. It will have major implications for the provision of local facilities in all our communities. I will develop these themes later. I am concerned that the Minister got the balance wrong in this legislation. The Bill will do nothing to prevent larger retailers from squeezing smaller retailers and suppliers as part of their greedy battle for increased market share.The Bill does not contain any practical proposals to tackle the considerable market power of the larger multiples and has no effective mechanism to prevent them from abusing their power. If this legislation is enacted in its current form, it will lead to less choice for Irish consumers, greater consolidation in the marketplace and, ultimately, less Irish-produced food. This debate relates to both health and the community. The Bill will not provide any safeguard to ensure fair play in the food market and will give the largest retailers in this market a legislative basis with which to squeeze out competitors without sanction or fear of regulatory reproach. These retailers will be able to use every means at their disposal, including predatory pricing, the demanding of hello money, the abuse of credit terms and the imposition of unfair contract terms on suppliers. If the Minister wishes to ensure that consumers benefit from cheaper prices and greater choice and competition in retail, he must introduce real and meaningful controls to prevent unfair play in the food sector and ensure meaningful competition in retail.I hope the Government will support the strengthening of this Bill as it goes through the Dáil to ensure it genuinely facilitates and achieves effective competition in retail. Creating a legislative basis for the largest market players to grow even larger will not achieve this purpose.We have reached a crossroads in respect of the wider debate on competition, business, small shops and the role of agriculture and the community. The best way to sum this up is to liken it to the debate on television personalities, where some people prefer Brendan O'Connor and others prefer Des Bishop. O'Connor's mannerism, for example, is built on greed, being self-centred, degrading people and a right-wing economic agenda. The mannerism of Des Bishop, or Bishopism as I term it, is built on understanding, having respect for people, especially in marginalised communities, and giving such people hope and positivity. This debate is somewhat like that debate. One can have O'Connorism or Bishopism. I urge Deputies to take on Bishopism as it gives hope and respect to the person and it benefits the community. It is important to state this in the broader debate.This Bill contains six sections: amendment of the Competition Act 2002 by inserting a new Part 2A, amendment of section 30 of the Competition Act 2002, amendment of section 45 of the Competition Act 2002, revocation of the groceries order, repeals, and the Short Title and commencement. Section 1 of the legislation contains an amendment to the Competition Act 2002 by inserting a new Part 2A to prevent certain unfair trading practices in the groceries trade. I accept that it is important to have this. Section 15B sets out new rules regarding anti-competitive conduct in the groceries sector. Section 15B(1) is designed to prohibit resale price maintenance in the groceries sector.These are important, and although it is very well to have a debate about competition and prices, we must not lose sight of the quality issue, in particular the quality of a product or particular food. This is related to the health debate. We should face the reality that consumers have major concerns about the quality of food in the State and there is a lack of confidence on the issue. This is a reality, be it in a debate about cancer or other illnesses. People have that concern. We must reflect on this. I stated with regard to remarks made by Deputy McEntee that this is bigger than one political party or the Government. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children should pursue this topic as problems are emerging in the broader society.People may discuss the period in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when there were outbreaks of tuberculosis in the State. This was a major crisis, solved thanks to people such as Noel Browne, who was also an Independent Member of this House and had a strong health mandate. With the current issue, an important factor to consider is that we had a crisis involving TB and we had to respond to it. We have a cancer crisis in the State in 2006, and many believe major contributory factors are the chemicals and preservatives in foods. The jury is out on the issue and I urge academics and medical people involved in research to open their eyes to it. The matter will become more apparent in a few years. It is important that the consumer has confidence in the quality of food.Section 15B(3) is designed to prohibit parties from compelling or coercing others to pay advertising allowances. I welcome this as it deals with the matter of corruption in business. Section 15B(4) is designed to prohibit so-called hello money in new or extended retail outlets. Section 15C(1) confers the right of action on any person who is aggrieved as a result of actions prohibited under section 15B. A similar right of action is provided for the Competition Authority. It is important to consider these issues.It is important that we do not allow ourselves to lose small local shops, whether these are in an urban, rural or island area. Small shops and businesses are very important. We must support them in this debate, and I will side with the smaller shopkeeper and service provider in the local community. It is important as this shop is more than just a place where a person can get bread or milk. It is a local community centre for many. They may drop in to the shop for a chat, or older people may drop in because they live on their own in the area. These people have the opportunity, when getting the paper, for example, to be proactive and involved with the local community.The small shop is also personable and accountable to the local community. We all have experiences of the local shopkeeper being supportive of the voluntary community, be it in football clubs or community and residents groups. In the past week one of my local shops has been involved in a project with me on raising funds for children and adults with a disability. These are commonplace examples.As we are discussing the rights of the small shopkeeper in the context of this Bill, we have a duty to protect the people concerned commercially and from a security perspective. In recent days, an owner of a small off-licence in my constituency attended my clinic and reported that he had been robbed three times in the past four weeks. Robberies took place twice with guns and the last robbery was carried out by a gang with knives at 12.40 p.m. last Tuesday. The unfortunate man was terrified. On the first two occasions he was made lie on the floor while guns were put to his head, all for €200 or €300. The last incident was more serious and the man was more fearful because knives were held to his person as the gang stole cigarettes and alcohol. This is an indication of the way society is heading.It is important that we defend the interests of law-abiding citizens who provide a valuable community service and who need our support. People nonetheless attack and abuse them. I have already raised the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I will not tolerate any of my constituents being treated in this way. We must face the reality that these types of crimes are taking place. It is a nonsense that a programme such as "Crimecall" shows petty crime incidence when my constituency is subject to robberies at gun and knife point, and it is not even mentioned. It is important that these incidents are mentioned to defend the safety and security of the small shopkeeper.The larger players in the retail market must be closely monitored. It is the duty of the Government and the legislation. Superstores should be watched carefully as many of these businesses are very aggressive in the market. They will be involved in practices that will hammer the smaller businessman. With regard to the manner in which staff are treated, I commend the credibility and integrity of smaller shopkeepers and business people in looking after their own staff, paying them well and providing a good local service.On the other hand, some stores do not treat their staff properly. I mention the case of Joanne Delaney in this regard. Ms Delaney had worked in the Dunnes Stores in Crumlin and was sacked by that supermarket for wearing a union badge in the workplace. She is a shop steward for Mandate, the union of those working in shops. She was recently suspended from the job and she has now been sacked. Mandate is attempting to defend her case. It represents 40,000 workers in the retail and bar trade, including staff at Dunnes Stores.I am horrified to see such action against a person for such a trivial issue as wearing a union badge. I strongly support Mandate in this case. Brendan Archibald, the national official for Mandate, has explained there are well established mechanisms available to Dunnes Stores and operated by the union which have been repeatedly bypassed by the company during this process. The decision by Dunnes Stores to sack a member of Mandate for wearing her union badge is symptomatic of a wider campaign by the chain to undermine the union and systematically erode its right to represent its members effectively. For a considerable period, it has been clear to Mandate that the company has wilfully and methodically sought to obstruct the union's efforts to engage with the company on a variety of issues. This is just one example of the company's deplorable attitude to trade union and labour law in 2006. Issues such as this have contributed to the souring of the industrial relations environment in Dunnes Stores. The company continues to ignore the principles of natural justice and the Labour Relations Commission code of practice on disciplinary procedures as they work to isolate and destroy the union. Unless this matter is dealt with satisfactorily from the union's point of view it has the potential to escalate, given the worst atmosphere in the company's history.We are discussing the retail sector and an employee who works in that sector. We cannot allow such a situation to develop in the retail and shops industry in 2006. It is important for the Government to listen to the debate and to the concerns raised by all Deputies.In terms of the detail of the legislation, the departmental report on which the Minister and the Government based their decision to introduce the Bill contained a number of errors and mistakes. This misinformed the Minister and the Government. For example, Germany has a ban on below cost selling but the report states it does not. Second, suppliers will not be able to use existing laws to enforce credit terms but the report states they will. A ban on below cost selling is practical but the report states it is not. Selling below the cost of goods purchased does not take place in other sectors but the report states it does. The Competition Bill will not prevent predatory pricing but the report states it will. Finally, the report asks why the rate of inflation has diverged so dramatically from that of the United Kingdom in the past nine years but there are clear and simple answers if the authors of the report had only looked at them. Why, for example, is UK inflation higher than Irish inflation in the past two and a half years when the United Kingdom has no ban on below cost selling? That is the question that should have been asked.The report also omits to mention that UK supermarkets are subject to a code of practice but Irish supermarkets, if the Bill is passed, will not be subject to such a code. The UK Competition Commission recommended that supermarkets with a market share above 8% should not be permitted to open new supermarkets within a specified distance of their existing supermarkets. The successful entry of Aldi and Lidl was made possible by the ban on below cost selling.Removing the ban will bring about selling of alcohol at below cost which will encourage alcohol consumption. However, at times, people go over the top about the subject of alcohol. Before we deal with the problem of alcohol in society we should first accept responsibility ourselves. We should not blame the people who sell it or who are involved in the industry. The vast majority of Irish citizens enjoy alcohol in moderation and get on with their lives. They do not get into problems. Those who are involved in anti-social behaviour already have other issues. People should come into the real world and start accepting responsibility. It is a shame that this constant theme persists about people. We must, however, be vigilant about our young people, give them a healthy attitude to the enjoyment of alcohol and teach them how to drink it sensibly. If they can do it in France or Spain, where every young person has a positive attitude to alcohol and has no problem handling it when they reach their teens or early 20s, I do not see why we cannot do it. If our parents, who grew up in Ireland in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, could give us a healthy and balanced attitude to alcohol I do not see why we cannot do so in 2006. I say to society to stop blaming the world, accept responsibility and deal with these issues.For the year to November 2005 Ireland had the lowest rate of food inflation in the eurozone and in the 15 member EU and the second lowest in the 25-member EU. These are recent figures, which I raise because we are dealing with competition, food, shopkeepers, small businesses and large superstores. It is part of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 but also part of the broader debate on the direction we are going. In 2006, some feel less equal than others and, for all our talk about equal rights, a significant minority living in Ireland have not achieved legal, economic or cultural parity. The economic, political and cultural disadvantages suffered by these people are serious violations of justice. It cannot be disputed that the Ireland created by the Celtic tiger is a much more prosperous one. We all accept that but prosperity creates dilemmas of its own. Contemporary society displays proliferation of many interests — individual, social, environmental and medical — each demanding a fair share of society's resources. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be enough resources to meet all those needs. There is no easy ethical blueprint to which society can refer to establish that all its obligations have been justly discharged. In the context of difficult decisions about the distribution of resources awkward questions need to be put. How is the tension between the rights of individuals and the overall good of society to be resolved? What are the relevant inequalities that justify giving more resources to some and less to others?We need to balance the rights of the individual, the good of the other and the common good but how, in Ireland in 2006, are we to attain the correct balance? To date we seem to be failing a substantial minority of our population. I do not say that lightly and it is not a question as to the rights and wrongs of competition. I favour competition but we must not lose control or balance. Nowadays the debate is not about creating a wealthy society because we have a wealthy country. Now it is about how we distribute resources, the extra that we have. The challenge for all political parties and Members of the Oireachtas is to ensure the weaker sections of society get the biggest boost from the Celtic boom and our economic prosperity. That must be the priority or there is no point in saying we believe in equality, justice and fair play.I welcome the opportunity to have this broad and wide-ranging debate on the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005. There are many issues I did not get to. There are major flaws in the legislation. I will stand by the working man and woman of this State. I will stand by the small shop against large vested interests and by the community. I urge the Minister to listen to this view.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. As with much of the legislation ushered into the House in recent times, it has one eye on the issue, another on the electorate and another on the impending election date.I am not as impressed as many on the other side of the House by the presentation of this Bill. It is here to encourage the public to believe there is a deep and serious concern on the part of the Government for competition and a reduction in prices for the consumer. Nothing could be further from the truth. It reminds me of the run-up to the last general election. The same Minister who is introducing this Bill abolished the health boards, to resolve the problems in the health services. Those of us who remember that can only ask what was the real purpose of that exercise.Notwithstanding that the legislation needed updating, its format and the manner in which it was introduced is nothing more than a smokescreen to divert public attention from unrecorded inflation and to pretend the Government is concerned about the impact on the consumer. The consumer is now a much sought after personality and is mentioned at every opportunity, as if he or she matters. The consumer does not matter in this country and is the last person thought of at the end of the line. The consumer is the one who pays the piper through the nose every time. The unfortunate consumers, waiting at the end of the line and having shouldered the burdens of Government taxation and broken promises, have their heads on the block once again.Let us look at the changing scene for retailing in this country. Like it or not, due to the planning policies of local authorities and for other reasons, we have arrived at a situation where most towns and villages will no longer possess any shops. The many obstructions which prevent consumers from purchasing goods where they want means that not many retailers will remain in this city in a few years' time. Consumers are being forced to the new shopping complexes on the north, west and south sides. I do not know whether that is deliberate policy or merely represents indulgences on the part of planners, who should have seen that the lack of adequate parking and convenience for consumers would cause shopping centres to move away.A feature of today's marketplaces brought to my attention by people who shop on a regular basis is that it is not unusual for certain lines of groceries and household goods to disappear from shelves for a couple of weeks at a time. Why does that happen? The groceries order attempted to address these issues and this Bill purports to do likewise. I put it to the Minister of State that products are taken off the shelf to muscle suppliers into providing better deals. In reply to anybody who says this does not and cannot happen, I say that it can and does happen when major retailers develop excessive muscles. I do not know what research has been conducted by the Department on this matter but this legislation is supposed to address practices such as hello, goodbye and how are you money.After discussing similar problems ten or 15 years ago, we decided the groceries order was a necessary measure. The entire retail structure has changed since then, some say for the better and others for the worse. It is becoming rare to find the owner of a filling station and say hello or to meet the same person on return visits. The previous relationship between customer and retailer has gone. That is fine in the great conurbations but I wonder whether the people of rural areas have a competitive service which is of benefit to consumers.In the area of telecommunications, the consumer is at the end of the line. There is much talk about mobile phone services and competition, but competition works in every country in Europe except here. We have the most expensive and least effective service in Europe. That is crazy in this free marketing time when competition should be encouraged. There is something wrong with what we are doing and, while I do not know whether adequate research is being devoted to finding out the cause, application needs to be made in that area because it will soon be too late. The quality and standard of our service will degenerate to such an extent that we will become a laughing stock. If anybody believes I exaggerate, they should make the comparison for themselves.In terms of the nationwide delivery of broadband, there were supposed to be 500,000 customers two years ago, yet we have half that number today. It is crazy that a concept we were led to believe in is not delivering. The mechanics of the marketplace need to be carefully examined and questions need to be asked about why we are not delivering to the consumer.As we live in a time of low interest rates, every utility service in the market, whether toll road or telecommunications system, is an investment house. They are better than banks because they make money on a regular basis. Once again, the poor old consumer is at the end of the line, bearing the burden and coughing up every time more is clapped on.In recent days, the Minister for Transport appeared on television, looking like he wanted to be elsewhere, and announced that tolls will be lifted from the M50. The impression was given that we would eliminate the blockages in the system and allow the traffic flow along the road. The consumer thinks about this for about 12 hours, only to find a slight problem. What the Minister really meant is that he wants to snare more unfortunate consumers so that they cannot get on or off the M50 without being screwed to the wall and having the money extracted from them whether they like it. We should be protecting the consumers whose contribution to the Exchequer amounts to €5.2 billion and will rise to €6 billion next year.The little old consumer that so concerns this caring Government sits on the M50 for two or three hours, if lucky, and pays tolls and taxes. In return, he or she has to face four obstructions where there was previously one. Those obstructions are not yet fully designed and——

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Inasmuch as entertainment is concerned, I often thought that the guys opposite should go on stage because they would attract full houses every night and the audience would fall out of their seats with laughter because every time they heard from the Government, they would say to themselves, "Well, the consumer was a victim of the Red Cow roundabout and the Luas." Consumers will be victims evermore of the port tunnel because, although tunnels were built throughout the world 150 years ago, Fianna Fáil could not even build a simple one and, when it was built, we discovered it was too small. Still they think they would not draw a crowd on the stage but I can assure them they would get full houses every night. There would be no need for comedians because they would provide all of the comedy. Incidentally, these are only minor details. I could give a long list of other areas where the unfortunate consumer has been fleeced. When the time came — we are getting nearer to an election, no doubt about it — the Government rose to the occasion. It had a good look at what could be done and decided that while the poor consumer had been hammered sufficiently in the past three or four years, there was no harm in having another go. It sent a smoke signal and there was a fudge but it hammered the consumer again.I have referred already to the changing face of shopping. On a related issue, we have a reasonably large market, with a relatively good turnover and it should not be the case that competition is between suppliers as opposed to retailers. Retailers are concerned with market share. Retailers will always assert that their main concern is service to the consumer, but in actual fact it is market share. The essential presumption, articulated in the context of the discussion of the groceries order, is that the majority of supplies to the various trades come from indigenous suppliers. That is the way it should be but that is changing. If one looks carefully at the origin of goods, one will find vague references to the European Union or labels stating that the goods were processed or packed in Ireland. These are various ways of misleading the unfortunate consumer, who might unwittingly assume a product originated here, generated jobs here and was part and parcel of our economy when in it might only have been packed here.With regard to what will happen from now on, it would serve the Minister well to keep a close eye on prices in all of the retail outlets, given that the purpose of the exercise was to produce cheaper food for the consumer. The consumer expects to receive a boost in the form of cheaper food. Let us see how it works and how it has worked, for instance, since last November, with the abolition of the groceries order. How beneficial has it been to the consumer? The answer is zilch, it has made no difference at all, but it could have a serious impact on market share from this day forward. Will the Minister indicate to what degree his Department can monitor the fluctuations and trends in the trade, particularly with regard to market share? To what extent will the inspectors be able to monitor the demand for "hello" money? There is more than one way of getting around that provision, which I am quite sure the Minister of State knows about.

However, I do not see any evidence to support that assertion. I have no doubt the single most important reason for the introduction of this Bill, the debate leading up to it, the heart wrenching hand-wringing, the tearing of hair and the gnashing of teeth in the Department — one could almost feel the hurt and pain of the Minister as he examined the nuances of the legislation — was the forthcoming general election and not any concern for the consumer or the retail trade.I have already referred to changes in our cities but now wish to briefly refer to changes in the towns. There was a time when there were small shops and small supermarkets on the streets of every town and village. They are disappearing fast, either because they are unable to compete with their bigger rivals or as a result of the planning process. We will shortly arrive at a situation where all that is left on the main streets of towns and villages are offices and traffic lights. If the Government persists with its traffic lights policy, getting into those offices will be more difficult than getting into this House.The most important thing I want to see emerging from this process is consumers benefitting in a real way and not simply in a way that meets the propaganda requirements of an election.

The removal of the groceries order is a grandiose gesture, calculated to pander to the gallery rather than put more money into the pockets of consumers. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment described the demise of the groceries order as a "liberating day for competition policy in Ireland". I will believe that when I see people heading off to the sunspots of Europe with the fruits of the lower prices that the multiples have decided to give them, but that day will be a long time coming.The major multiples, both Irish and multinational, will continue to alternate their loss leaders from week to week, with the aplomb of circus jugglers. It is interesting to see how there are special offers in Tesco in one week and in Dunnes Stores the following week. It is an ongoing saga and people should see it for what it really is.It is all very well to trumpet the abolition of the groceries order as a lifting of the ban on below-cost selling, if one does not happen to be the owner of a small shop. Often such shops have been in families for generations and, that is what rural Ireland and the towns of Ireland are all about, family-owned businesses passed on from generation to generation. Such small shops grow over the decades into larger shops, perhaps becoming a local supermarket. Families put money into them, building extensions and offering greater levels of service. The personal touch is evident in the services provided to customers, having changed little from across the counter service. By linking up with local chains such as Londis, Centra, Spar, SuperValu or Mace, the shops could compete with multiples and even beat them in some areas. This is welcome.The "Tescopoly", where every little can hurt, is generally within walking distance in most towns. If Britain is any guide, it will crush many of the small, independent grocers. The massive purchasing power of the multiples in Britain, added to the lack of constraints on below cost selling, sounded the death knell for many small shops. It is a complaint in many British towns that it is not possible to get milk or bread at night because the small shops had been swept away. Once they forced the local shops to close and shoppers were left with no choice but to shop in large out of town centres, the prices increased.The groceries order was introduced in 1987 by the then Minister, Albert Reynolds, after the H. Williams group collapsed following a lengthy price war. It was seen as a solution at that time but since then more than 2,000 small grocers have gone out of business, with most of the remainder seeking refuge in symbol chains like Spar and Mace. These 2,000 retailers were self-employed, family business people who provided a service but they were wiped out.The major British multiples entered the Irish market, with Tesco and Marks and Spencer making major inroads within a few years. Much of the distribution to these major multiples is done directly from Britain and the invoice price is set outside the country, presenting problems here. The goods are then imported at a price below the invoice price in Ireland. This must be constantly monitored because such companies can find ways to get around our pricing structure and to make special offers.The contribution of small retailers cannot be overstated. They are a vital part of society's fabric. The convenience and flexibility of going to a shop near the house to buy bread or milk is invaluable. These shops belong to us and we must make a conscious effort to support such enterprises. It is a major advantage that we do not have to queue at a checkout for more than ten minutes to pay for the groceries and that we can walk in and out without getting a trolley. People should value their time and, while no one should be directed into small shops, we should make a conscious decision to use them. It is not uncommon for parents to run out of milk or bread late at night and the small shop's role in meeting such needs is important. If we do not support them, they will not be there the day we need them and by then it will be too late to complain.The small shop is a community hub, where people meet after mass, pick up the newspapers and lottery tickets and hear the local news. Deputy Durkan referred to the changed landscape in most towns. In one town in Monaghan where there used to be ten shops 15 years ago, not a single shop is left. That has been replicated in every town. Some town centres are dead, with people only going to multiples in shopping centres, leaving other businesses struggling. My neighbours in Cavan experienced the same difficulty, with the small, family-run business in the town centre suffering. Many town centres are semi-derelict but those derelict buildings were thriving businesses a few years ago.Previously, in many small housing developments, an integral part of a new community was a small neighbourhood centre which included local shops. Some emerging communities now are bereft of shops, leaving a gaping void that is often not filled for many years. Many people are unable to set up their own businesses and boost the local economy by providing valuable employment. In these areas community is a misnomer because a community looks after its members, with a shop and post office offering self-sufficiency. New housing developments have lost that and there is no way to get to know the neighbours with no local shops or sense of community. These estates are simply collections of commuters where people do not know their neighbours. This starts the breakdown of community spirit because the chatting that once went on is now absent. People have no way of getting to know each other.The groceries order included a ban on so-called "hello" money, upfront payments from suppliers to ensure their products were carried by supermarkets. There are ways around that and that should be addressed. The order attempted to ensure retailers would not receive any benefit from a supplier for advertising the supplier's product. Suppliers are prohibited from discriminating against any retailer in the terms and conditions under which goods are supplied and suppliers are not permitted to coerce retailers in any way by threatening to withhold supplies. The order importantly required large purchasers to pay their suppliers on time and to adhere to the published credit terms of small businesses and suppliers. Cash flow is a vital aspect in business and unless it is properly managed, a business might not be able to survive, no matter how profitably it trades.Many book stores and supermarket chains have adopted the practice of selling three items for the price of two. This is in conflict with the below cost prohibitions of the groceries order. It is vital to ensure that another below cost price war does not break out between the major multiples and Irish suppliers. There is a danger that some of the major multiples may take a strategic decision to go below cost to appear competitive for a short period in the knowledge that they will blow away the opposition. They can take a short-term loss for long-term gain. These issues should be examined. This will put at risk the jobs of people working for supermarkets and retailers.The purpose of this Bill should be to protect the rights of the consumer and ensure where possible that savings that can be made through national distribution are passed on to the customer. Competition is the lifeblood of trade. Permitting small shopkeepers and entrepreneurs to open and carry on business is of paramount importance, as is the availability of choice to the consumer. While it is argued that competition is good for the consumer, unfortunately the small corner shop is virtually extinct and currently accounts for only 10% of the retail sector. The market share of the multiples will grow relentlessly as they continue their below cost onslaught on the market. In the long run, if the scale of their international purchasing clout is allowed to continue unfettered, the rest of the market will not stand a chance, with consumers being nailed to the wall. If Irish consumers wish to consort with the likes of Tesco or Wal-Mart, in its guise of the British ASDA chain, it will cost them much more than the €1,000 they will supposedly save in the next 12 months.Legislation and regulations will not make a real difference. Ultimately, the onus is on individuals to recognise the bigger picture and make a conscious decision to support small corner shops. Not long ago we sought to try to save rural post offices. If most people were to examine their consciences, they would probably find they have not bought a stamp in a local post office in many years. With post offices and corner shops disappearing before our noses, it is vital we support our local businesses.

At one point he told us he seeks a pragmatic outcome, namely, lower prices, while in virtually the same breath he informed the House he wishes to protect retailers from aggressive pricing tactics. Perhaps he knows how to reconcile both views but I am unable to do so.Deputy Hogan informed us he has a plan to boost the resources of the Competition Authority in order that it can be a real force working on behalf of consumers. He then rejected out of hand the authority's view of competition law and dismissed its comments on the groceries order as worthless. Perhaps he wishes to double its resources so that he can disagree with twice as many of its decisions.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The Deputy claimed he will support a facility which will allow discounts and rebates to be passed on to consumers rather than putting the money into the pockets of retailers. While this view is commendable, he later rejected the provision of the Bill which will have precisely that effect. The Bill removes the incentive for the trade to operate a system of discounts and rebates in the first instance. The Deputy has asked the Minister to indicate what part of the legislation will ensure that consumers will be able to access such discounts and rebates in future. He cannot have read the Department's report if he asks such a question. The part of the Bill the Deputy seeks is section 4(1) which reads: "The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 (S.I. No. 15 142 of 1987) is revoked". The order encouraged and facilitated off invoice discounts and specifically prohibited retailers from passing them on to consumers. Getting rid of the order is a major step towards getting rid of that problem but evidently the Deputy did not draw this conclusion.Deputy Hogan is also wrong to state the Department's report indicated there was no evidence that the abolition of the groceries order would lead to lower prices. I will cite the report to clarify this matter. It states:We would expect that the impact of the resulting competition in the market would be to bring about decreases in the retail prices of goods covered by the Order.However, we don't believe that it is possible to predict in any meaningful way the precise extent of such price reductions. Ultimately, that will be a function of a variety of factors including the amount of off-invoice discounts that are available for transfer back to the invoice, the actual level of net margin obtaining in the retail trade currently, and the extent to which resulting competitive forces will drive efficiencies at all levels of the production and distribution chain.Other extraneous factors, including input costs and consumer demand, also impact on retail prices and make it difficult to isolate the impact of any one factor such as the ban on selling below net invoice price.Deputy Hogan criticised the Minister on the basis that there was no sign of a new chairman being appointed to the Competition Authority. I am pleased to note that less than 24 hours later, the Minister announced the appointment of Bill Prasifka to the post.

It is interesting that the measure of objectivity in this matter is whether one agrees with Deputy Hogan. It is unfair to characterise a contribution to the debate as less than objective because the person who makes it happens to hold an informed view.Deputy Hogan accused the Minister and Department of ignoring the valid concerns of anti-poverty groups, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Crosscare and the Combat Poverty Agency, notwithstanding the fact that a full chapter of the Department's report is primarily devoted to the submission these organisations made to the public consultation process. The concerns of these groups are based on the fact that consumers in areas of economic deprivation have little choice other than to shop with symbol group operators and small independent grocers which, in turn, limits their access to healthy foodstuffs. The anti-poverty groups want the multiples to be attracted into such areas to provide the competition and choice needed. I agree with this proposition and fully support the anti-poverty agencies in pursuit of this objective. It does not make sense, however, to argue against abolishing the groceries order on the grounds it might encourage the multiples to compete more aggressively with the symbol group operators. This is a case of being damned if one does and damned if one does not. One group argues we must keep the order to ensure competition from the multiples, while other groups argue we must keep it to protect against such competition. Between these arguments we have Deputy Hogan who somehow manages to support both of them.

We are told groceries cost more here than in the United Kingdom because we have higher input costs such as rents, wages, insurance and so forth. If such costs are higher here, this will be the case regardless of what product one is selling and, as such, any divergence in the rate of inflation between here and the UK should be viewed across all retail sectors.

A factor other than input costs is driving the disparity in food prices between Ireland and the United Kingdom.Deputy Howlin cited evidence given to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment by representatives of Aldi and Lidl, in which they indicated they could not have opened in Ireland had it not been for the groceries order. Apparently they stated they would have been devoured and killed off by Tesco and Dunnes Stores. How does the Deputy explain the presence of both discounters in the UK market where all the evidence suggests they are enjoying a period of strong growth?Almost all retailers try to attract customers by claiming to offer prices which are lower than those charged by the competition. That is the nature of business. In general the consumer is free to judge which retailer offers the best value. Aggressive pricing is not uncommon in highly competitive markets. Many low fares airlines have an aggressive pricing policy. We all know people who have travelled to the UK for 1 cent.

Not all aggressive prices are predatory. Why should we assume that a supermarket that charges low prices or engages in aggressive pricing is trying to put the opposition out of business? Aggressive pricing is fair and is designed to attract customers and win market share. It benefits consumers and encourages businesses to be efficient and deliver value for money. Predatory pricing is different. It is the unfair and deliberate use of market power to put people out of business. In regulating competition in any sector of the economy, it is critical that we distinguish between the two. We must be able to determine when the line between aggressive and predatory pricing has been crossed.The key distinguishing feature of predatory pricing is that it is unfair and deliberate misuse of market power. Competition law provides a mechanism to measure this unfair and deliberate misuse of market power. It is a persistent and prolonged sale of a product below cost by a firm that is dominant in its market. If we reject this measurement, we reject the distinction between aggressive and predatory. If we reject the measurement, we will prohibit valid low pricing strategies that benefit consumers and the economy as a whole. That is why the concept of predatory pricing by a non-dominant firm is a contradiction in terms. When it comes to deciding whether a firm is dominant, competition law does not specify the geographical boundaries of the relevant market beyond saying it can be in the State or any part of the State. We will have the opportunity to address the issue in greater detail on Committee Stage. For now the strength of the law on dominance is its flexibility and ability to be adapted to each set of circumstances.

A firm with a large market share might not be considered dominant if because of other factors it is not in a position to exercise power over the market. Similarly if all the other criteria pointed to market power, a firm with a small market share might be considered dominant. If we change the law to say that a firm with a 30% market share is automatically dominant and one with less than that is not, we will eliminate the flexibility and destroy the law beyond redemption. Worse, we would run the risk of destroying all vestige of competition in the economy.Deputy Howlin criticised a former chairman of the Competition Authority for his preoccupation with price and said that price is not the be all and end all.

Deputy Eamon Ryan said the groceries order was not a major reason for the lack of competition in the market. No matter how often the Deputy repeats that statement, it will not make it true. The groceries order was the principal contributing factor in driving price competition out of the grocery trade after 1997. By creating a convoluted mechanism of discounts and rebates, it allowed suppliers to fix minimum prices below which most grocery prices could not be sold. Deputy Eamon Ryan flies in the face of the economic evidence on that score.The Deputy also claimed the groceries order protected a form of retailing that he characterised as the corner shop. We cannot allow the outcome of a debate as serious as this to hinge on such misinformation and spurious claims. In 15 years after the groceries order was amended in 1987, more than 20% of the independent grocery stores in this country closed.

Can the Deputy point to even a handful of new, small and truly independent stores that opened in the same period? The order did not protect small retailers in the manner he claimed. Neither did it protect suppliers who were faced with secretive, arbitrary and discriminatory demands from retailers. Those demands were not just facilitated by the order but were positively encouraged by the convoluted way in which the provisions and supplementary terms had been drafted.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Off-invoice discounts and rebates in the grocery trade did not just happen because some suppliers and retailers thought it might be a good idea. It happened because while the order allowed suppliers to have their principal terms and conditions of trade about which they had to be open and transparent, which is fine as far as it goes, it also allowed them to operate a system of supplementary terms, keep them a closely guarded secret and negotiate them in an arbitrary way. If that were not bad enough, the order also did not require suppliers to put those supplementary terms on the invoice which meant the retailer was not allowed to pass them on to the consumer.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	287	That successive Governments supported for 18 years.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	288	——that protected certain elements in the trade from having to face up to competition. It did not protect the small, independent grocers, who were squeezed out of business by the practices encouraged and legitimised by the order. Deputy Morgan described the groceries order as a ban on below-cost selling. Even the most ardent supporters of the order admit that it was not a ban on below cost selling. Deputy Morgan should have read the Department's report on this issue before debating the order.The Deputy also referred to planning laws and while it is not in our area of responsibility, I want to dispel the notion that the groceries order prevented the opening of large hypermarkets. It had nothing to do with this issue and suggestions to the contrary cloud the debate. While our planning laws must be framed in a sensible, reasonable way that allows proper, sustainable retail development that encourages fair competition, I do not want to see planning laws used to protect existing business from the introduction of the type of competition that would facilitate easier access to cheaper, healthier food, particularly for the less well-off.I return to what some Deputies have referred to as the core issue in this debate, the prohibition of predatory pricing. We have been told that existing laws are not strong enough. This is not entitled the Competition (Amendment) Bill for nothing. When enacted it will be part of competition law. Such law is only concerned with low prices on two conditions, namely, when prices are so low as to have no economic justification and when the firm in question has sufficient market power to be able to use such uneconomic prices to put other firms out of business. When prices meet those conditions, they are considered to be predatory and such conduct is already prohibited by the Competition Act 2002. Opposition Deputies have advocated a law that prohibits predatory pricing by non-dominant firms. They want a law that prohibits all low prices regardless of whether such prices are part of an attempt to put somebody out of business. Such a prohibition has no place in competition law and this Bill. When we tried to operate such a law in the past, it did not work. It was called the groceries order.Deputies have spoken on rip-off Ireland and the high cost of groceries here compared with the rest of Europe and have bemoaned the lack of competition in the market, but when the chance comes to do something about it and take the bold step——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Very bold.

Replacing it with the same law under a different guise will not work. We must encourage low prices, not demonise them. We must not try to scare consumers into thinking low prices are bad for them.I was taken aback by the number of references in the debate to the report by the consumer strategy group. It was suggested more than once that the decision to revoke the groceries order has been based on a recommendation by that group. Deputy Lynch referred to it and Deputy McHugh repeated the assertion at least three times in the course of his contribution. Both were wrong. The Government's decision on the order was made on the basis of a detailed review and analysis by the Department which was published last November. The Deputies would have spent their time more productively by reading the report and concentrating less on the report of the consumer strategy group.

It is his analysis that it is flawed. Not only was the CSG report not the basis for the decision on the order, but the CSG never argued that the order should be removed because our grocery prices were higher than in other European countries. The CSG report stated that the order should be removed because it had resulted in grocery prices that were higher than they otherwise might be, which is a very different concept. This assertion was borne out by the detailed analysis carried out by my Department as part of a subsequent public consultation process. If Deputies opposite me and even some of my own colleagues had spent more time reading my Department's report they would understand better the harm the groceries order was doing——

Deputy Ó Caoláin might not have been so quick to assert that the groceries order banned predatory pricing and below cost selling. The Deputy was wrong on both counts as the order did neither.He might also have avoided stating that the order banned price fixing, by which I presume he was referring to resale price maintenance. The order not only legitimised the practice, but made it inevitable by prohibiting the sale of grocery goods at a price less than the price on the invoice.

If Deputy Lynch had read the report, she would know that unfair pricing by a company in a dominant position is predatory pricing. Deputy Lynch also stated that the Minister said that every household in England now lives within four kilometres of a petrol station with a convenience store attached. Had she read the report, she would know that the Minister stated that almost 90% of rural households in England live within four kilometres of such a facility.

It seems a long time ago that statistics were widely used to scare customers into believing that getting rid of the groceries order would result in a similar situation in the country. The statistic was dropped like a hot potato when my Department's report proved it to be a complete fallacy.I thank the Deputies who made valuable contributions. I will pass them on to the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I am sure there will be a wide-ranging, informative discussion on Committee Stage.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	308	It is absurd to state that there has been a dramatic increase in headline crime for 2005 when the level of headline crime for 2005 is 4.4% lower than the level for 2002. I did not hear the Opposition Deputies state that there was a dramatic fall in headline crime when there was a decrease of 3% recorded for 2003 and a further decrease of 4% in 2004 compared with 2003. Since I took the decision to publish crime statistics on a quarterly basis at the beginning of 2003, I have consistently emphasised that care must be taken in interpreting the statistics, especially when considering short-term fluctuations and extrapolating trends over short periods.I will briefly discuss long-term crime patterns. The level of headline crime in 2005 is lower than that for 2003 by 1.6% and for 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore, in 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population. That is a significant decrease in the level of criminality in our population.Our crime rate continues to compare very favourably with those of our nearest neighbours. In England and Wales, in the year April 2003 to March 2004, the most recent year for which figures are available, 113 crimes were committed per 1,000 population. In 2004-05 in Scotland there were 86.3 crimes per 1,000 population and in Northern Ireland there were 69 crimes per 1,000 population compared with our rate of 24.6 per 1,000.Moreover, there have been significant reductions in 2005 in the incidence of manslaughter, down 50%; aggravated sexual assault, down 43%; robbery of cash and goods in transit, down 27%, which reflects in part the changes made as a result of the intervention with the cash in transit industry; robbery from the person, down 23%; and theft from the person, down18%. However, I am not complacent and the overall increase in recorded crime and the increases in particular categories in the most recent figures published are disappointing. I am not down-playing my concerns in that respect.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I welcome, however, the significant decrease of 27% in the number of incidents of robbery of cash and goods in transit, down from 62 in 2004 to 45 in 2005. This trend improved in the fourth quarter, with a decrease of 47%.Operation Delivery, an initiative undertaken by the Garda Síochána to counteract the increase in cash in transit robberies which emerged in 2004 has contributed significantly to this welcome decrease. The code of practice put in place by the major financial institutions and security companies has dramatically improved the situation. I took a direct hand in bringing about the requisite partnership approach among all those involved in the industry to ensure that decent standards were applied.Deputy O'Keeffe raised the issue of the number of crimes committed by people on bail. In the 2004 report the Garda Commissioner, for the first time, published the number of offences committed by perpetrators who were on bail. In the term of the rainbow Government the number of prisoners on temporary release reached an all-time high of 20%. It is now 2.3%. That is an important figure.With regard to the people who have been specified by the Garda Commissioner as having committed offences while on bail, it should be borne in mind that these are gross figures. We do not know, for example, whether they were serious offences on which the perpetrators were out on bail at the time they committed the offence which is dealt with by the Commissioner's report. We are not told that by the figures. We will study the figures to ensure that this issue is dealt with.A bail Act was passed on foot of a referendum. Under that legislation, gardaí are now entitled to oppose bail for persons who are charged with serious offences on a number of grounds, including the gravity of the offence and the likelihood of bail being abused to commit a separate, serious offence. The gardaí continue to apply to courts in serious cases not to grant bail where they believe, in line with the statutory criteria, further offences are likely to be committed. They are not always successful in those applications.

However, I am also concerned about the crime epidemic. My first concern is that the Minister does not appear to accept that we have an enormous problem with crime. It is difficult to envisage a solution being found until there is an acceptance that there is a problem. The Minister quoted various statistics selectively. Has he forgotten the statistic that in 2000 the figure for headline crimes was 73,000 and the figure for last year was 40% more? There are lies, damned lies and statistics.Will the Minister accept that there is a huge problem? Will he discuss, reasonably and sensibly, what we can do about it? I believe we must put in place various measures such as adequate numbers of gardaí, proper technology and changes in the criminal law. None of these is in place. We have been given promises, commitments and plans but these do not prevent or help in the detection of crime. We must deal with the situation as it is. Will the Minister accept that we have a problem and that we must bring forward and expedite the promises, commitments and plans or this epidemic will continue?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Of course, I regard crime as serious. However, the phrases used in the questions to which I was replying, that there had been a dramatic increase and that crime was spiralling, are simply not true. Since 2000, the numbers have gone down both in absolute and relative terms. They are significantly down per head of population. I simply made that point.My second point relates to responses to crime. The number of gardaí has risen dramatically. The Deputies opposite will probably not want to remember that when they were last in office, they allowed the numbers of gardaí to fall. Since the two parties now in Government came into office, there has been a significant increase in the number of gardaí. Numbers have reached 12,200 as planned and will increase to 14,000, in training or fully qualified, by the end of 2006. It is not a matter of promises being made-——

Class sizes vary between 275 and 300 to bring us up to the 14,000 as promised. This will be delivered by the Government.The Garda Síochána Vote this year increased by 13%, at a time of 3% inflation or less. That is a significant increase in resources. This was on top of an increase last year and the previous year. These increases are unprecedented. On Garda equipment, the force is about to get the digital radio equipment that has long been spoken about. I will deliver that and roll-out of the equipment will start this year. With regard to other equipment such as cars, helicopters and the like, the Garda Síochána has never had as much resources as it now has. This year a sum of €82 million or €83 million has been provided for overtime, a significant increase on anything available previously.This year's budget for the Garda Síochána is €1.29 billion, a 13% increase this year. The money spent on increasing numbers and providing for equipment, Garda stations and international liaison centres etc. has never been higher. I now want to put in place the Criminal Justice Bill which will give gardaí requisite powers in a number of areas. I look forward to the co-operation of Members in seeing that legislation through.

The actual number of gardaí in the force today is what is relevant, not the numbers for next year or the year after and not the number of student gardaí. What counts is the number available today.Future plans for technology will not affect what is happening today. Is the Minister satisfied with 20 year old walkie talkies? Is he satisfied with a PULSE system which does not operate properly and which costs €1 million per month in consultant's fees to keep it going?Does the Minister not accept that the Criminal Justice Bill appears to be collapsing under its own weight? We will need a wheelbarrow to bring around the Bill and the amendments from his office — we have only seen the heads of those amendments — and the proposed amendments from the Minister with responsibility for Children. Is there not a case for withdrawing the Bill and dividing it into manageable proportions in order to get the legislation through the Houses quickly? I am concerned that this Dáil will be over before the Bill is in place, judging by the lack of progress.

If I was to split the Bill into different parts, we would require long Second Stage debates on each part. As the Deputy appreciates, that would guarantee no progress would be made in the lifetime of this Dáil on these important matters.

The problem is that while there has been a 3% increase in the overall statistics in 2005, there has been a dramatic increase in the most serious and violent headline crimes. Murder is up by46%. If that is not a dramatic increase, I do not know what is. Rape section 4, serious rape, is up by 33%. Burglary, which is the largest category of all, is up to 26,000 reported burglaries, an increase of 6%. Possession of drugs for supply or sale is up by 20% and possession of firearms is up by 16%. If we add to these figures the number of gangland killings last year, the increase is 250%.What do we mean by dramatic? The Minister must face reality. What makes matters worse and is even more dramatic is that in the past three months of 2005, overall headline crime increased by 10%. What will happen in 2006? It is time the Minister recognised the reality. If he does not and does not realise he has a problem, he cannot tackle it. The Minister's problem is that he does not even recognise he has a serious problem in headline crime.The most serious category of all is murder through firearms. The detection and conviction rate for this is abysmal. Only 16% of convictions were for the murders committed over the past five years, an abysmal detection rate. We have the lowest detection and conviction rate for the most serious crime. Criminals realise that they can commit that type of crime with impunity.The Minister stated that he will take significant steps to deal with the dramatic increase in crime. What are those steps? Operations Crossover and Anvil have not succeeded and we have the figures to show that. They may have succeeded in dealing with other crimes, but not with the dramatic increase outlined by these figures. Operation Anvil operates on the basis of Garda overtime. This means the Minister expects tired gardaí who have already done a day's work to come out again to try to deal with the most serious crime of all, gangland crime. The Minister must build into the Garda plan on an annual basis, outside of overtime, an approach to dealing with headline crimes. Otherwise he will not deal with them at all. If he does not get a grip on reality and face up to what is happening, how can he expect to reassure citizens that he is in charge?

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	370	That is wonderful and the reason we are not getting the 2,000 extra gardaí. It remains the case that the Minister has not faced up to the serious crime problem, whether it involves murder, gangland killings, anti-social behaviour or drugs. Drug trafficking is one of the most serious issues and is now out of hand.A question has been tabled on cocaine. We saw in a recent survey that cocaine use is now so ingrained in Irish society that the Garda is finding it extremely difficult to target the problem. This happened under the Minister's watch because cocaine was not readily available in the country when he became Minister. Since he took office, cocaine has spread to every town in Ireland.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	372	Heroin still presents a serious problem in Dublin. Some 85% of all heroin seizures are in Dublin and the problem has not really spread outside the Dublin area. However, cocaine has spread to every part of the country under the Minister's watch. He is doing nothing about it. Crimes associated with cocaine, including crack cocaine, are becoming the most serious of all crimes and I have not seen any proposal by the Minister to deal with the problem. Perhaps he will tell us today on the floor of the House what he intends to do about this threat.

I want the Minister to at least listen to what I have to say. I was horrified by the recent statistic that 15 of the people who died in violent circumstances last year were alleged to have been killed by people on bail. Urgent action is necessary on this front. We need a tougher approach to bail. Has the Minister proposals in this regard, either by way of changing the law such that previous convictions would have to be taken into account by a judge before deciding on a bail application or by way of some change in presumptions regarding people with previous convictions for violent crime?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	376	As the Deputy knows, the Bail Act has been enacted. All the aforementioned criteria are relied upon regularly by the Garda. Whether the Judiciary feels the applications by the Garda to withhold bail are correct is a matter for it to decide. I share the Deputy's apprehension that the bail referendum and Bail Act introduced on foot thereof do not seem to have a reforming effect on circumstances in which serious evidence given by serious gardaí in court is sometimes overruled or set aside. Bail is sometimes granted in the teeth of serious opposition by members of the Garda.

Huge amounts of cocaine have been seized and these seizures influence the figures on which Deputy Costello is relying to point out that the issue is not being dealt with. He keeps asking whether I accept that crime is serious. Of course I do — I am serious about my job.

However, the Deputy will appreciate that the law in the State is very extensive and includes constitutional provisions, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004, the Human Rights Commission Acts 2000 to 2001 and the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. There is also extensive support by way of the Equality Authority, Equality Tribunal and the Irish Human Rights Commission. The policy of the Government in the area of disability equality is represented by the establishment of the National Disability Authority as well as the Disability Act 2005.The promotion of these Government measures, both legislative and administrative, follows on the Good Friday Agreement in large measure. As indicated in my reply to Question No. 1046 of 28 September 2005, it is Government policy for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement to be implemented.

Does the Minister of State accept that in 1998, when the Irish people cast their vote in favour of the Good Friday Agreement, they correctly believed and expected that the rights protection won under the Agreement, and in particular promoted by Sinn Féin in its negotiations on the Agreement, would extend to and benefit them all? Does the Minister of State agree that by whittling away equality protections and refusing to entertain the notion of a rights based society, he and the Government are trampling on the expressed will of the people?The Minister has seen the report but has he read it? It is quite detailed and useful. The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, should read it. They might then understand some of what equality organisations have been promoting in recent times and the criticisms directed at the Minister. When will the Minister deliver the long overdue acts of completion that would ensure that this State would have at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as that stated in the Good Friday Agreement? Does the Minister of State agree with the finding that the Government has failed to deliver on its commitments under strand three of the Agreement?The foreward to the report refers to limitations within the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003 and limitations in the scope of the Irish equality legislation as it relates to disability, public function, political opinion and enforcement and remedies, limitations in the treatment of transsexual people and gay and lesbian people in this State and the absence of positive duties to promote equality.

I do not accept that there are any significant shortfalls in equality legislation in this part of the island in comparison to Northern Ireland. I reject completely the proposition made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. We have in place effective and established protections which provide for and promote equality in the workplace, in the provision of goods and services and on nine discriminatory grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. We have legislation underpinning this framework, which I have outlined in my reply. The scope of our equality legislation is broader than the equivalent in Northern Ireland — there is no argument about that.The essence of the point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh is that any initiatives introduced in Northern Ireland should automatically be introduced here. I reject that proposition outright.

By rejecting my point, he is rejecting the findings on which the representatives of the Equality Authority and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, Mr. Bob Collins, Karen Erwin, Evelyn Collins and Niall Crowley signed off. Their report specifically refers to: "The need to address limitations in the scope of the Irish equality legislation as compared to equality legislation in Northern Ireland". The report then details these limitations under headings related to disability, public function, political opinion and enforcement and remedies. These are the words of the representatives of the Equality Authority and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland pointing out the failures of the Government and the State. Will the Minister read the document and perhaps come forward with amending legislation to ensure that we at least have equivalence with Northern Ireland in this regard?

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I am informed by the Garda authorities that while there has been an increase in the seizures of freebase or crack cocaine in this jurisdiction over the past three years this represents a small proportion of the total number of cocaine seizures recorded annually. However, the Garda authorities also inform me that most of the recorded seizures of freebase cocaine, particularly in the past two years, have been in the north central division of the Dublin metropolitan region — the area represented by Deputy Gregory.This is a matter of significant concern to the Garda authorities, which have taken a number of measures to address the problem. The Garda national drugs unit and local drug units are conducting intelligence-driven operations to target individuals suspected of involvement in the distribution of freebase cocaine. Drug units and community policing personnel are engaged in intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of the drugs. I thank the local community for the work of its many activists to help the Garda in that regard. There is also targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.The national drugs strategy 2001-08 addresses the problem of drug misuse across a number of pillars — supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research — and the implementation of the strategy across a range of Departments and agencies is co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Government is aware of the increased prevalence of cocaine usage in recent times and efforts to tackle it are broadly based to include measures aimed at both supply and demand reduction, including awareness initiatives.The fact that most of the arrests have been carried out in the Deputy's constituency shows that there is a particular local issue and that the area is effectively a base for the distribution of crack cocaine, not merely in the city but in Ireland. It would be idle of me to pretend otherwise than that it is a particular community within the Deputy's constituency which at the moment specialises in this area — I do not want to go any further than that because I do not want to be accused of fanning flames. However, in so far as immigrants are engaged in this trade, they should be under no illusion but that if they are convicted or apprehended, or if they come to attention in any other way, the power of deportation will be used aggressively and vigorously to counter this threat.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	400	My purpose in raising the question was to highlight a specific problem, which the Minister outlined in his reply, which is of immense concern, particularly to local community activists who are involved in trying to counter the drug problem in the north inner city. Is the Minister aware that seizures of crack cocaine have occurred almost on a weekly basis in the north of the city since October last? The locations of the seizures are spread across the north city, from Moore Street to Phibsboro. However, while drug seizures are increasing, they usually represent only 10% to 15% of drug activity. This indicates that there is a complex network of crack cocaine dealers operating in the area.To some extent, the Minister's reply has gone some way to addressing the issues I wanted to raise. I want to be assured that he is taking all steps to have this specific problem assessed and to ensure the correct strategy will be put in place to deal with it before it escalates. If crack cocaine spreads to drug users generally, we will have a major crisis on our hands. The community policing forum in the north inner city, in which I am involved, has been working with the local Garda drug unit on this issue. One of the forum's suggestions is that an inter-agency group composed of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda drugs unit, immigration authorities and the community be put in place. Many of these seizures have resulted from intelligence from the local community, which has been working with the drugs unit under the umbrella of the community policing forum.I know the Minister appreciates how serious this issue could become if crack cocaine were to spread. Is he aware of evidence showing that crack cocaine is being sold outside the particular grouping specialising in it? There is evidence that it is beginning to spread to drug users who would have used other drugs in this area. This development is causing considerable concern to all those in the north inner city who have made considerable progress with the help of the Garda drug unit in dealing with the problem of heroin and other drugs. If crack cocaine spreads through the north of the city, it will be very difficult to deal with. At this stage, we have an opportunity to assess the problem of crack cocaine, develop a strategy to deal with it and prevent it from spreading. Will the Minister support the suggestion by the community policing forum in the north inner city that the various specialist agencies which have an input in this issue due to its specific nature be combined and a strategy for dealing effectively with it produced?

It is important that there be an inter-agency response and that all State institutions dealing with this problem have a focused and clear view of the problem when it is present in a relatively confined place before it escapes out of the area where it is now located and becomes endemic.It is not generally understood that crack cocaine is far more potent and addictive than ordinary cocaine. It is far more damaging to human health and leads to the risk of blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, damage to the heart muscle and damage to lungs. It is also frequently associated with psychotic episodes and very violent and alarming behaviour is associated with its use. I do not doubt that what Deputy Gregory said is essentially correct.Anyone who thinks it is applicable to them should bear in mind that there is no right to engage in this activity in this country under any circumstances. The status of people who have visas to remain in Ireland as a result of the Irish-born children scheme or on another basis is conditional on their upholding the law. If I find it appropriate in any particular case, based on information available to me, to withdraw the right to remain in Ireland and to deport the people in question, I will do so. I will not be dissuaded by humanitarian concerns which are disproportionate to the damage caused by this trade.

Any section of the community which believes that the Government will be a pushover on this issue will find that the opposite is true. I agree with Deputy Gregory that in the same way as the Criminal Assets Bureau involved different groups ranging from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the Revenue Commissioners to the Garda, it is necessary for the immigration authorities, social workers, the drugs programme, the Garda and the local community to combine to produce a focused result to stamp out this problem.

Part of his duties with the embassy included the delivery of evening courses in Turkish language and culture at Trinity College. As the individual's salary was paid by the Turkish Embassy, he was not registered as belonging to the Irish labour force.The person who is the subject of this question was permitted to remain in the State while her father was in the employment of the Turkish Embassy. When her father's assignment with the Turkish Embassy ceased in late 1997, she sought and was granted permission to remain for study purposes until October 1998. Since that date, the person in question left the State and re-entered at different times on study, employment and C-visit visas and was granted permission to remain on various occasions on student, work permit and visitor conditions.An application for permission remain pursuant to Article 7 of the Turkish Association Agreement was submitted to the immigration division of my Department but as no evidence was provided to indicate that her father was duly registered as belonging to the labour force of this State, the application in question was rejected.It is noted from documentation submitted to the immigration division of my Department that the person concerned most recently entered the State on foot of a C-visit visa on 4 October 2004. These visas are issued for a maximum of 90 days and individuals in possession of this type of visa cannot have their permission to remain in the State extended. It is understood also that the individual concerned is registered as being in employment but without an employer having first obtained a valid work permit.The person concerned is, therefore, illegally resident in the State and must leave the State and re-apply should she wish to return. Her new visa application should include the purpose and duration of her intended stay. It is open to her to get an employer to secure a work permit on her behalf which, if granted, would enable her to commence a period of legal residence in the State.

In 1994, he then transferred to Trinity College and worked as a lecturer there for five years. His daughter came to Ireland as a young girl in 1994, attended Oatlands College secondary school, went on to study at University College Dublin, qualified, entered the Irish workforce and travelled to and from Turkey. In the meantime, her father returned to Turkey following the termination of his course at Trinity College in 1998 and is now mayor of a large city in Turkey. The young woman has been granted temporary residence permits over a period and faces the same situation again.Why was her father not considered to be part of the Irish labour force during the five years in which he worked for Trinity College? If he had been recognised as a member of the Irish labour force, it would have entitled her to residency. I have letters from Trinity College describing her father's work. One letter certifies that: "Mr. Selcuk Dulkadiroglu who has been teaching our Introduction to the Turkish Language and Culture course since its inception in 1992, is again teaching the course in the 1996-97 school year".

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	424	As the Deputy is aware on 24 January last, the Government agreed that work should get under way on the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill to provide for the establishment on a statutory basis of a DNA database. I expect to publish the Bill later this year.The Criminal Justice (Forensic Science) Act 1990, which provides the statutory basis for the taking of DNA samples only permits the examination of samples with regard to particular offences. The value of a DNA database, over and above our current system, is that it will allow profiles derived from samples taken from individuals to be analysed against all crime scene samples, regardless of when the crime took place. By doing so it will offer greater possibilities to identify perpetrators of crime. It will also contribute to the more efficient use of Garda resources. I am therefore satisfied the establishment of a database will make a significant contribution in the fight against crime. This has been the experience in other jurisdictions where databases are already in operation.I am on record in this House as favouring the establishment in this State of as extensive a DNA database as possible subject to constitutional and ECHR obligations. However, having regard to the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved, I considered it appropriate to await the outcome of the Law Reform Commission's examination of this issue, including the level of safeguards to be included before proceeding with plans to establish the database. As the Deputy is aware, the Law Reform Commission published its report in November last year.I have paid close attention to the commission's recommendations, but there are areas in which I will go further than what was suggested by the Law Reform Commission. In particular, these will relate to the category of offences for which DNA samples may be taken. I have consulted the Attorney General and I do not agree there is a human rights dimension to a policy of destroying samples taken after a particular period of time. This is not justified, for example, with regard to the Criminal Justice Act 1984 and the issue of fingerprints. Similarly, it should not be the case for DNA samples to be destroyed after a period of time. That is an example of the State disabling itself in the proper investigation of offences.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I have paid close attention to the commission's recommendations when preparing the proposals that have now been approved in principle by Government. I am sure the Deputy will understand that certain matters are still subject to detailed scrutiny. However, I assure him that my proposals will incorporate the following key safeguards. The database, while being extensive will be subject to certain operational restrictions to take account of civil rights issues. By that I mean it will include the DNA profiles of persons convicted of serious criminal offences, including those placed on the sex offenders register. It will also include profiles from samples taken from persons who have been detained on suspicion of involvement in serious offences. In addition, it will include profiles generated from samples provided by "volunteers" as well as those taken for the purposes of identifying missing or injured persons.With the exception of profiles relating to missing and injured persons taken for identification purposes, it will only be possible to use DNA samples taken in connection with criminal investigations in the context of the investigation of crime — they will not be used for or made available for other purposes, such as the determination of paternity or in the assessment of health risks by, for example, the insurance industry.With regard to the provision for the giving of samples by volunteers, their informed consent will be required. Profiles taken for the purpose of identifying injured or missing persons will be held in a separate index on the database and will not be speculatively searched for the purpose of criminal investigation against the profiles from crime scene samples held on the database. It will be an offence to disclose information or to receive information about samples or profiles other than in accordance with the legislation.The storage of a person's profile on the DNA database will have no implications for a person in terms of employment, travel and so forth. This is because access to the database with be restricted and controlled and the information stored on it will not be generally available or known other than to those needing to know in the context of a criminal investigation. Anyone whose profile is stored on the database will have a right to make an application to have it removed and destroyed together with the sample from which it was generated.The DNA database will be operated by the Forensic Science Laboratory. The laboratory operates under the aegis of my Department. My proposals will include provision for statutory oversight arrangements by suitably qualified persons to provide assurance, in the interests of transparency and public confidence, that the highest standards are being maintained. These statutory oversight arrangements will include independent accreditation and the development of codes of good practice.While my proposals for the most part closely reflect the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission they do depart from those recommendations in certain respects, particularly the retention of samples taken from suspects and the establishment of an independent statutory agency to operate the database. The commission's report recommends that samples and profiles should be destroyed where they relate to persons who are detained on serious offences but who are released without charge, or who, if charged, are subsequently acquitted or otherwise discharged.The Attorney General has advised that retaining indefinitely samples and profiles taken from suspects in these circumstances is not unreasonable and does not constitute a violation of any legal rights, once clear and strict safeguards are provided against the misuse of the samples and profiles. I share that view and, as I have already indicated, I will ensure that comprehensive safeguards and limits on access will be provided for. Accordingly, my proposals will provide for the indefinite retention of all samples subject to the right of every individual, as I have already mentioned, to apply to have his or her profile and sample destroyed.With regard to the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that an independent agency be established to operate the database, I consider that the Forensic Science Laboratory, which, as I have said, operates under the aegis of my Department, is well placed to undertake the task of operating and managing the database. I do not, therefore, propose that a new agency should be established for that purpose. I accept, in the interests of transparency and public confidence, that oversight arrangements by suitably qualified persons are desirable to provide reassurance that the highest standards are being maintained. Therefore, as I have indicated, I intend to provide in statute for an independent oversight body. I believe this approach will meet the need for independent verification of the work of the laboratory and will facilitate the early commencement of the new arrangements.

Does the Minister agree there is real concern that if these samples are held for an indefinite period, and if they apply to any crime within the State, there is a danger they would be used for incorrect purposes?This may occur if a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform put out information that has not been through the law courts. I can think of a recent example of this. In essence, does the Minister not believe there should be some time limits on the retention of DNA samples? Does he believe that clear guidelines should be put down with regard to what type of crime would result in DNA samples being taken and retained? Does the Law Reform Commission recommend that safeguards similar to those recommended by the Human Rights Commission be put in place in the form of guidelines or a code of practice for the use of DNA samples?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I do not advance the view that every offence, no matter how trivial, carry the onus to extract DNA from a suspect. With regard to parking or other summary offences, I cannot imagine any reason why it would happen. There are other categories of offences that should not be the subject of a compulsory power to take such a sample.Generally, in the case of indictable crime, a person arrested should be obliged to provide a DNA sample. Although I am grateful to the work carried out by the Law Reform Commission, I respectfully disagree with it on the following point. I do not believe civil liberties are enhanced by the destruction of a sample of DNA, for example, two, three or four years after it has been obtained. It would be a case of the State disabling itself in the battle against crime to carry out such an action. Recently I became aware of a case where a person was convicted of a serious crime using old evidence, many years after the offence and after the trail had apparently gone cold.It is not simply a matter of getting convictions on DNA evidence tendered in court. One major advantage of DNA and the dramatic manner in which the technology is changing is that it gives gardaí leads almost immediately at the scene of a crime. People leave traces of DNA if they use a door handle to get into a building, if they carry a briefcase or if they go over objects in a bureau, for example. Traces of DNA left behind are very helpful to the Garda Síochána in such circumstances when it is able to match samples to those of known offenders and those who have been arrested previously for serious offences.

We are virtually the only country in Europe that does not have a DNA database, and the sooner we have it, the better. My concern is to get it as quickly as possible. An 18-year-old murder was solved with this technology. Some 6,000 crimes from the past four years in England have been investigated using DNA evidence, and these include murders and attempted murders. We should proceed with this database.I have two problems. I am concerned that there has been such a small increase in the budget of the Forensic Science Laboratory, which indicates that not a whole lot will be happening this year. With regard to legislation, will the Minister give a timetable on when we will have it? Will he give an assurance that it will not be heaped into the wheelbarrow with other amendments to the Criminal Justice Act, as it is already vastly overloaded? I guarantee my party will do what it can to make sure the legislation is put in place quickly. We badly need the operation of this database.

I agree with the Deputy that this is a very important area of science and criminology. I am working at the moment on an ambitious programme to give the Forensic Science Laboratory, an important State service, a new home, and to do so as rapidly as I possibly can. I hope to provide facilities in a secure location in the Phoenix Park Garda complex, as part of a building programme, as speedy as the one responsible for the four-storey building that was erected in Templemore, and to expedite the transformation of the Forensic Science Laboratory into an institution with every possible technical and housing requirement fulfilled.I also intend to provide for the proper storage across Ireland of samples and evidence because, at the moment, the Garda Commissioner and I have misgivings about the circumstances in which some evidence is kept. I assure Deputy Jim O'Keeffe that this is a priority, though I have not had the opportunity until now to indicate so. It is something on which I, the Commissioner and my colleagues in Government are anxious to make early progress.

I hope he will do the same for other evidence brought before the courts which at present is retained in Garda stations but not under proper lock and key.Is the Minister satisfied that we have sufficient expertise, an adequate methodology and sufficiently cutting-edge modern technology for the testing of DNA samples? In nearly every controversial case that comes before the courts we seem to have to go abroad for DNA testing. Do we have the resources and sufficient staff to conduct the sampling and provide a proper database ourselves?

Does he intend to include in the legislation a provision that samples given voluntarily by citizens to aid elimination from investigation will be destroyed? If not it will discourage people from aiding the State in its pursuit of crime and will impede investigations.

Sinéad McDaid was killed on the side of the road on 12 June 2001.

I am not in a position to do so and it would be inappropriate to act in the manner the Deputy invites me to.I agree that the basis on which people volunteer information or a sample should not be abused. If they are led to believe that what they volunteer is to be used solely for the purposes of one particular investigation then that should happen. They should not be tricked into providing a sample for another purpose. Informed consent is the keynote for persons who volunteer samples.Samples should be taken from people arrested for serious offences, namely, those carrying a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more. They should also be taken from people charged with a number of offences carrying lesser penalties, such as indecency or under age sex.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána is capable of operating the expanded fixed charge and penalty points system when it comes into effect on 3 April 2006. In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the fixed charge processing system, using hand-held machines which currently process the offences of speeding and the non-wearing of seat belts, is operational nationwide from today. This system will, in April, cater for the additional 31 fixed charge or penalty points offences recently announced by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. This will result in a significant reduction in the number of court appearances for gardaí, freeing them up for operational duty and removing a burden on the courts. In conjunction with this, the payment collection service being provided by An Post is being piloted and will be rolled out nationwide on a phased basis. By April 2006, this service will be operational in all Garda districts, removing the need to pay these fines at relevant Garda district headquarters. When the An Post service is fully rolled out, payment will be possible at 900 locations nationwide.On the question of increased resources for the Garda traffic corps, as a result of the Government's approval of my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, the Garda Commissioner will be in a position, as each cycle of recruit training is completed, to assign additional new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities.An Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Eddie Rock, was appointed on 22 February 2005 to head up the corps. Between now and 2008, the traffic corps will increase its numbers to 805 in 2006, 1,030 in 2007 and a full complement of 1,200 in 2008.It is intended that by the end of the first quarter of 2006 the number in the traffic corps will have increased by 60 and will thereafter increase by a further 60 each quarter to reach a total complement of 805 at the end of 2006.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Members who may or may not be in the Garda traffic corps in 2008 will not be able to do anything about the carnage on our roads now. It is tiresome to listen to the Minister talking about plans and commitments for years ahead when the problem is there now. My complaint is about the numbers in the traffic corps and that, despite commitments that were made three or four years ago, efforts are only now being made to produce the extra recruits. Does the Minister accept that there is scepticism on the part of the public about the operation of an expanded penalty points system? There have been four offences in the system for some time and their operation to date does not inspire much confidence.A number of questions have been put on whether the technology is in place to deal with another 31 offences. Will the Minister explain, in simple, layman's terms, how the system will work and how it will be better tomorrow than it was yesterday?

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that an outsourced payment collection system, integrated with the PULSE system, is being put in place and will be operational on 3 April 2006. The Deputy is a bit behind the times in terms of PULSE.

By the end of the roll-out, it will be possible to pay for penalty points in every post office. Fixed penalty points will be recorded on a person's licence and, in the event of the fine being unpaid by the end of the relevant period, warning notices will be automatically sent out, followed by court documentation, with a court date selected as part of a simple process. That took more time than I was happy with but the system is now in place and the 31 additional offences will become live on 31 April.Gardaí will be supplied with a hand-held computer the size of an old mobile telephone, on which they will be able to record and electronically download details to the system so that there will no longer be a need to process as many forms or for people to carry pencils behind their ears. It will be an entirely automatic process.

A crisis, therefore, exists and the Minister assures us it will be addressed. We do not have the 1,000 strong dedicated traffic corps he promised us. More than 1,500 gardaí are sitting behind desks and doing work that could be done by civilians, the highest percentage of any police force in Europe. He has done nothing about that, despite his commitment in 2002 to deal with it as a priority. We have 31 new penalty point offences, yet these do not include using hand-held mobile telephones while driving a car. When will the Minister address that issue? This is another bit of old guff from himself and the Department of Transport.

It cannot be denied that the number of deaths on the roads has climbed relative to an exponential increase in the number of cars.

I appreciate his point that on-line payment is a sensible way to deal with the matter.On the remuneration basis, I understand that a fee per item basis is being contemplated. That is the only way An Post can incentivise post office owners and managers around the country. It will not be a question of giving people incentives to hand out tickets for cash, however.I will not excuse one road death, let alone the appalling figures of recent months. The State must play its part in ensuring proper enforcement of road traffic law and the Garda Síochána has to do that with the resources it has been provided. Every citizen also has a duty to co-operate with the Garda Síochána.

I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Seán Ryan.The Minister of State may have heard about the latest saga concerning Temple Street hospital. Plans have been ongoing for at least the past 20 years to do something about the dilapidated buildings and the poor conditions under which staff are working and to transfer the hospital to a new campus within the grounds of the Mater hospital. Five acres of land have been earmarked for this and everything was prepared. The money was earmarked in the national development plan — originally a sum of €400 million was earmarked, although estimates have since risen to €500 million. The lion's share of the money has been earmarked for a number of years.Temple Street hospital and the Mater hospital were told they could go to tender on the project, which they did. They received tenders but then a bolt came out of the blue and they were told they could not open the tenders because a review of tertiary paediatric services was being instituted and that nothing could be done until that review was complete. They were further informed that this review would require an amount of consultation down the line and, inevitably, the project was long-fingered and there is a possibility that it will not go ahead.Now we are hearing rumours and suggestions that a new greenfield site will be acquired in the Tánaiste's constituency, which would house all paediatric services in the country. It is an absolute scandal that €46 million has been spent in preparation for the development and that money may be totally lost. It is also a scandal that Temple Street hospital should be allowed to remain in the condition it has been in for such a long time. It is not good for patients, parents or staff. It is a further scandal that at the 11th hour, when everything and everybody was prepared, the Minister should pull the plug. This issue is as big as the PPARS scandal and far more money is involved. The money that has already been spent could be totally lost. It is unacceptable and unconscionable that business would be done in this manner. I ask, in support of the staff and parents, who have had a number of meetings and put a number of statements and letters into the public domain, that the project proceed and that the decision that was made some time ago be progressed.A letter was sent to the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach by Dr. Timothy Lynch, chair of the division of medicine, consultant neurologist and chair of the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association, on behalf of the staff of the Mater hospital, seeking a site in the Mountjoy complex when that becomes available for rehabilitation facilities, a stroke unit and accident and emergency facilities. He argued that the existing facilities in the Mater hospital are inadequate and extra land is needed. I ask that Dr. Lynch's request be treated sympathetically.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The children from north Dublin, north county Dublin and the rest of the country are being treated in Victorian conditions in Temple Street hospital. The existing facilities are totally inadequate, leading to major queuing, discomfort and lack of privacy. The proposed new hospital, which has been on the agenda for approximately 25 years, will resolve these problems and must be commenced immediately. Our children are being used as pawns in an internal debate within the Health Service Executive as to the preferred location for tertiary paediatric services and this must cease immediately.Parents are fortunate that the staff at the hospital, notwithstanding the conditions, are continuing to carry out their professional duties in such a caring and dedicated manner, in the interests of the children. Parents, staff, consultants and doctors at the hospital are totally opposed to the delaying of the project, seeing it merely as a stalling tactic to allow the HSE to examine alternative sites. Families throughout north Dublin, as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Glennon, will know well, are suffering.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be raised. I wish to deal with three issues pertaining to a particular credit union but which are of interest to every member of a credit union, including myself. Whistle-blowers may wish to report a matter that is not in accordance with the code of ethics for credit unions. That code for directors of a credit union board and the effectiveness of the regulator charged with overseeing the proper implementation of the legislation governing the running of credit unions must also be addressed. The Minister should take on board this matter and outline the mechanisms open to any member or members of any credit union board who become aware of a possible conflict of interest for any other member or members.The Minister should examine the reported failure of arbitration at St. Joseph's Aviation Credit Union and ensure the issue is urgently investigated and resolved in the interests of the credit union itself and the good names of the whistle-blowers who are frustrated with the lack of progress in this matter.This is not a new matter, as the Minister of State knows. In October 2005The Sunday Business Post reported:The former president of a credit union that is being investigated for improper practices had resigned because he could no longer continue "defending the indefensible".[This individual] resigned from the board of St. Joseph's Aviation Credit Union in June.The credit union — which has 18,000 members in branches in Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports — was last week instructed to stop selling insurance products after the Financial Regulator became concerned about management practices.The credit union has €120 million in assets.[This individual] said he could no longer associate himself with the running of the credit union. "I have to hold my hands and say I defended the indefensible . . . It took me five years, but I just could not stand over it anymore".He said he was "disappointed and upset" with the regulator and Registrar of Credit Unions, whom he accused of failing to act on information he had provided about improper practices at the credit union."The majority of people on the board are decent people," he said.The majority of the board members are frustrated to the point of despair and wonder if the State has any concern for their plight. The issues they are bringing to my attention, with reports of attempted fraud, misuse of members' funds and using the position of credit union director in a conflict of interest, need urgent resolution for the continuing normal operation of the credit union.The whistle-blowers in question should be protected. This is a matter being debated worldwide. Sharon Watkins, the former vice president of Enron and the world's best known whistle-blower, was chosen by the World Council of Credit Unions as its keynote speaker on the subject of identifying wrongdoing and fraud in financial institutions such as credit unions. She strongly argues that the credit union movement must be vigilant in this area.Credit union board members in their work life must have a more comprehensive code of ethics with which they must comply. The Minister for Finance must take note of this and I ask him to address it in line with other reform being considered for the 1997 Act. The Irish League of Credit Unions is also seeking reform of that Act. The example highlights the need for reform of the code of ethics and the need to enforce it to control the minority who flout it.The regulator visited the St. Joseph's Aviation Credit Union and has all the relevant documentation. Instead of interviewing each of the 15 board members and the three supervisors, however, he set up an arbitration board. The Fingal Independent has reported that this process is likely to fail. In the event of failure, the Minister must ask the regulator to carry out the direct interviews with each board member so the credit union can return to working on behalf of its 18,000 members and have this cloud lifted.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	506	I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance. A number of specific legal provisions are in place under section 69 of the Credit Union Act 1997 to address issues of a conflict of interest that might arise in credit unions. Under section 69(3) of the Act, individual board members of a credit union are obliged to declare any possible conflict of interest to the board of directors of the relevant credit union. It is open to any member of a credit union who is concerned at a possible conflict of interest in a credit union to bring that issue to the attention of the board.As for the arbitration process undertaken in the dispute at board level in the credit union referred to by the Deputy, the Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible within the financial regulator for the regulation of credit unions. He met the board of the credit union in November of last year and proposed the appointment of an arbitrator to undertake a formal process of arbitration on the issues dividing the board. The registrar's proposal was accepted by the board and a senior counsel was appointed to undertake the arbitration process.Unfortunately, the arbitration process has not been successful. The Department has been informed by the Registrar of Credit Unions that the arbitrator will shortly withdraw from the process. Following the completion of the arbitration process, the registrar will undertake a full investigation of the affairs of the relevant credit union. On foot of the outcome of that investigation, the registrar will take any steps that are necessary to resolve the issue using the regulatory powers available to him under the Credit Union Act 1997.

The person in question is a migrant worker who was working here until September 2005. Owing to personal circumstances she had to change employment and is now seeking further employment. She would be an ideal client for an employment scheme while in receipt of family income supplement at some stage in the future. This person has at least one child and is living on charity at present.It is sad that someone who has worked here and paid contributions and whose circumstances change is no longer wanted by us and must go back home. I do not blame the Minister of State but it is a shame his colleague, the Minister with responsibility for the area, did not reply to this matter. I would be interested in hearing his reply. We all deal with countless cases of this nature, some of them heart-rending, involving people who are very vulnerable, in a difficult situation and in need of a helping hand. We pride ourselves on our charity and our economy but this case deserves the personal attention of the Minister.The woman applied on 7 November for one-parent family allowance and, two months later, on 16 January, she received a reply to her application. The letter stated that it had been decided that she did not satisfy the condition of being habitually resident in the State because she had not resided in the State or part of the common travel area continuously for the past two years. She did for 18 months. The letter further stated she had no stable pattern of employment in the State. That is not true. She has been employed since she has been in the State. The letter continues that she has resided outside the State all her life. Given that this applies to many people currently in the State, I have serious doubts about the validity of this response. The letter further states that she has retained links abroad by way of retention of a financial account. If all those Irish people who went abroad and retained financial accounts here were treated in such a fashion, we would be very upset. I ask the Minister to consider this.The letter further states that the future intentions of the woman in question with regard to the length of her stay here are short term. That is debatable. I know people can be inspired and the Minister of State, the Chair and I will have met many of them but I do not believe inspiration would be sufficient to make such a determination given that one does not know what will be a person's circumstances in future.The letter then states that, from the evidence provided, there is nothing to substantiate that the woman in question is habitually resident in the State. Based on the statements made in this letter one would wonder whether the person truly exists. I would have asked that question if I had not had the woman introduced to me by another individual who was aware of her circumstances and pleaded with me to find out if anything could be done to secure a social welfare payment for her to tide her over the immediate problem until efforts could be made to secure a place for her on a community employment scheme.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	508	As Deputy Durkan pointed out, I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan. The habitual residence condition was introduced on 1 May 2004. There is a requirement on all applicants for certain social assistance schemes, including one parent family payment and child benefit, to satisfy the habitual residence condition to access the payments. The objective of the condition is to restrict access to social assistance and child benefit in the case of persons newly arrived in Ireland, who have little or no connection to this country.The Government introduced a habitual residence condition for access to social assistance payments with effect from 1 May 2004. All applicants, regardless of nationality, are required from that date to be habitually resident in the State to qualify for these payments. The term "habitually resident" is intended to convey a degree of permanence and to refer to a regular physical presence enduring for some time, usually but not always beginning at a date in the past and intended to continue for a period into the foreseeable future. It implies a close connection between the applicant and the country from which payment is claimed and relies heavily on that fact. The most important factors for habitual residence are the length, continuity and general nature of actual residence, rather than intention.Any applicant, regardless of nationality, who has spent most or all of his or her life in Ireland should satisfy the habitual residency condition. Generally an applicant who has been present here for two years or more, works here and has a settled intention to remain in Ireland and make it his or her permanent home will also satisfy the habitual residence condition. An applicant who satisfies the habitual residence condition must also satisfy the other conditions of entitlement to receive the payment claimed.Section 208A inserted by section 17 of Schedule 1 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 provides that: "it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that a person is not habitually resident in the State at the date of the making of the application concerned unless he has been present in the State or any other part of the Common Travel Area for a continuous period of 2 years ending on that date".There is a presumption that an applicant for any of the relevant payments is not habitually resident in the State at the time of the making of the application until the contrary is shown by him or her. The onus is on the applicant to prove that he or she is habitually resident in the State. If it is proven that he or she has been present in Ireland for two years or more, an applicant does not attract the presumption of not being habitually resident. This does not mean an applicant is automatically considered to be habitually resident in the State because he or she has been in Ireland or another part of the common travel area for two years or more.Depending on the facts, it may still be necessary to investigate further before deciding that a person is habitually resident. However, it is likely that most applicants who have been in Ireland for more than two years prior to the application for one of the specified payments will be habitually resident here in the absence of indications to the contrary. Persons who are not habitually resident at the time of the application for one of the specified payments may become habitually resident by the time they make a later claim for the same payment or another of the specified payments.While the legislation requires a person to be continuously present in Ireland or elsewhere in the common travel area for two years, a short holiday of, say, two to three weeks is accepted as not breaching the requirement to be continuously present in Ireland or the common travel area. Residence is more a settled state than mere physical presence. A person must be present in Ireland at the time of making an application for the payments concerned.The European Court of Justice has set down a number of factors to be considered when considering whether someone is habitually resident. The Deputy touched on these in his analysis of the form. The court determined that five factors are relevant in determining whether a person is habitually resident. It also stressed that the following list of factors is not exhaustive and should not be used as a means of scoring points for and against a person satisfying the condition. No single aspect is consistently likely to be the deciding factor but some may be more persuasive in certain circumstances than in others.The five factors are: applicants' main centre of interest; the length and continuity of residence in a particular country; the length and purpose of absence from a country; the nature and pattern of employment in a country; and the future intention of applicant concerned as it appears from all the circumstances. The checklist of questions or factors which needs to be considered is not exhaustive and further inquiries may be needed. The circumstances of each case will dictate what information is needed and it is vital that all relevant factors are taken into account. The evidential weight to be attributed to each factor will depend on the circumstances of each case.A deciding officer is appointed pursuant to statute or in the case of the supplementary welfare allowance officers of the health Service Executive who are duly authorised to determine entitlement decide whether a person satisfies the habitual residency condition. The officers have due regard to the five factors outlined and any additional information elicited by way of further inquiries. As provided for by law decisions can be appealed to the independent social welfare appeals office or, in the case of the supplementary welfare allowance, to the relevant HSE appeals officer and, if subsequently necessary, to the independent social welfare appeals office.The person concerned made an application for one parent family payment in November 2005. Her case was referred to the habitual residence unit of the Department for a determination on her habitual residence in the State. A deciding officer has determined that the person concerned did not satisfy the habitual residence condition as she had not resided in the State or common travel area for the past two years or more, has had no stable pattern of employment in the State and does not intend to remain here in the long term. The person concerned was notified of this decision and the reasons for it on 16 January and informed of her right to have her case reviewed by the deciding officer and her right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office. According to that office an appeal has been registered in respect of the person concerned.

As the Minister is aware, water meters are being installed on all non-domestic premises across the country. This process has been ongoing in County Sligo for some time because it was one of the original pilot counties selected. However, some issues have arisen which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister and on which I will seek his advice.With regard to the cost of the water meters, a decision by Sligo County Council fixed a charge of €80 per water meter. The county manager originally proposed a charge of €150 but the figure was subsequently reduced by county councillors. The legitimate question has been asked why, given that we do not pay to have ESB meters installed, we should pay the cost of having a water meter installed.The second, perhaps most important issue to arise, concerns members of the farming community. I have been approached by many farmers in recent weeks. As I stated, water meters are being installed in all non-domestic premises. However, in the case of farmers the meters are being installed on their domestic water supply. It has been proposed that each farming household would be allowed to use 50,000 gallons of water free of charge and would be charged for any additional water used. Those of us who do not belong to the farming community may use as much water as we wish, from as little as 10,000 gallons up to 100,000 gallons. The valid point has been made forcibly to me that an allocation of 50,000 gallons is a form of discrimination, particularly for a family with more than four children. A family with more than that is being discriminated against. It would be better if the water meter were installed outside the house in the yard, where the business of farming begins.My third point concerns farmers who have multiple holdings. In the west particularly, for historical reasons due to the Land Commission's dividing up large estates, many farmers have multiple small holdings. I met a farmer who has a total of 16 acres split into four different holdings. Farmers are charged €80 per water meter per holding, in this case a total of €320. Compare that with a farmer who has 100 acres in one holding who will be charged only €80. That is not fair and I will be guided by the Minister's advice on what we might do to rectify these anomalies.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I thank the Deputy for raising this interesting issue. Water metering has been widely abused by people who oppose logic. It is a positive thing. The national water services pricing policy framework provides for the recovery by sanitary authorities of the cost of providing water services from the users of those services, with the exception of householders, and the latter point raised by Deputy Devins is interesting in that context. This is consistent with the EU water framework directive. The Government's policy fully respects the prohibition on charging for domestic water services as provided under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997. As far as I am concerned, that will stand while I am Minister. It also requires full recovery of the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector by means of a meter-based volumetric charge and the metering of this sector by December 2006. This policy is being progressively advanced and implemented by local authorities and in general there are positive results from that.Proper metering of the non-domestic sector is important so that pricing of commercial water can be operated fairly and efficiently. Once fully implemented, the national metering programme will facilitate charging on the basis of the actual usage of water. This will be a transparent, fair and equitable method of recovering water services costs and will provide for the treatment of all non-domestic customers in an even-handed manner. The provision of meters will also support and encourage water conservation. An interesting story came from a group water scheme recently. When water metering was mooted, water consumption dramatically decreased because people were not disposed to wasting water. The provision of water meters will support and encourage water conservation. It is supported by business groups, including IBEC and the chambers of commerce generally, which support the principle of universal non-domestic metering.Up to now, there has been a moderate level of metering of water services in Ireland with approximately one third of non-domestic customers, usually the more significant users, being charged on a metered basis. Experience in developed countries suggests that much higher coverage of metering is necessary and feasible. A recent OECD report indicated that countries in Europe with 100% metering, domestic and non-domestic, including France, Germany, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Portugal, Poland and Switzerland, had much better conservation results than Ireland.The national water metering programme, which is at an advanced stage, has been greatly assisted by the co-operation of Sligo County Council and its significant support for the Sligo pilot metering demonstration project. That authority has shown energy and commitment in recognising the need for such a project and in advancing it, and is to be complimented. In 2002 my Department agreed the scope of the pilot demonstration project with Sligo County Council and Sligo Borough Council, with the funding of their client's representative on the project in the sum of €470,000. In the interim this design, build and operate project has developed from planning to implementation phase, which involves meter installation, an operational contract and a billing and collection module. Comprehensive guidance notes have been developed throughout the project. It is important that we have guidance we can use in other local authorities. In this regard three sets of guidance notes have been issued to sanitary authorities and a further final set is planned.A cornerstone of the policy is that all users are charged in the same way. That is just and equitable. My Department has worked very closely with sanitary authorities in developing the charging mechanism and conditions that apply to pricing policy. Some of the points made by Deputy Devins are interesting in this regard. A mechanism for calculating charges which includes operational, marginal capital and administrative costs has been developed and rolled out to sanitary authorities.The unit costs of water to users will vary between different local authorities because of differences in the costs of water production. Water users will rightly be sensitised to the particular unit costs operating in their areas by virtue of the more precise system of charging now to be applied. My Department's guidelines make it clear that less efficient local authorities, which do not have effective water conservation programmes in place, will not be able to pass on excess costs to consumers. Sanitary authorities are restricted to recovering a maximum of 20% of the cost of unaccounted for water where they have not developed and set a targeted water conservation programme. That is an important safeguard within the new system and is a common sense measure to ensure that local authorities prevent water wastage. The Sligo pilot metering demonstration project has been a significant driver in the implementation of the national metering programme and in the general implementation of the water services pricing policy and I commend the Sligo local authority for that.On the final issue raised by Deputy Devins, multiple meter charges, if he gives me details on the case I will examine it. I do not say I can do something about it but the whole idea of metering is that it is just, equitable and reasonable, so if something appears to be unreasonable I will examine it.

Direct provision is the means by which the State discharges its obligations to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers. For the most part, this represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis.Direct provision was introduced on 10 April 2000 and brought Ireland into line with best practice in other member states of the European Union, including the United Kingdom. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum seekers is by far the best approach and I believe the system of direct provision represents a fair and effective means of meeting the needs of this group.Asylum seekers in direct provision are paid €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child per week. These payments were originally in the nature of a basic supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, payment, which was means tested to take into account assessment of any benefit and privilege including full board and lodging provided through direct provision arrangements. All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance, are paid directly by the State.On 1 May 2004, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs introduced an habitual residency condition which prohibited the payment of social welfare payments, including supplementary welfare allowance, to asylum seekers. On foot of consultations between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, it was agreed that some allowance would remain in place for asylum seekers residing in direct provision accommodation. This has ensured that the payments previously made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme have continued to be paid on a non-statutory basis.The Reception and Integration Agency continues to work with the relevant service providers to ensure that supports of a high standard are made available in a sensitive, balanced and cost-effective way to all asylum seekers availing of direct provision accommodation. The payments referred to by the Deputy form a very small part of the overall level of service provided by the State to asylum seekers. There are no plans to alter the current amount.

As a result of the action of this Government, this so-called revolving door system operated by the rainbow coalition has been stopped and the percentage of the prison population on temporay release now is approximately 2.3%.The Garda Commissioner has for the first time provided statistics on headline offences committed by persons on bail in his 2004 annual report. I welcome the provision of this information as a contribution to public discussion. I would point out that with the passage of time, as Garda investigations into crimes committed progress, these figures will change with respect to 2004 and subsequent years as they become available. This is the result of offenders being identified and their status at the time of the offence being ascertained, that is, whether they were on bail or not at the time of the commission of the offence. The most recent figures are set out in tabular form on a table which I am circulating with this reply. This shows that in 2004, 5,306 headline offences were committed by persons on bail; the figure was 5,456 for 2005.These figures require further examination. I have therefore requested the Garda authorities to provide as a matter of urgency a detailed breakdown of the statistics given in the annual report and to provide additional information. Among the matters on which I have requested further information are data on the offences for which the offenders were on bail when they committed the subsequent offence and how many have been convicted of that subsequent offence. I expect to receive the information requested shortly, when it will be examined in my Department. Depending on the outcome of that examination, further research into the figures may be warranted with a view to seeing whether action is required. However, I can make a number of preliminary points.First, the statistics in the Commissioner's report classify offences committed while on bail under the ten headline crime groups under which the report's statistics are categorised. It is important to note that all offences in, for example, the homicide group are not the homicide offences of murder and manslaughter. The homicide group of headline offences also includes the offences of attempted murder, murder threats, infanticide, abortion and procuring or assisting in an abortion.Second, the statistics may include persons who have not been convicted of the offences they are alleged to have committed, and this is one of the matters on which I have requested information from the Garda Síochána. The Commissioner's report gives the number of offences in the homicide group committed by persons on bail as 15 offences. Because of the passage of time which I have just mentioned, this figure is currently 20, as will be seen from the figures which I set out below. These 20 offences are made up of nine murders, one manslaughter and ten threats of murder. There were 37 murders and eight manslaughters in 2004 — a total of 45 offences. These murder and manslaughter cases therefore represent 22% of the total number of murders and manslaughters in the year. While this figure requires further investigation, it is less than the 33% which the figures might appear to indicate at first sight. I would also point out that the figure of offences in the homicide group regarded as being committed by persons on bail in 2005 is also 20. However, 17 of these were murder threats, with the remaining three being murders. There were 58 murders and manslaughters in 2005. Consequently, these three murders represent 5% of that figure. I might also point out that the Garda rules for regarding an offence as having been detected do not necessarily require that a person has been convicted for the offence.I would also point out that, while it is disturbing that offences are committed by persons on bail, that offence for which the person received bail may be a minor one.Our legislative provisions for the granting of bail are very stringent. The Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to the amendment and tightened up the bail regime generally. Furthermore, the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed shall be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence. The granting of bail in accordance with the Act, the amount of bail and sentencing are matters for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.Group Type20042005Homicide2020Assault281232Sexual Offences2632Arson2326Drugs317430Thefts2,8482,914Burglary1,1701,171Robbery305321Fraud224205Other92105Total5,3065,45620042005Abortion00Infanticide00Manslaughter10Murder93Murder Attempt00Murder Threats1017Procuring or Assisting in Abortion002020
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I reject the Deputy's implication that there is any lack of commitment on my part to rehabilitation programmes for prisoners.The thrust of the Deputy's question displays a complete lack of understanding of the change process which has been ongoing for some time now. I remind the House that, following protracted negotiations and an arbitration process, prison staff voted, by a substantial majority, to accept a revised Proposal for Organisational Change in the Irish Prison Service last August having rejected a similar proposal in April 2005. The agreement provides for implementation of the new working arrangements and the elimination of overtime working across the service within six months of the date of acceptance of the agreement, that is, by 18 February 2006. Savings in the order of €25 million per annum will be made as a result. Already my determination to tackle this unsustainable dependence on overtime to run our prisons has resulted in a reduction in the overtime bill of some €13.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003.Despite the enormity of the challenge that implementation of such radical change presents for both management and staff, the implementation of the new system is on target. It has been rolled out in ten institutions to date and will be rolled out in the remaining institutions on 12 February 2006. The new Prison Service escorts corps has been established on a country wide basis and is already making a major contribution in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of the service. The functional restructuring of the stores and maintenance functions provided for in the agreement is also progressing and the recruitment of the new recruit prison officer provided for in the agreement is imminent.As regards the rehabilitation of offenders, I can assure the Deputy that the new arrangements being put in place in the Prison Service are already producing resources for investment in prison programmes and services.For many years the Prison Service had been constrained to direct investment expenditure to the overtime-pay area in order to stay within budget. Now that the change programme has begun to roll out, resources for the first time in decades are coming available to restore prisoner programmes and services and indeed to substantially enhance them.A wide programme of education, training, health care and other prisoner focused measures are now being more fully resourced. The Prison Service has also begun to select staff for the enhanced training required to deliver such programmes and to expand the range of programmes available across prisons. In a number of prisons modern up to date workshops and other facilities are being commissioned. For example, in Limerick prison, new educational, medical and recreational facilities are under construction and will be completed later this year; in Wheatfield prison new workshops and a new laundry are completed and in operation; in Portlaoise, construction of new accommodation including educational and recreational facilities is under way; in St. Patrick's Institution, new workshops are nearing completion and will be in use in the coming weeks. In addition, plans are also well advanced for the introduction of a much needed professional clinical management structure which will greatly improve health care provision for prisoners across the prison system.The Deputy will appreciate that the effective delivery of these welcome prisoner programme enhancements must follow the adoption of the revised working arrangements and the necessary preparatory measures to skill up staff etc. Notwithstanding that the roll-out of the new arrangements will not be finalised until late next week, staff have already begun to be selected to support these programmes.I have made the point before that down the years all other expenditure priorities in the Prison Service budget were dwarfed by this overtime issue. Resources needed for training, capital programmes, rehabilitation programmes, education and modernisation were continuously being cannibalised to meet an insatiable demand for resources for overtime. Since we have started to achieve savings, we have been in a position to use the capital programme for the purpose for which it was intended. I have already outlined some of the initiatives in that regard. In addition to that, I am proceeding with the major programme to modernise prison facilities by replacing outdated prison estate at Mountjoy and Cork prisons. This programme will represent the single biggest investment commitment in improved prisoner facilities since the foundation of the State and will also greatly benefit from the savings being generated from the savings in spending on prison officers' overtime.I would suggest that the level of change being undertaken in the Prison Service is unprecedented in the public service. It is a credit to the staff and management involved that the process has been nurtured successfully to this point and I am optimistic that it will be brought to successful completion over the coming months.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	523	As the Deputy is aware, there is a statutory framework governing the asylum determination process in Ireland set out in the Refugee Act 1996 and it is not for me as Minister to determine who is or is not a refugee. The 1996 Act established two independent statutory offices to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These offices are the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The processing of applications within the framework of the 1996 Act in particular has due regard to the definition of a "refugee" in section 2 of that Act, which states that a "refugee" is " ... a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it".Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. Each application is assessed on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to both the subjective elements — the applicant's own account or personal history — and objective elements — up-to-date information on the applicant's country or place of origin. This country of origin information comes from a wide variety of sources, including organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the UK Home Office, the Canadian International Refugee Board, the US State Department and other EU member states as well as media and Internet sources.ORAC and RAT also consider the well-foundedness of each applicant's claim, that is, whether there are sufficient facts to permit the finding that, if returned to his or her country of origin, the applicant would face a serious risk of persecution. Credibility is also central to assessing an application, and it falls to the ORAC and RAT to decide whether the applicant's account is credible and whether they have a well-founded fear of persecution. Issues of relevance in assessing credibility include: (a) contradictions-inconsistencies; (b) plausibility of the applicant; and (c) level of detail in the claim. A negative finding as to overall credibility will generally lead to a conclusion that the applicant does not qualify for protection.There must also be a link between the persecution as alleged and one or more of the grounds set out in both the 1996 Act and the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, namely, being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The issue of the so-called "Internal Protection Alternative" is also relevant in many cases. If a person can find real and meaningful protection in any area in his or her own country, then clearly that person does not need international protection and the obligation to afford refugee status does not arise.Our system also guarantees every asylum applicant a right of appeal to a statutorily independent and separate body — the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Every asylum applicant is also guaranteed access to legal assistance provided by the Refugee Legal Service. The Deputy should also be aware that the UNHCR is given full access to our refugee determination process and can examine any case at any time to ensure fair procedures and compliance with our Geneva Convention obligations.I fully recognise that female genital mutilation is a practice which exists in a number of African countries. In the case of Nigeria, for example, country of origin information indicates that its prevalence varies widely from state to state within Nigeria. Indeed, a United Kingdom Home Office report on Nigeria, quoting another study, published in October 2005, indicates that the practice of FGM, which is described as a cultural tradition, has declined steadily over the past 15 years.Country of origin information also indicates that: the Nigerian Government publicly opposes the practice of FGM. While there are no federal laws banning FGM throughout the country, the practice has been specifically prohibited in parts of Nigeria at State and local government level; there is evidence that the Government and NGOs have taken initiatives aimed at informing and educating people about the dangers of the practice. For example, the Ministry of Health, women's groups, and many NGOs sponsored public awareness projects to educate communities about the health hazards of FGM; according to BAOBAB, a Nigerian Women's NGO, as referenced in the Joint British Home Office-Danish Immigration Service fact-finding mission to Nigeria published in January 2005, the Government and prominent NGOs in Nigeria provide protection to women escaping FGM. BAOBAB was of the opinion that FGM in itself is not a genuine reason for applying for asylum abroad; a United Kingdom and Danish authorities report, which was published in early 2005, points out that there are groups working to stop the practice of FGM and should a girl desire to avoid FGM in spite of pressure from her family to do otherwise, she would have the option of complaining to the national police force or the Nigerian Human Rights Commission and may also seek the protection of NGO's; and women have the option of relocating to another part of the country if they fear FGM.Numerous country of origin information reports from reliable sources which have looked at the applicability of the internal relocation concept in countries such as Nigeria, for example, have found that such relocation is not just possible, but happens in practice.

Measuring how equally people with disabilities are included in Irish Society, brings together statistics from various sources and uses this information to document the extent to which people with disabilities participate fully and equally in Irish society.The findings of the report derive from an analysis of available existing data, in particular from Census 2002. While the data have been in existence for some time, the report is nonetheless most welcome in that it provides a very useful compilation and statistical overview of the position of people with disabilities in all the important facets of their daily lives.It was the circumstances of people with disabilities which the report presents that fully informed the development by the Government, in consultation with representative bodies in the disability sector, of the national disability strategy which was launched by the Government in September 2004. That strategy underpins the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society by building on existing policy and legislation.The NDA report identifies a number of key areas to be addressed in the context of policy and service planning such as the accessibility of the environment, including the built environment, access to information and technology, the education needs of people with disabilities, their participation in employment and their income position. These, too, are key areas where improved provision and services have been identified as being central to the delivery of policy outcomes under the national disability strategy. A key provision of the Disability Act 2005, which is a cornerstone of the strategy, is the legal requirement of public bodies to make their services accessible to people with disabilities and sets out a timeframe whereby public bodies must make their buildings accessible.The Act also provides the legal basis for the preparation and publication by six Ministers of sectoral plans in respect of services provided to persons with specified disabilities by their Departments and-or public bodies under the aegis of those Departments. These are the Departments of Health and Children; Social and Family Affairs; Transport; Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.I fully anticipate that those Departments, in drawing up those sectoral plans, will have taken into account the circumstances of people with disabilities such as are highlighted in the NDA report in respect of transport services, health services, employment and training services, income maintenance and other services comprehended by the sectoral plans. I understand that those Departments are currently engaged in a comprehensive consultation process involving representative organisations and the NDA. These plans are to be laid before the Oireachtas as soon as possible but not later than one year after the commencement of the Act, that is by 28 July 2006. I can inform the Deputy that the NDA report, which was recently received in my Department, will be examined closely.

This initiative, for which the Garda authorities and the DPP are to be commended, is a response to a recommendation in the 1999 Nally Report on the Public Prosecution System that "as a measure to reduce the volume of cases prosecuted through the courts, a system should be introduced whereby offenders would, in certain circumstances specified from time to time by the Director of Public Prosecutions, be issued with warnings instead of being prosecuted".The scheme makes provision for the administering of a caution by a senior Garda officer for certain minor offences, as an alternative to prosecution in the District Court, where prosecution is not required by the public interest and it is determined that a caution would be an effective response.The schedule of offences to which the scheme applies covers certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1984, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and the Criminal Damage Act 1991. It was initially proposed to include in the scheme offences under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 1984 related to the possession of cannabis. However, the Garda Commissioner has indicated that he has decided to withdraw such offences from the scope of the scheme for the moment pending consultations within the Garda Síochána and with the DPP and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Any proposal to expand the scheme in the future is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda authorities and the Director of Public Prosecutions.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 31 December 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned by his legal representatives.His case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 on the prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations received on his behalf. On 9 November 2005, a deportation order was signed in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 24 November 2005, in order to make arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned presented as required and was given a further presentation date of 1 December 2005. He again presented as required and was given a final presentation date of 8 December 2005. The person concerned was deported from the State on a charter flight to Lagos on the night of 8-9 December 2005.The person concerned was deported following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. Consequently, I do not intend to revoke the deportation order in this case.

Following consideration of their claims by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal they were refused refugee status and deportation orders were signed in respect of them on 23 November 2005.The deportation orders were subsequently challenged by way of judicial review proceedings in the High Court. Arising from these proceedings the person concerned was released from prison on order from the High Court on conditional terms on 23 January 2006, pending the determination of the judicial review proceedings. These proceedings are ongoing. As the issues involved in the case are sub judice, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the matter at the present time.

The search was carried out on 30 December 2005. The reason for the search was explained to the occupants and they were shown a copy of the warrant at the time. A further meeting was held with the person referred to on 16 January.I am also informed that it is standard practice for protective gloves to be worn by members of the Garda Síochána when conducting searches.I understand an investigation file is currently being prepared by the Garda authorities and will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions in due course.

This assessment includes the nature of the impact on current information technology systems within the force. I understand that a number of police services in Europe have already introduced automatic number plate recognition systems as an enhancement to basic in-car camera systems.I can assure the Deputy that all relevant legislation, including data protection legislation, will be complied with in the event of a decision being made to acquire any such system.I am further informed that consideration is not being given to connecting any such system to closed circuit television in non-police vehicles, nor has there been any consideration of whether to have the time and location details of all number plates recognised by the system stored in a database. It is envisaged that any such system would include an electronic audit trail recording the specific number plates identified through the system.As part of their consideration of whether to procure such a system, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they will also consider the question of consultation with a range of interested parties and how such consultations would take place. Any proposal to procure such a system, when actually made by the Garda authorities, will be considered by my Department.

A strategic review of traffic policing was also published on that date. In line with the recommendations contained in that review, an assistant commissioner, traffic, was appointed on 22 February 2005.Between now and 2008, the traffic corps will increase its numbers to a complement of 1,200 on the following phased basis: 2006, 805; 2007, 1,030; and 2008, 1,200.The assistant commissioner, traffic, has been tasked with implementing the recommendation contained in the strategic review of traffic policing in line with the implementation plan contained in the report, which covers a three and a half to four year period.Garda traffic corps personnel are engaged in achieving the strategic objectives contained in the strategic review which are to contribute to reducing road fatalities and casualties; improve traffic flow; enforce road traffic legislation effectively and consistently; enforce road transport and haulage legislation effectively and consistently using available technologies; provide appropriate policing support and response to the national development plan provisions relating to traffic and transport; and provide a systematic and structured road traffic collision service, and provide accurate, timely and sufficiently detailed information to key stakeholders.While the members of the Garda Síochána assigned to the traffic corps are specifically dedicated to traffic duties, they remain full police officers and as such retain the general responsibility for preventing and detecting crime which all members of the Garda Síochána have. Similarly, members of the Garda Síochána not members of the traffic corps have the responsibility, inter alia, to deal with traffic duties when breaches of road traffic law occur. Gardaí spend two years training at the Garda College. The focus of such training is on all areas of policing. Garda management will not allow a situation to arise where the establishment of the traffic corps would lead to the gardaí who are members of it having no regard to other policing duties regardless of seriousness if and when they arise in the course of carrying out their duty, and similarly, gardaí who are not members not having regard to traffic policing duties. The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 46, 47, 52, 66, 69, 70 and 184 together.Section 15 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve and the Deputies will recall that the measure won widespread support in the House during the passage of the Act.The Act lays special emphasis on training for members of the Garda reserve. The Act provides that the power to appoint persons to the reserve may only be exercised if the Commissioner has submitted proposals to the Minister for Justice for the training of persons to be appointed and regulations have been made concerning their recruitment, training and terms and conditions. It also provides that a person may not be appointed to the reserve unless he or she has completed the prescribed training. It is also the case that the Garda Commissioner may determine the range of powers to be exercised and duties performed by reserve members. A reserve member will be bound by all the same legal, disciplinary and ethical obligations as a regular member.In July 2005, the month the Garda Síochána Act was enacted, the Garda Commissioner wrote to me proposing a Garda reserve with a strength of 4,000 members. By way of response, and in the context of advising the Garda Commissioner of the Government's policing priorities for 2006, I set the objective of recruiting 900 reserve members by September of this year.I understand the Commissioner is now finalising his proposals for the reserve, including specifically the training of members and their powers and duties, and I am sure that in doing this he will have looked to the successful experience of volunteer police in the UK and other jurisdictions. I will give careful consideration to the Commissioner's proposals when I receive them, which I expect will be very shortly, and I will then draw up the necessary regulations for the approval of Government under the Act. As part of that process I will fully consult with the Garda representative associations.The Garda reserve will be a supplementary support and, emphatically, not a replacement for gardaí. Proof of this is the current increase in the strength of the force from 12,000 to 14,000 members. This programme is well under way and will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The Garda budget is also at an all time high. This year's allocation of €1.29 billion represents an increase of 13% on the allocation for 2005. It includes provision of over €83.5 million for overtime, an increase of €23 million on last year's allocation, which will yield over 2.7 million hours of Garda overtime for frontline policing throughout the State.The Garda reserve will be a valuable additional support for the Garda Síochána. It will enhance its capacity to respond to emerging policing challenges and will reinforce its links with local communities. At a time when gardaí increasingly do not live in the areas they police, the Garda reserve will be a valuable source of local strength and knowledge. It has the support of the Oireachtas and, I believe, the support of the public. I look forward to the Garda Commissioner's proposals on the recruitment, training, powers and duties of the members of the reserve. I have undertaken to consult constructively with the Garda representative associations on the proposals and I will be asking them, for their part, to undertake to respect the clear will of the Oireachtas in this matter and engage positively in those consultations.

In line with the convention, my Department wrote to the US Department of Justice on 24 August 2004, requesting that it commence processing this individual's application.The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. In this regard, the US authorities informed my Department in May 2005 that they were not inclined to act favourably on the transfer request at that time. As such, it was not possible for my Department to process this individual's application any further.

These new measures include increases in fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts and the creation of mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.In this context I also propose to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Gárda Síochána before the proposed new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position and thus enable the Gárda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I have indicated previously that I regard the provision of adequate and proper accommodation for the Garda Síochána as a very important issue.There are in excess of 700 Garda stations in the country. This figure does not include major complexes like Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park in Dublin, the Garda College in Templemore and other units of accommodation. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not a simple task to maintain and refurbish so many Garda buildings, and certainly not one that is amenable to a quick fix solution. However, this task is being tackled in a systematic and purposeful manner through the Garda building programme. Those stations most in need of attention have been identified and are being addressed in a prioritised way, with the co-operation of the Garda authorities, the main representative associations, the OPW and my own Department.The Office of Public Works has indicated to me that it plans to spend of the order of €112 million in the period 2005 to the end of 2007 on a wide range of Garda projects including, for example, major projects in Ballymun, Finglas and Claremorris. In addition, the Office of Public Works is engaged in ongoing smaller projects involving refurbishment and maintenance related issues at Garda stations. That office has informed my Department that in 2005, €5.2 million was spent on 38 Garda stations on such works. This is additional to a budget in excess of €7 million for 2005 in the Garda Vote for maintenance of Garda premises.The Office of Public Works is reviewing, in consultation with my Department and the Garda authorities, the equity exchange programme, which aims to replace inadequate small Garda stations with modern, purpose built, stations on an exchange of equity basis.

The unit comprises a physical education section and six classrooms — one for art-craft, an open learning centre, a computer classroom and three general classrooms to cater for literacy, numeracy, English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, and general subjects. An allocation of approximately eight wholetime-equivalent teachers to staff the new unit has also been arranged with the Department of Education and Science.The physical education section of the new unit has been brought partially into operation and is used daily by prisoners up to the present. However, it was not possible to commission the general education section of the unit pending the outcome of negotiations with the Prison Officers' Association, POA, on revised working arrangements in the Prison Service. Agreement has since been reached with the POA on the change agenda and the new working arrangements are currently being rolled out across the prison system.A key feature of the new working arrangements is the introduction of a new prisoner transport escort corps. Essentially, this is a dedicated corps of staff whose task is to escort prisoners to-from court in new cellular vehicles, thus eliminating the need to resort to overtime working as had been the practice heretofore. As a temporary measure, the prisoner transport escort corps is operating from a section of the unit pending the completion of new accommodation for the corps. It is currently envisaged that this new accommodation will be completed by the second quarter of this year at which time the general education section of the unit will be opened.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 36 together.Funding of €110,000 in respect of a national missing persons helpline made available by my Department in 2002 and 2003 was channelled through the Victim Support organisation, and was in addition to the ongoing funding that organisation received for the provision of services to victims of crime. This funding of €110,000 was provided subject to the conditions that no funding beyond the year 2003 should be implied, and audited accounts should be provided to my Department on a calendar year basis. To date, no audited accounts have been received in my Department. At the end of 2003, my Department commissioned a review of the helpline from the Department of Social Sciences, Dublin Institute of Technology, which recorded the number of phone calls to the helpline up to that time at approximately 100. While the Department is of the view that this service is a valuable one for the relatives of missing persons, it may be the case that the service could be provided on a more cost effective basis as an add on to an existing service.The Victim Support organisation received financial support from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from 1985 to 31 March 2005. Almost €5.5 million had been made available over the five years up to 2005.In March 2005, I decided that continued funding of the Victim Support organisation could no longer be justified due to serious concerns in relation to governance, accountability for public funds and poor service levels, after a lengthy period of instability within the organisation.The missing persons helpline was operated from the headquarters of Victim Support alongside Victim Support's own helpline for victims of crime. I understand that Victim Support Ltd closed down its headquarters operation during 2005 and a number of staff were made redundant, including the person employed to operate the missing persons helpline. My Department had no role in the decision of Victim Support Ltd to make a number of its staff redundant, other than to insist that statutory requirements — notice, holiday pay, etc. — be met and the interests of the staff protected.Also, in March 2005, I established a new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures. The commission is entirely independent in its decision making and examines each application on its merits. In April 2005, the commission received an application from the Missing in Ireland Support Service for €71,000 to establish, staff and operate a helpline for missing persons. I am advised that in the course of follow-up discussions, the Missing in Ireland Support Service rejected an offer of funding of €25,000 from the commission and advised that it would accept the full amount sought or nothing. It should be borne in mind in this context that the commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not. I understand there was no further contact between the commission and Missing in Ireland Support Service until November 2005. At that time, the commission suggested to Missing in Ireland Support Service that it should contact my Department, which had provided funding for a helpline in 2002 and 2003, with a view to furthering its application for funding.Other than the request to the independent commission for funding, no request for funding has been made by the Missing in Ireland Support Service to my Department as such. It remains open to the Missing in Ireland Support Service to make a new application to my Department for assistance if they so wish. Any such application will be carefully considered on its merits.

To this end, the Minister established an internal project team charged with: conducting an overarching analytical review and scoping exercise, both nationally and internationally; consulting with stakeholders in the governmental and non-governmental sectors; and bringing forward recommendations for any necessary institutional reform.The Report on the Youth Justice Review, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library, was examined in the social inclusion institutional framework last June. The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, CCSI, approved the thrust of the recommendations at that time. The CCSI agreed also that proposals on the legal and structural amendments necessary to give effect to the recommendations should be brought to Government before the end of the year.On 13 December last, the Government noted the youth justice report and approved its publication. The Government agreed also to implement the report's key findings, including the establishment on a non-statutory basis of a youth justice service as an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the strategic direction of the new Office of the Minister for Children.In this report, the detention of 16 and 17 year olds was addressed within the wider context of detention for all children up to the age of 18, boys and girls, remanded or sentenced to custody by the courts. An expert group is to be set up shortly to examine the future requirements for secure accommodation for offending children under the age of 18, and to plan for the provision of the necessary facilities. The Government agreed to the appointment of a suitably experienced person to head up this group and to take responsibility for the area of children's detention.The new measures require the transfer of legal and administrative responsibilities for the detention of offenders under 18 years from the Department of Education and Science and from the Irish Prison Service. However, the educational ethos of the children detention schools will be retained within the new structures with a greater emphasis on vocational training to cater for the broader age group.Amendments to the Children Act 2001 are necessary to give effect to the proposals in respect of detention arising from the Report on the Youth Justice Review and other matters. The Government has approved the drafting of the official amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 to this effect. I have circulated the proposed amendments to the Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. These new developments will result in the removal of all children in detention under the age of 18 from the Irish Prison Service and adult prisons.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 178 and 179 together.The Garda Síochána employs a range of techniques in the fight against serious crime. The establishment of specialist Garda units, operating under an assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime effectively. The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the Garda specialist unit tasked with the role of tackling organised crime and it carries out this role by conducting intelligence-driven operations in close co-operation with other specialist units, including the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.In November 2005, the Garda Commissioner arranged for the allocation of an additional 50 officers to the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to augment the effort to target groups involved in organised crime in the Dublin metropolitan region. The unit is headed by a detective chief superintendent and works closely with gardaí deployed on Operation Anvil and with other specialist units.The Garda Síochána is now better resourced than at any time in its history. I am particularly pleased to have secured a €144 million increase, 13.2%, in the Garda Vote for this year. The Garda budget is now at an all-time historic high, having exceeded €1.2 billion for 2006. This enormous resource enables me to provide the Commissioner with funding for a visible policing package which, among other things, will facilitate additional funding for youth diversion schemes and hi-tech Garda vehicles and related equipment. I will also be providing further investment in technological equipment to assist the gardaí in their fight against crime. The most significant such investment will be that made in the national digital radio project to replace the existing analogue radio system.The provision for Garda overtime is increased by over €22 million, bringing the total overtime provision to €83.5 million for 2006 and will facilitate, among other things, the continuation of specialist Garda operations such as Operation Anvil, Operation Clean Street, Operation Encounter and Operation Nightcap. These operations are targeted at the prevention and detection of crimes such as gangland murders, organised crime, racketeering and other criminal activity which gives rise to serious community concern.The Deputy will be aware that in October 2004 the Government approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to a record 14,000 in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. The ongoing recruitment campaign will lead to a combined strength of both attested gardaí and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year.The Government's top policing priority for 2006 is to continue to target organised crime, including drug trafficking, and the gun culture associated with it through the use of specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.As a specific response to the problem of gun crime in Dublin, the Government decided to provide funding for Operation Anvil. This operation was undertaken not as the sole response to this problem but as a targeted response to augment the work which the gardaí were doing day in day out to address gun crime. It is an intelligence-led policing initiative which targets active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling, static checkpoints, uniformed mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain-clothes patrols and, covert operations.Operation Anvil has resulted in a number of very successful outcomes, including the seizure of 347 firearms. In addition, 23,654 checkpoints and 7,138 drugs searches have been carried out. The additional budgetary provision for 2006, which I referred to, will facilitate not just the continuation of this operation but also its geographical extension beyond the Dublin metropolitan region.In addition to Operation Anvil, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Delivery was set up to combat robberies of institutions and to target those involved in robberies of high value goods in transit. I am also informed that cases of witness intimidation are investigated on a case by case basis and, where the need arises, are dealt with by the Special Criminal Court on the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.All extortion related complaints are investigated by the Garda Síochána and its anti-racketeering unit investigates reports and targets criminals suspected of this type of criminality.Regarding the number of fatal "gangland" shootings in 2005, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of murders recorded in 2005 in which firearms were used is 21. While the term "gangland killings" tends to be widely used in the media in referring to the nature of certain unlawful killings and speculation in this respect is understandable, this does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda Síochána classifies crime or particular offences. Caution is necessary in ascribing particular motives to any particular incident as, potentially, this might jeopardise the procedures which need to be followed for the proper investigation and prosecution of offences. All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by the Garda Síochána.It is widely acknowledged that our legislative package for tackling serious and organised crime is already one of the toughest in Europe. The Criminal Justice Bill, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences. In November last year, I obtained Government approval to draft a range of amendments to the Bill, which I intend to bring forward during its passage through the Oireachtas. Proposed amendments include the creation of criminal offences in relation to participation in organised crime, the strengthening of existing provisions for the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking and a range of amendments to the Firearms Acts.I can assure the House that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	541	As of 30 January 2006, there were 253 prisoners serving sentences for sexual offences. These prisoners were accommodated in the following institutions: Arbour Hill, 84; Castlerea Prison, 20; Cork Prison, five; Limerick Prison, four; Midlands Prison, 77; Mountjoy (female) Prison, one; Mountjoy (male) Prison, two; St. Patrick's Institution, five; and Wheatfield Prison, 55.There are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders currently operating within the Irish prison system. These are as follows: individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service; the sex offender programme which has been in operation since 1994; and one-to-one interventions by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. While it is not possible to quantify with absolute accuracy participation in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody for sex offences have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above.The second intervention which I have specified in my reply is the intensive offence-focused group programme. The programme is managed and delivered by members of the Probation and Welfare Service and the Irish Prison Service's psychology service and caters for eight offenders at a time, taking 11 months to complete. In keeping with international best practice in this area, the programme is a structured, offence focused programme, employing a cognitive behavioural approach with a relapse prevention component. The aim of the programme is to reduce sexual victimisation in society. This is achieved through enabling offenders gain increased control over their offending behaviour and thereby reducing the probability of re-offending. A total of 114 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date. A further eight men are currently undertaking the programme in Arbour Hill Prison. There is no waiting list in operation in respect of participation on the programme. The programme is voluntary and the practice is to invite all eligible sex offenders to apply for a place on the programme when a new group programme is being set up. The reasons applicants for the programme might be considered unsuitable include: the applicant's sentence is under appeal, current serious mental health problems would militate against effective participation in the programme, the applicant is not sufficiently prepared for the intensity of the programme, denial of offence etc.The number of offenders undergoing one-to-one counselling in relation to their sexual offending is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided to sex offenders in prison. Some individuals engage with the therapeutic services initially to seek assistance in adjusting to imprisonment or to address their mental health needs. Following such interventions, offenders are often more open to looking at their sexual offending and a concentrated period of motivational work is conducted to help them address their offending behaviour. In response to such counselling many offenders, who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment, are motivated towards some process of change. For some offenders this results in them undertaking the sex offender programme, for others it results in sustained individual therapy around their offending or engagement in some other programme available in the prison system.The number of suitably motivated offenders applying for participation on the sex offenders programme has declined in recent years and this is a matter of concern. The Irish Prison Service is currently examining this situation to determine what measures may be taken to increase the number of offenders participating on the programme. A number of additional psychologists have recently been appointed to the Irish Prison Service. These new psychologists will play an important role in working with offenders to address their offending behaviour, including work with sex offenders aimed at enhancing their preparedness for possible participation on the sex offender programme.

I also understand that he is scheduled to be further reviewed by the visiting psychiatric service in the future. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that he is currently receiving appropriate care within the prison system.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The person in question made an application for asylum on 18 October 1999. This application was refused on 17 August 2001 and appealed on 10 September 2001 to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The appeal was refused on the 18 February 2002 and a notification of proposal to deport from the State under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 together with the refusal to grant a declaration of refugee status issued on 15 March 2002.Representations were received in relation to the proposal and were under consideration. However, before final considerations were made on the proposal the person in question made an application for permission to remain in the State based on his marriage to an Irish national. The marriage took place on 4 February 2003 and the application was received in March 2003. Before a final decision was made on the case he withdrew his application for residency based solely on his marriage to an Irish national on 7 September 2004 indicating that he was voluntarily repatriating to his country of origin. He did not pursue this option and on 15 December 2004 he reapplied for residency in the State based solely on his marriage to an Irish national.Marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to enter or reside in the State solely on that basis. Applications of this type are dealt with on a strict chronological basis and, in fairness to all other applicants, are currently taking approximately 16 months to process. The resources allocated to process such applications are dependent on the prioritised work requirements of the immigration division of my Department at any one time, which is operating against a background of significant increases on demands for its services over a wide range of areas, including the type of application referred to by the Deputy. For example, there were 156 such cases in 2001 and at the end of December 2005 the number of application on hands had risen to 407.In order to prevent abuses of the system, insofar as is possible and without unduly interfering with the Irish citizen's private circumstances, the immigration division will seek to establish various matters. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple are residing in a family unit. This may involve requesting supporting documentation as evidence of the relationship and-or an interview by the immigration authorities of either or both parties. A decision on the residency application in question will be made after full consideration of all the circumstances particular to this case.

The report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee as well as the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission will inform the work of the group. I am confident that the group will assist in the early formulation of legislative policy in this area. Its terms of reference and a timetable are being finalised.

The information requested has now been compiled by the Garda authorities and I have issued it to Deputy Costello.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 102 of 23 November 2005.I would remind the Deputy that the civilianisation programme approved by Government in 2001 is to be implemented on a phased basis over a number of years. I am pleased to point out that significant progress has been made with the appointment of 113 civilian finance officers who are doing the district finance officer duties which were hitherto performed by gardaí. Moreover, the recent establishment of the Garda Information Service Centre, GISC, in Castlebar, and the pending transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda Síochána as civil servants of the State are significant developments in the context of greater Garda civilianisation.The establishment of the GISC alone will, when fully operational, allow for the equivalent of up to 300 gardaí to be freed up for frontline outdoor policing duties. While the immediate focus is on providing the necessary staffing, training and resources so that the GISC will be fully operational during 2006, it is also the case that my Department, on an ongoing basis, reviews the possibility of civilianising other posts where possible, and progress is being made in this regard. However, the civilianisation programme has to be implemented within the confines of the Government decision of 4 December 2002 which placed a cap on numbers across the civil and public service.Having said that, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the ongoing implementation of the civilianisation programme. I am also determined that the additional gardaí being recruited under the current historic expansion of the force will be deployed to frontline, visible and effective policing duties.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	547	Funding is made available through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to several community policing fora which have arisen in the context of the Government's national drugs strategy.Two such fora operate on a pilot basis under the aegis of the north inner city and Finglas-Cabra local drugs task forces respectively. The north inner city community policing forum was established in 1999 and operates in Dublin's north east inner city area. This project receives annual funding of €78,778 through the local drugs task force initiative. In addition, the north inner city task force initiated an additional pilot project in 2004 which involves extending the work of the original policing forum within the wider task force area. This project extension receives annual funding of €67,896. Dublin City Council acts as a channel of funding to the north inner city projects.Similarly, a community policing forum under the aegis of the Finglas-Cabra local drugs task force was established as a pilot initiative in 2003. This project also receives annual funding of €51,584 through the local drugs task force initiative. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the channel of funding for this initiative.The community policing forum in Dublin's "A" Garda district, Kevin Street-Kilmainham, was established by the Commissioner in 2000 on a pilot basis following extensive consultations between the gardaí and community interests. No specific allocation of funding was made for this forum and the forum did not provide a funded co-ordinator on a similar basis to fora operating under the local drugs task force initiative. I outlined the position with regard to the non-funding of co-ordinators for these fora from Garda funds in reply to previous questions from Deputy Costello on 9 December 2003 and from Deputy Kenny on 23 November 2004. I should point out that, as an exceptional measure, the Garda Commissioner made a small contribution to the Rialto Forum towards an outstanding invoice early in 2005.The establishment of community policing fora, in general, needs to be delivered in the context of an appropriate policy framework for what will be relatively new partnership structures involving the gardaí, local authorities and local communities to deal with a range of issues of mutual concern. Such a framework will ensure that community policing fora are developed in an appropriate, consistent and properly planned manner.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides a statutory basis for enhanced co-operation between the gardaí and local authorities through the establishment of joint policing committees, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to local authorities and the Commissioner after consulting the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A joint policing committee will be a forum for local authorities and the Garda Síochána to discuss matters affecting policing of the local authorities administrative areas. Work is under way, involving my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, on finalising draft guidelines for the joint policing committees. The guidelines will include provisions on resourcing the committees. It is anticipated that several joint policing committees will be established on a pilot basis and will begin to function this year. A sum of €100,000 has been made available in the Garda Vote to support the work of these committees in 2006.The Act also provides that a joint policing committee may establish, in consultation with the local Garda superintendent, as the committee considers necessary within specific neighbourhoods, local policing fora. It is intended that supplemental guidelines for such policing fora will be made at a later date.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Laytown Garda station as at 31 January 2006 was eight — all ranks.I am further advised that there are no plans to extend the opening hours of Laytown Garda station. The extension of the opening hours at the station would only serve to confine more personnel to indoor administrative duties. It is the view of the Garda authorities that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor police duties.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.The Garda Commissioner will draw up plans for the distribution of these additional resources and in this context the needs of the Laytown, Bettystown and Mornington areas will be fully considered.

When finalised, this plan will include detailed proposals for the utilisation and development of the site and will also take account of issues to include heritage and historical context as well as the proper and sustainable development of the area itself. It is too early at this stage to indicate when the site will be disposed of or the precise means of disposal. The process will provide for, and in due course include, consultations with the local authorities including Dublin City Council in line with the relevant statutory provisions.

Marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to enter or reside in the State solely on that basis. Applications of this type are dealt with on a strict chronological basis and, in fairness to all other applicants, take approximately 16 months to process. In the case to which the Deputy refers two requests for further documentation have recently issued to the legal representatives of the person concerned in an effort to process the application further. To date no response has been received.The resources allocated to process such applications depend on the prioritised work requirements of the immigration division of my Department at any one time, which operates against a background of significant increases on demands for its services over a wide range of areas, including the type of application to which the Deputy refers. For example, there were 156 such cases in 2001 and at the end of December 2005 the number of applications on hands had risen to 407.The immigration division of my Department has growing experience of marriages being entered into for the sole purpose of enabling the non-national in question to gain entry to the State. In order to prevent abuses of the system, in so far as is possible, and without unduly interfering with the Irish citizen's private circumstances, the immigration division will seek to establish various matters. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple resides in a family unit. This may involve requesting supporting documentation as evidence of the relationship and-or an interview of either or both parties by the immigration authorities. A decision on the residency application in question will be made on receipt of the information requested and after full consideration of all the circumstances particular to this case.

The details of the proposals are available on my Department's website.This legislation will radically overhaul and reform the coroner service. It will provide for a modernisation of the death investigation, post-mortem and inquest procedures to ensure a better service to society in general, and to the relatives of the deceased in particular, than is possible under the 1962 Coroners Act.There are two critical elements involved in the reform of the service: development of optimum structures and administration for a modern coroner service and widening the scope of the inquest. The Bill provides for the establishment of a coroner service to be located in Navan, County Meath. On the establishment of the service, full responsibility for coroners, including financial responsibility, will rest with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the involvement of local authorities will cease.The Bill proposes to widen the scope of the inquest from investigating the proximate medical cause of death to establishing in what circumstances the deceased met his or her death. The Act of 1962 and as interpreted by the courts, restricts the examination to "how" the person died.The Government legislation programme announced by the Chief Whip on 25 January 2006 indicates that the Bill is expected to be published in mid-2006.

I have made significant progress in implementing the provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. One of the key measures in the Act provides for the establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Last week the Dáil passed a resolution recommending three persons for appointment by the President to be the members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. A similar resolution was also passed by Seanad Éireann last week. This followed the nomination of these three persons by the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Act. I understand that they will be appointed by the President on 10 February.I can also tell the Deputy that progress has been made in establishing the Garda inspectorate, another important provision of the Act. The post of chief inspector has been advertised and it is hoped to make an appointment in the near future. The posts for the other two members of the inspectorate will be advertised shortly.The preparation of guidelines providing for the establishment of joint policing committees is well advanced and I intend to issue these as soon as possible following consultation with my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs as required by the Act.Preparations are also in hand to make the Garda Commissioner the accounting officer for the force. The target date is 1 July 2006. Revised Garda discipline regulations are being prepared and these will be the subject of consultation with the Garda associations as required by the Garda industrial relations processes.I am also keen to advance the establishment of a Garda reserve. The Garda Commissioner is drawing up proposals on the duties of reserve members, the powers they will exercise and the training they will receive. The Act provides for phased implementation. I have made two commencement orders, bringing several provisions of the Act into effect.The first commencement order was made on 15 July 2005 and brought into effect from 1 August 2005, Part 1, other than section 4; and sections 7, 39, 40,41, 47, 48, 49, 60, 62, other than subsection (2)(b) and (c), 124, 130 and 131.The second commencement order was made on 9 December, 2005. The provisions brought into effect from that date are sections 24, 63 to 66, 67(3), 67(4), 67(5), 68 to 72, 76 to 80, 121(b), Schedule 2, in so far as it relates to a person transferred under section 72 of the Act to the Ombudsman Commission and Schedule 4.I made an establishment day order in respect of the Ombudsman Commission, on 12 December 2005 under section 63 of the Act. A third commencement order, which will provide for most of the remaining provisions of the Act to be brought into effect is being prepared. The necessity for different commencement dates arises because certain measures must be completed before particular provisions can become operative. Examples would be the finalisation of the new code of ethics for the force, the actual complaints, investigation and related provisions regarding the Ombudsman Commission, the establishment of the inspectorate, and the completion of the new disciplinary arrangements.I have outlined briefly above the progress I have made in the implementation of a several key areas of the Act. Last year I established the Garda Síochána Act 2005 implementation review group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, to oversee the process of implementing the Act. This group has recently concluded its work and reported to me. I am arranging for the publication of their report shortly. It sets out in greater detail the progress achieved in implementing the provisions of the Act.

In addition, one sergeant and four Garda juvenile liaison officers from Tallaght Garda station are directly associated with these projects.I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects. A budget of €6.6 million has been provided for the Garda youth diversion projects and local drugs task force projects in 2006. This represents an increase of €1.2 million in the budget for youth diversion compared with 2005. It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007. I have therefore asked the Garda Commissioner to bring forward proposals for further community-based initiatives in this area in light of the additional funding.I am informed by the Garda authorities that an updated application for an additional project in the Tallaght area, the STAY project, was received by the Garda community relations section on 5 January 2006. The catchment area proposed by this project covers Tymon north. The application is currently being assessed by Garda community relations in accordance with the Garda youth diversion project guidelines. When the assessment has been completed, a recommendation will be forwarded to my Department for consideration.

She had a child, born in the State, on 6 May 1996. She was granted residency in the State on the basis of her parentage of an Irish-born citizen child on 29 September 1997. She left Ireland in January 1998 and returned to Nigeria to be with her father-in-law who was ill at the time. He died in April 2002 after a long illness. Following his death the person concerned and her Irish citizen child returned to the State on 13 December 2002. On 4 February 2003, she applied to renew her residency on the basis of her parentage of an Irish-born citizen child.On 19 August 2003, a notice of intention to deport letter issued from my Department. This letter informed her,  inter alia, that the non-national parent of an Irish-born child no longer derived an automatic right to remain in the State by virtue of that fact alone. The letter also afforded her three options in accordance with section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended — namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to make written representations within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why she should not be deported.Her case was examined further under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee (Prohibition of Refoulement) Act 1996. Consideration was given to her representations for temporary leave to remain in the State, which were lodged on her behalf by her legal representative by letter dated 29 August 2003.A deportation order was made in respect of her on 28 June 2004. Notice of this order was served on her by registered post requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, on 28 July 2004. She failed to present on that date and was recorded as evading her deportation on 9 August 2004.On 22 February 2005, she was detained by the UK authorities at Heathrow Airport having arrived there on a flight from Nigeria. Contact was made with the GNIB and it was agreed that she should be returned to Nigeria on foot of her deportation order. She was recorded by GNIB as an enforced deportation order following her return from the UK.She applied for permission to remain in the State on 23 March 2005, under the revised arrangements of the Irish-born child 2005 scheme, having again illegally re-entered the State. She was refused and notified by letter dated 16 August 2005.On 11 August 2005, the person referred to by the Deputy applied for asylum in the State. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 12 October 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a new deportation order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended — namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.Her case was re-examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee (Prohibition of Refoulement) Act 1996. Consideration was given to representations received on her behalf from the Refugee Legal Service for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 18 November 2005, I reaffirmed the original deportation order in respect of her. The person concerned and her legal representative have been informed of my decision and she has been requested to report to the GNIB on Thursday, 9 February 2006 to make arrangements for her removal from the State. Her removal from the State is now an operational matter for the GNIB.

He withdrew his application for declaration of refugee status on 24 April 1998 and made an application for residency based on his parentage of an Irish-born child.On 21 March 2002, a registered letter issued to the person concerned requesting documentation to support his application. This letter was returned marked "not called for". On 6 November 2002, my Department again wrote to the person concerned requesting the information and a response was received on 19 November 2002.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L&O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. The application from the person concerned fell into this category.On 10 November 2003, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him, as he did not have permission to remain in the State. He was given the following options: to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons as to why he should be granted temporary leave to remain in the State, that is, why he should not be deported; to leave the State voluntarily; or to consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him.An application for leave to remain in the State was received from his legal representatives on 15 December 2003. It must also be noted that our records indicate that the person concerned, notwithstanding his earlier claim for residency based on his parentage of an Irish-born child, did not apply for leave to remain under the IBC 2005 scheme which recently ended.In the circumstances and in order to clarify the exact circumstances of this individual, a letter recently issued to his legal representatives giving them the opportunity to make further representations on behalf of their client. Once these representations have been received, an assessment of his case as it currently stands can be made and it is expected that a decision will be reached shortly thereafter.

At my request, Operation Anvil is being extended outside the Dublin metropolitan region during 2006, with a view to addressing the problem of serious crime.Operation Anvil will continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational and policing terms. It has contributed to encouraging outcomes. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, to date, there have been 1,522 arrests, which include 17 arrests for murder, 310 arrests for serious assault, 629 arrests for burglary and 280 arrests for robbery offences. Furthermore, the total number of firearms seized to date under Operation Anvil is 347 and property to the value of more than €5.5 million has been recovered.The total number of overtime hours paid for the operation from its commencement up to 31 January 2006 is 260,996. The net incremental cost of the operation, from its commencement to 31 January 2006, is €9,683,206. This figure includes the cost of overtime, travel and subsistence, and other ancillary costs.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	564	It is absurd to state that there has been a dramatic increase in headline crime for 2005 when the level of headline crime for 2005 is 4.4% lower than the level for 2002. I did not hear the Deputy state that there was a dramatic fall in headline crime when there was a decrease of 3% recorded for 2003 compared to 2002 and a further decrease in headline crime of 4% recorded for 2004 compared to 2003.Since I took the decision to publish crime statistics on a quarterly basis at the beginning of 2003, I have consistently emphasised that care must be taken in interpreting the statistics, especially when considering short-term fluctuations and extrapolating trends over short periods.I would like to refer to long-term crime patterns. The level of headline crime in 2005 is actually lower than that for 2003 by 1.6% and for 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore, in 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population.Our headline crime rate continues to compare favourably with those of our nearest neighbours. In England and Wales, in the year April 2003 to March 2004, the most recent for which figures are available, 113 crimes were committed per 1,000 population. In 2004-05 in Scotland, there were 86.3 crimes per 1,000 population and in Northern Ireland 69 per 1,000 population compared with our rate of 24.6 per 1,000.There have, moreover, been significant reductions in 2005 in the incidence of manslaughter, down 50%, aggravated sexual assault, down 43%, robbery of cash-goods in transit, down 27%, robbery from the person, down 23%, and theft from the person, down 18%. However, the overall increase in recorded crime and the increases in particular categories in the most recent figures I published are disappointing and I will not downplay my concerns in that respect.However, I do welcome in particular the significant decrease of 27% in the number of incidents of robbery of cash-goods in transit — down from 62 in 2004 to 45 in 2005. This trend improved in the fourth quarter with a decrease of 47%.Operation Delivery, an initiative undertaken by the Garda Síochána to counteract the increase in cash-in-transit robberies, which emerged in 2004, has contributed significantly to this welcome decrease. Furthermore, the new code of practice now being operated by the major financial institutions and security companies involved in the cash-in-transit industry, has dramatically raised the standards in operation. I took a direct personal hand in dialogue with the leadership in the banking and security sectors in securing the adoption of this new code, which has made a significant contribution to the decrease. These developments have been underpinned by the establishment of the Private Security Authority, which has also taken place on my watch.I also welcome the increase in the number of detections for possession of drugs for sale or supply, up 20%, and possession of firearms, up16%. In both cases these are offences which, in the main, become known as a result of active police detection work. This trend continued in the fourth quarter and, in the case of possession of firearms, improved, with an increase of 24%. These are statistical crime figure increases which we should welcome because they are detections flowing from increased Garda vigilance and a proactive approach.Operation Anvil, which the Garda Commissioner introduced last May and for which I obtained substantial additional resources, made a significant contribution to this level of detection. Operation Anvil will continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational and policing terms. At my request, the Commissioner has extended the operation to Garda divisions outside Dublin. The most recent figures available to me show that Operation Anvil has contributed to encouraging outcomes, with a total number of arrests of 1,522, which include 17 arrests for murder, 310 arrests for serious assaults, 629 arrests for burglary and 280 arrests for robbery offences. Furthermore, the total number of firearms seized to date under Operation Anvil is 347, and property to the value of more than €5.5 million has been recovered.While it is the case that a number of the increases in headline crime statistics reflect increased enforcement activity on the part of the Garda Síochána, the overall picture indicates that there is no room for complacency. The Government's decision to continue to devote unprecedented resources to the fight against crime is clearly justified, as is my insistence that those resources be deployed at the front line of policing in this State.This year, the Garda Síochána has the highest level of resources in its history at €1,290 million, which represents an increase of €146 million or 13% on 2005. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is €83.5 million — an increase of €23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly assist the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The €83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.I take great satisfaction in the Government's decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, both of attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006 and 14,000 attested gardaí in two years' time. I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.In addition to this increase in resources, I am also bringing forward proposals to strengthen significantly the legislative provisions available. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures, which will enhance the powers of the Garda Síochána in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. It addresses such matters as the preservation of crime scenes, increased periods of detention in the case of arrestable offences, search warrant powers for the Garda Síochána, amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990, provision for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain lesser public order offences, and the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements.The Garda Síochána policing plan for 2006, recently published by the Commissioner, includes a targeted reduction in the incidence of crime by 2% and an increase in detection rates by 2%. It also reflects the Government's priorities in the fight against crime and the actions which it wishes to be taken.I can assure Deputies that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling crime under continuing review.

From inquiries made at the scene it was established that a person had been removed to hospital. Some preliminary measurements were taken at the scene by the Garda Síochána. There was no indication as to the seriousness of the accident and, as a consequence, the scene was not preserved. By the time it became apparent that the accident had resulted in a fatality, the scene had been contaminated by other vehicular traffic and onlookers.An investigation file was completed and submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. On 4 October 2001, the DPP directed that no prosecution take place in this case. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a review of the investigation is being conducted and the issues raised by the Deputy will form part of the review.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 167 together.I have noted the comments made in early January by Archbishop John Neill and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin on issues concerning immigrants and I appreciate the sincerity with which their comments were made. I do not, however, agree with the suggestion that, as the Deputy puts it, we should "regularise the status of asylum seekers who have been five years or more in the asylum process".The proposal from the two archbishops would appear to be even wider in scope in that it refers to immigrants generally who are here longer than five years being permitted to remain in the State.In the case of asylum applicants, I would point out to the Deputies that due to the comprehensive Government investment in staff and resources in the asylum determination agencies over recent years, there are now only 433 applicants in the asylum system for more than six months, with many of these being at an advanced stage of processing. This compares to some 6,500 cases over six months old, which were outstanding in September 2001."Regularising" the status of asylum seekers on the basis suggested would have a negative impact on asylum applications, which fell by some 40% in 2004 and a further 9% in 2005. Indeed, it would act as a pull factor in terms of the number of unfounded applications being received. Such a move would also impact negatively on the considerable progress which has been made in reducing timescales for processing applications and on our ability to accommodate the individuals concerned.By way of illustration concerning pull factors, I would refer the Deputies to the fact that a considerable increase in asylum numbers was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to allow asylum seekers access to the labour market. This led to a three-fold increase in the average number of applications per month, rising to 1,217 applications in December 1999 compared to an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999.Our asylum processing agencies now operate accelerated processing arrangements for nationals of those states which are subject to ministerial prioritisation directions, namely, Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa. Under these arrangements, applications are processed at the initial stage in ORAC in an average of 16 working days, and for appeal determinations in RAT in an average of 14 working days. These five nationalities currently account for almost 40% of all asylum applications.All asylum applications are now allocated an interview date on the day on which they apply for refugee status to ORAC. This means that an interview is normally scheduled within 20 working days from the date of the initial application with cases in the prioritised caseload being interviewed within nine to 12 days.The greatest service we can provide to those who should be recognised as refugees is to ensure that their claims are decided speedily, and that nothing is done which undermines this policy priority by attracting large numbers of non-genuine applicants to the detriment of genuine applicants. The structures currently in place provide the State with an asylum system that meets the highest international standards and fulfils our international obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees to those seeking asylum. Overloading the process with large numbers of new applicants would be totally contrary to these obligations and could completely negate the major investment in effort, time and resources which has gone into bringing our overall strategy to its current status.As regards immigration generally, the Government has already responded generously through the Irish-born child scheme 2005, which has resulted so far in 16,696 applicants being granted leave to remain out of a total of 17,907 applications received. The IBC-05 scheme has also had an impact on other areas of the asylum and immigration processes as, for example, many of those successful applicants might otherwise have been considered for leave to remain in the context of the deportation system.Following the ending of that scheme, an analysis is being carried out to determine the number and nature of the remaining cases and to establish a reasonable view of the number that are still in the State. This will facilitate the normal ongoing review of approaches taken to particular caseloads within the immigration system having regard to the reality of the circumstances which exist at the time.This year, I will also be bringing forward legislation in the form of an immigration and residence Bill with a view to providing a comprehensive legislative base for such areas as visas, border controls, admissions of non-nationals and residence status, as well as action to address illegal immigration. A key part of the Bill will include proposals for a new streamlined removals system for persons not entitled or no longer entitled to be in the State. Legislation will also be brought forward to assist in tackling people trafficking and smuggling.

The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority. The report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002.Paternity leave was considered by the working group, taking into account the following issues: the reconciliation of work and family life and balanced participation of men and women in work and family life; the cost to employers; and the comparative situation in other EU member states.While acknowledging that a statutory arrangement to provide an entitlement to time off for fathers at the time of childbirth would enhance arrangements for the reconciliation of work and family life, the working group could not reach consensus on the issue.Subsequently, no agreement was reached on paternity leave by the social partners in the context of the negotiations on the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. In the absence of a consensus among the social partners, the Government does not propose to provide for a statutory entitlement to paternity leave.

Information is not compiled on the nationality of persons who apply to join the Garda Síochána.The PAS conducts two voluntary equality monitoring surveys, one at the application stage and a second at stage 1, aptitude test. Completion of those surveys is voluntary and is not linked in any way with the actual application form.Of a total of 8,462 applicants, 6,890 of those, i.e. 81%, completed the survey at the application stage. The PAS has compiled statistical reports of the profile of applicants based on the information provided by those who completed the voluntary surveys. This is based on the described "ethnic category" of applicants. Data are not recorded based on country of origin.The PAS has advised that, of the 6,890 applicants who completed the survey at application stage, 1,310 applicants indicated that they were in an ethnic category other than "white Irish" as set out in the following table:Ethnic CategoryNo. who applied and completed equality monitoring surveyWhite — other348Black — African124Black — other5Asian — Chinese602Asian — other153Other78Total1,310The equivalent breakdown of applicants based on the results of the second PAS survey of applicants who went on to attend the Stage 1 aptitude tests is as set out in the table below:Ethnic categoryNo. who sat testWhite — other146Black — African45Black — other4Asian — Chinese463Asian — other76Other123Total857This survey at stage 1 is also voluntary but not anonymous.

I look forward to the day when trainees originating from all continents will graduate at the college and go on to achieve career distinction in the Garda Síochána. Planning for the policing service we want to have for this country in 20 years' time should begin now. We must be proactive, progressive and have a vision as to how the Garda Síochána can provide an effective policing service in a more diverse Ireland.

I have received a copy of that report, which is under examination in my office, and in that regard I have asked that an interdepartmental working group be established to consider the issues involved.Furthermore, on 7 December 2005 my office met the Social Services Inspectorate and the HSE to discuss the issue of accommodation standards for unaccompanied minors. It was agreed at that meeting that the standards for children in residential care will apply to accommodation for unaccompanied minors of 16 years and under. Regarding accommodation for those in the 17 to 18 age group, the same standards will apply, subject to guidance notes being drafted by the SSI in consultation with the HSE.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 to 80, inclusive, together.The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Services Executive, HSE, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. That includes responsibility for fluoridation.Fluoridation of public water supplies as a public health measure is accepted as being one of the most effective methods of ensuring against tooth decay. The World Health Organisation, WHO, recommends fluoridation of public water supplies and has stated that "fluoridation of water supplies, where possible, is the most effective public health measure for the prevention of dental decay." The WHO has also stated that "people of all ages, including the elderly, benefit from community water fluoridation".The recently completed survey of oral health, covering the whole island, shows that fluoridation of public water supplies continues to be a highly effective public health measure. It has contributed significantly to a major reduction in the incidence of dental decay in the Republic of Ireland. That compares favourably with the incidence of dental decay in Northern Ireland, which has significantly higher rates of dental decay and which does not have fluoridated water supplies.The oral health survey also shows that fluoridation of public water supplies has a significant impact on dental decay in disadvantaged areas. The gap in decay between non-disadvantaged and disadvantaged areas in the Republic of Ireland is significantly less than the gap between such areas in Northern Ireland.The research carried out shows that, at the levels of usage of fluoride in the Republic of Ireland's public water supply, there is no risk to health. Fluoridation of the water supply in Ireland is limited to a maximum of one part per million. In that regard, the WHO and the European Union have identified that fluoridation levels below 1.5 parts per million are acceptable.The Forum on Fluoridation recognised that there had been some increase in the incidence of mild dental fluorosis in Ireland. Most dental fluorosis is detectable only by dentists. The forum, while recommending that fluoridation of water supplies continue, recommended a reduction in the levels of fluoride used from between 0.8 parts per million and 1 part per million to between 0.6 parts per million and 0.8 parts per million.The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health was set up in 2004. The terms of reference for the expert body are: to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Forum on Fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research — including emerging issues — on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; and to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his or her request or on its own initiative.As part of its work in implementing the recommendations of the forum, the expert body examined the question of what amendments may be required to the regulations, under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, to give effect to the forum's recommendation to reduce the level of fluorides in the public water supplies. The expert body has reported its findings to my Department. My Department is currently taking the necessary steps to introduce a new regulation.A research project on fluoride delivery systems, which includes an investigation into fluoride intake in the Irish population, was undertaken at the Oral Health Services Research Centre, OHSRC, in University College Cork on behalf of the Department.As part of that project, the OHSRC developed methods to be used when measuring fluoride ingestion in the population. One of the areas of research pursued was the development of standardised methods for measuring fluoride content of samples of saliva, urine, serum, fingernail clippings and mineralised tissues. Those studies were undertaken in close collaboration with researchers in Europe and the US to make sure that the methods being used conform to international standards. The results of that research and proposals for any future research are a matter for consideration by the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency, which are medium, high and maximum. Included in those payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001.The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of those provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. An additional €20 million has been provided for subvention payments this year, including addressing the variations in payments in different areas.The broad policy questions relating to long-term care have been examined by an interdepartmental group on long-term care, which has now reported to Government. Among the issues that it has examined is the question of the appropriate level of State support for long-term residential care. The report has been submitted to the Government.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	580	Current information on the number of speech and language therapists in the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain and consequently the ratios per 1,000 of the population as compared with this country, is not held by the Department of Health and Children. The report, Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, prepared by Peter Bacon and Associates and published in July 2001, stated that international data on the ratios of therapists, including speech and language therapists, to the population are rare. The report also highlighted that definitions and means of measurement differ and consequently reliable measurements are difficult to obtain. However, the report provided information on the ratio of therapists to population in England and Ireland at that time. This information determined that there were 9.6 speech and language therapists per 100,000 of population in England compared with 8.1 in Ireland.There were 548 whole time equivalent speech and language therapists employed in the public health service at end September 2005. This represents an increase of 162 or 42% over the number employed at end December 2000 and reflects significant increases in numbers employed in promotional grades. This substantial improvement in employment levels, together with the quadrupling of the number of training places in speech and language therapy, from 25 to 100 places, arising from the implementation of the recommendations of the Bacon report, will continue to contribute to significant gains in population ratios for the speech and language therapy profession on an ongoing basis.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	584	According to the most recent Health Service Executive — employers agency survey of nursing resources in the public health service, recruitment remains ahead of resignations and retirements. Employers reported that 1,131 vacancies existed at 30 September 2005, a vacancy rate of 3.24%. This figure includes vacancies in hospitals, intellectual disability services and community health. It does not include vacancies in the private health sector. The vacancy figure should be seen in the context of overall employment in the public health service which now stands at 34,878 whole time equivalent nurses and midwives, 41,655 individuals, which represents a 36% increase since 1997.There will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and locations. There is an additional pressure this year due to the lack of domestic nursing graduates in autumn 2005 because of the move from a three-year diploma to a four-year degree programme to train nurses. The first graduates from the degree programme will be available for recruitment this coming autumn.The HSE's nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention national project is monitoring the manpower situation on an ongoing basis. During 2005 the HSE conducted a successful recruitment drive in India and the Philippines and there will be a further international recruitment campaign this year. The HSE is also targeting inactive nurses for recruitment through an extensive advertising campaign. The financial arrangements for those undertaking back to nursing courses were improved last year. There was a 62% increase in attendance at back to nursing courses in 2005.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	587	While the Health Service Executive, HSE, has no statutory obligation to provide chiropody services to GMS patients, in practice arrangements are made to provide these services. Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time. Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over. In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.I consider it inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE. The Department of Health and Children requested the HSE to initiate a review of the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. The HSE has recently advised me that it has initiated a review of chiropody services.

The HSE has been asked to pursue the issues raised and replies will issue directly to the relevant correspondents.An interdivisional group has been established in the Department, comprising the office of the chief medical officer, community health, acute hospitals and services for older people. The purpose of this group is to engage formally with the HSE to oversee the implementation of a strategy to combat health care associated infection and anti-microbial resistance. The HSE has submitted its national service plan for 2006 to the group and this is under consideration. The Department is continuing to engage with the HSE to agree on a series of actions over the next period of time so that MRSA can be effectively dealt with so as to see a reduction in the incidence and effects of these infections.

I also take it that his reference to "other non-established civil servants" relates to ministerial advisers employed as non-established civil servants and does not include other non-established civil servants whose functions, generally, are not related to the provision of advice in, for example, evaluators under the national development plan, NDP, and community support framework, CSF, or new entrants to the Civil Service serving the customary probationary period prior to becoming established.On that basis, the details sought are as follows: my Department did not have contracts with media advisers or with non-established civil servants as ministerial advisers in the period. I would add that the staff in my Department's press and information office are all established civil servants.The table below sets out, for all the contracts my Department had in the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005 with public relations consultancy firms, the year in which the contract was awarded, the year in which the contract was or will be completed, whether the firm had pervious experience with a Government Department or subsidiary body, the basis of remuneration for the contract, the amount of the remuneration and the subhead of Vote 6, Office of the Minister for Finance, from which the remuneration was paid.

The Corrib Gas field has yet to commence production and is unlikely to do so before 2008. We are fortunate to have an ongoing exploration programme with licences held by a variety of companies, some of which are multinational.The dilemma facing any Government with prospective territory is that unless it is prepared to engage in expensive and risky exploration itself, it needs to license willing private sector parties to do so. The corollary of this is that if exploration is successful, the successful explorer will be given production rights in accordance with terms known in advance. It is important, of course, that all relevant information is made available to the State. It is clear that all Governments since the mid-1970s have accepted this basic approach. Proven reserves today are modest rather than huge and it is overwhelmingly in the national interest that any additional resources are discovered and produced.

Other inputs to the group came from: direct presentations to the group from industry representatives and their associations; analysis conducted by subgroups of the group itself; and the work of the CHP strategy group and the bioenergy strategy group. The group's report will form the basis of my future policy decisions on the increased penetration of renewable energy technologies in the electricity market and will seek to ensure that developers can make a reasonable rate of return on renewable energy projects while ensuring that the interests of national competitiveness and the ultimate burden of cost to the final consumer are all fully taken into consideration.The target for renewables by 2020 will be determined in the context of the all-island electricity market. A joint North-South public consultation process on an all-island vision for renewable energy by 2020 and beyond has been undertaken and the aim is to develop a long-term strategy for renewable energy on the island as a whole. The individual responses and a synthesis paper have been posted on both Departments' websites since December last and work is ongoing between the two Departments to develop the process taking into account views of industry stakeholders.

The latest report from OPW indicated that negotiations on the purchase of a suitable site in Cavan are nearing conclusion. My Department has already provided an outline specification of our accommodation requirements to OPW and will provide a detailed brief as required by OPW.The latest information from the Public Appointments Service is that 171 expressions of interest have been received for 378 Department posts in Cavan. The process of reassigning Department staff that made a CAF application to relocate with the Department to each of the decentralised locations is under way.In line with the centrally agreed protocols, contact has been made by my Department with relevant Departments in relation to their staff who wish to move with the Department to these decentralised locations. In addition, a number of staff have been recruited recently and have signed up to decentralise to Cavan.

Cork County Council submitted a proposal to the Department in 2003 for works at Garnish pier at an estimated cost of €750,000. Last year, under the small fishery harbours programme, I allocated funding of €45,000 to Cork County Council towards pier improvement works at Garnish pier costing a total of €60,000.Garnish pier is in an area coming within the scope of the CLÁR programme. However, the current project cannot be considered for funding under the coastal development measure of that programme, which is co-funded between the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and this Department. One of the criteria for grant aid under this scheme is that only projects costing up to a maximum of €200,000 per project are funded. This project is under consideration at present under this Department's small fishery harbours programme for 2006.

At the request of the defence team, and given in particular the on-going concern about the safety of the three people, the Department agreed to advance funds to cover the bond on the basis of a firm undertaking to repay the money involved. The decision was taken exclusively on consular grounds and was neither discussed nor taken at political level. The funds in question were repaid in full.

Documentary evidence must be provided to confirm an applicant's entitlement to Irish citizenship when first making an application for a passport. On the basis of the information provided by the Deputy, it is not clear on what precise basis the person in question is claiming citizenship. I will therefore outline the requirements which may apply in this case.As I understand from the Deputy's correspondence, the person in question was born in the US. He would be automatically entitled to Irish citizenship if one of his parents was born in Ireland, as seems to be suggested. The passport office would require the birth certificate and marriage certificate of the parent to show that he-she was born in Ireland and that the person in question was, therefore, entitled to citizenship. Inquiries concerning birth registration in Ireland should be made to the General Register Office, Government Offices, Convent Road, Roscommon. Telephone LoCall: 1890 252076. If such inquiries have been made but have been unsuccessful in tracing his father's birth record, the person in question should contact the passport office to establish what alternative evidence of birth in Ireland might be acceptable.However, if it is the case that the person in question and both of his parents were born outside of Ireland and that he is claiming citizenship through a grandparent born in Ireland, then he would be required to have his birth entered on the foreign births register held by my Department before he would be eligible to apply for a passport. Relevant birth and marriage certificates would be required in support of this.It would be best if the Deputy would ask the person in question to make contact with the passport officer at telephone 01 6733046. We could then try to help clarify his claim to citizenship and also advise him on how best to proceed.

This is subject to any relevant extradition provisions and to such conditions, if any, that the Minister thinks proper.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may also consent to the transfer of a sentenced prisoner through Irish territory pursuant to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons 1983, when he is satisfied that Article 16 of that convention is applicable. The convention defines a sentence as a punishment involving deprivation of liberty ordered by a court on account of a criminal offence. As stated above, any authorisations in this area would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

I am aware of media and other reports concerning allegations that aircraft, which it is claimed may at some stage have been used in so-called extraordinary rendition operations between countries other than Ireland, might on different occasions have transited Shannon Airport. In his reply of 13 December 2005, my colleague the Minister for Transport furnished details in regard to the movements of a small number of aircraft cited in such reports. There is no authoritative basis on which to come to a view on the truth of the allegations which have been made regarding the activity of such aircraft outside our jurisdiction. Moreover, none of these reports have included any concrete evidence or specific allegations that prisoners have been transported through Irish airports or airspace as part of an extraordinary rendition operation. In the Government's contacts with the US authorities, on which I have reported to the House in considerable detail, most recently on 14 December 2005, we have been concerned above all to ensure that no extraordinary rendition of prisoners has occurred or is occurring through Ireland. The assurances that we have received from the US authorities that this is indeed the case have been categorical and unambiguous, and have been repeated as recently as last week. I should add that our complete opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition has been made clear on numerous occasions.

The Government is completely opposed to such abductions and there is no question of any involvement on our part. I am not aware of any suggestion that such activities, which would be illegal under Irish law, might have been carried out on the State's territory. Questions relating to operational security issues within the State are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

However, in the interest of completeness, the Deputy may wish to note the following. Following a tender process, Red Dog Design were employed by the Department, on behalf of the interdepartmental presidency administrative planning group, for work relating to the design and branding for the EU Presidency and the launch of the Presidency logo. The company was paid €43,461.37 in 2003 for this work. The same company was paid €23,466.74 in 2004 for a promotion campaign for the EU Presidency website. The greater part of this amount was for the purchasing of media advertising space in national newspapers and on local radio.Red Dog Design Consultants were also employed, following a tendering process, by Development Co-operation Ireland, a division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The company was paid €46,201.50 in 2003, €94,332.23 in 2004 and €61,497 in 2005 for work in relation to the design and printing of various information booklets and publications. In November 2004, following an open tender process, Development Co-operation Ireland employed Real Event Solutions to design, organise and manage a primary school competition around the theme of international development and the UN millennium development goals. The competition, which was completed in 2005, had a public relations aspect aimed at encouraging school participation, both at a regional and national level, and cost €17,204, including VAT.The Department of Foreign Affairs, through the communicating Europe initiative, provided funding in 2005 to allow the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs to engage a public relations officer to publicise its work and, in particular, the role of the Oireachtas sub-committee on European scrutiny in reviewing draft EU legislation. Two consultants were engaged by the joint committee during 2005. Jack Murray Media was paid €5,193 for work undertaken during January-March 2005 and Rachel Dalton Communications was paid €4,350.89 for work undertaken in October and November 2005.I appointed a full-time press adviser on 30 September 2004. The conditions under which the appointment was made were set by the Minister for Finance. The appointment was to a temporary, unestablished position in the Civil Service and carries no entitlement to established status, by way of limited competition or otherwise. The officer's appointment will terminate no later than the date on which I cease to hold this office. The salary currently payable, €91,382 per annum, is based on the first long-service increment point on the principal officer standard pay scale. A pension contribution based on 11% of salary is also payable by the Department. These costs are a charge on the Department's salaries subhead in the normal way. The person concerned was also my press adviser in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.Neither of the two Ministers of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has appointed a press or media adviser. One press office, which is headed by my press adviser, serves the whole of the Department. An information officer is attached to the Department's Development Co-operation directorate to manage Development Co-operation Ireland's public information policy and strategy. This includes responsibility for publications and for media communications. The officer concerned is employed on the basis of a fixed-term contract and is, therefore, unestablished. The officer has had no previous experience with Departments or subsidiary bodies. The current salary applicable in this case is €68,485 per annum, which is the fourth point on a salary scale ranging from €61,570 to €70,789. This cost is a charge against the salaries subhead under Vote 29, international co-operation. A consultancy contract also provides assistance to the directorate in the management of its public information policy and strategy. The contract value is €34,880 and covers the period August 2005-06. The consultant concerned worked as a stagiaire with the Department during the last Presidency. This cost is a charge against the consultancy services subhead under Vote 29, international co-operation.A short-term contract to assist in the planning and design of a comprehensive communications strategy for Development Co-operation Ireland was recently advertised on the Government procurement website. The objective is to identify ways of making the aid programme better known to the public. Six companies have been short-listed and will be invited to submit tenders over the coming weeks.

In the particular circumstances, as raised by the Deputy, I have asked that our embassy in Sofia convey the Deputy's interest in the case, which we share, to the British authorities. Notwithstanding our lack of a formal role in this case, I will also ask the embassy to communicate this interest to the Bulgarian authorities.

The first such contract was awarded in June 2003 following a competitive tendering process. Following a second competitive tendering process in November 2004 Murray Consultants Limited were then awarded another contract from December 2004, which is due to expire shortly. The current contract with Murray Consultants provides for a retainer fee of €4,500 per month payable in arrears plus reasonable vouched expenses towards costs incurred in carrying out the contract such as mileage, telephone and postage costs. Payment is made from my Department's consultancy subhead. No payments are made under the heading miscellaneous.Murray Consultants Limited stated in its tender documentation that it has undertaken work for the Department of Health and Children, the Revenue Commissioners, Fáilte Ireland, the Enterprise Strategy Group, the Higher Education Authority, the national pensions reserve fund and the International Fund for Ireland.

Such legislation describes an employee as "a person of any age who has entered into or works under (or, where the employment has ceased, entered into or worked under) a contract of employment". However, in some employments, a "normal retirement age" exists for that employment only.In relation to redundancy, the redundancy review group report of 2002, which produced recommendations for the updating of statutory redundancy legislation, considered that increasing the upper age limit of 66 for redundancy qualification purposes would not be a priority in the short- term if resources were scarce. The group recognised however that the labour force is becoming older and that participation in the labour force by older people, if desired, should be facilitated. Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration should be given in the medium term to removing the age cap or raising the age cap in conjunction with similar changes to unfair dismissals, equality and social and family legislation as recommended by the Equality Authority. In this connection, the upper age limit of 66 for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001 was removed by the Equality Act 2004. The effect of this amendment is that the Unfair Dismissals Acts will not apply to dismissed employees who, at the date of their dismissal, had reached the normal retirement age in that employment, that is, if it is the policy in an employment to retire employees at a certain age, an employee who has reached that age is excluded from taking a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001.

My Department has been advised of the decision and is making arrangements to put the claim into payment. Relevant notes of the appeal hearing will be provided to the appellant on request.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

In the context of the issues raised by the Deputy in Question No. 742, the Pensions Board has recommended that retirees should be offered the option of deferring drawing their social welfare pension in exchange for a larger pension starting at a later date. A very approximate calculation indicates that deferring a pension from age 65 to 70 could allow a pension from the later age that would be one third higher than the entitlement at 65, or a little over 6% for each year that payment is deferred. The Pensions Board has also raised the possibility of combining this with social insurance contributions made after 65/66 years of age to improve a person's basic pension entitlement.In principle, I support allowing people to improve their social welfare pension entitlements through further employment or deferring payment. However, such arrangements do give rise to very practical issues in the operation of occupational defined benefit schemes, which are generally integrated with the social welfare pension. It is likely to be some time before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support a system on the lines suggested by the Pensions Board but I will be keeping the matter under review.

This reflects the fact that 86% of all road deaths can be attributed to driver behaviour in its broadest sense.The remaining offences to which the penalty point system is to be applied, and which are set out in the first schedule to the Road Traffic Act 2002 as subsequently amended, relate primarily to offences in the categories relating to vehicles and their use, lighting of vehicles and the licensing of drivers.

I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 113, answered on 17 February 2005. The Department has, on limited occasions, employed outside professional public relations advice. Tony O'Brien Communications was employed in 2004 to assist the Department with media relations and was paid a fee of approximately €6,000. Laurie Cearr Associates was employed by the Department for the organisation and management of public relations activities and other work in 2002 and in 2004 and was paid approximately €15,000 in total.

The NRA now proposes to remove the West Link toll plaza in 2008 and to install a barrier free toll system on the M50. The move to free flow tolling on the M50 will require the completion by the NRA of a comprehensive traffic study and will be subject to the statutory procedures applicable to the making of a toll scheme. The NRA's specific proposals, following the completion of the traffic study, for the tolling of the M50 will be submitted for the approval of the Government.In parallel with its work on the traffic study, the NRA will shortly initiate a public procurement process to select a free flow toll operator. Details of future tolling rates and other aspects of the toll regime will be determined on the basis of the outcome of the traffic study and this will include consideration of potential traffic diversion rates. The compensation payable to NTR will be a matter for negotiation in the first instance between the parties to the West Link toll agreement in accordance with the terms of that agreement.

The Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs report on volunteers and volunteering in Ireland advanced a number of proposals on this topic in its recommendations last year on volunteering. Subsequently, I launched a range of measures to support volunteering. While I have concerns to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy relating to an awards scheme recognising volunteering and community work, I am disposed to keep the matter under consideration for any further initiatives in support of volunteering.

The programme covers areas in 18 counties, with a population of 362,000, including areas I announced in January 2003 in light of the 2002 population census data. The average population loss in the selected areas is 50%. The exception is the Cooley peninsula, which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. CLÁR funds or co-funds, together with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a wide range of measures and reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the start of the programme. This funding helps rural communities overcome local difficulties and achieve access to a range of essential services such as water supply, sewerage disposal, road access, broadband communication, community and economic infrastructure, etc. I intend to continue these procedures for any new measures I may introduce, depending on needs identified. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures.Expenditure under the CLÁR programme amounted to over €48 million from 2002-05, which, it is estimated, leveraged out a further €53 million, approximately, in related public and private expenditure in those years. I am satisfied that the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas are being met through the efficient and effective delivery of the programme and that CLÁR is making a sustained and strong positive contribution to rural communities.My Department also funds a range of other programmes such as the Leader programme, the rural social scheme, Gaeltacht and island schemes, etc. which address rural depopulation in a general way through key interventions and supports. Information on these programmes is available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.

The regulations to give legal effect to the nitrates action programme were signed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in December 2005 and came into effect on 1 February 2006.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and my Department engaged in prolonged and difficult discussions with the European Commission on Ireland's proposals to implement the nitrates directive. During that process Teagasc was consulted on an ongoing basis on the content of the various drafts of the action programme, the regulations and the proposals for a derogation from the general limit for organic nitrogen.The nitrates directive requires legal certainty in the implementation of the action programme. In that context the Commission indicated that the fertilisation standards, based on crop needs, must be expressed as legally binding standards. The critical tables on nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisation rates in the regulations are in line with good agricultural practice and the agronomic requirements of crops as defined by Teagasc.The board of Teagasc indicated recently that it may be possible to review part of its previous advice as regards phosphorous limits in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. Subsequently the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced on 27 January 2006 that, in consultation with the European Commission, he has agreed to a short deferral of Part 3 of the regulations.Both the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have made it clear that if revised phosphorus tables are brought forward by Teagasc and supported by robust underlying science, then the Government is prepared to make a case to the European Commission whose agreement is required for any revision to the current limits.

Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and who had leased out his-her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000-02. Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year. In addition, the farmer must have either purchased or inherited land.It should be noted, however, that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him-her.The position is that over 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. My Department will be in touch with the individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed and formal letters setting out my Department's decision will be issued in the near future.

Similarly, any employee commencing their additional unpaid maternity or adoptive leave on or after 1 March 2006 will benefit from the increased entitlement this year. The second phase of increases will be effective from 1 March 2007. The implementation dates of these increases are consistent with the financial statement made by the Minister for Finance on 7 December last.As regards the situation of mothers who are commencing maternity leave before 1 March 2006, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 1056 and 1057 of Wednesday, 25 January 2006, and my detailed reply to Question No. 288 of Wednesday, 14 December 2005.

I am further informed that both complaints were thoroughly investigated by the Garda Síochána and that extensive investigation files were submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. In both instances, the DPP directed that no prosecutions be initiated, as no evidence was adduced of any unlawful activity.I am also informed that a third complaint was made in general terms in November 2005. The complainant in the case was interviewed by the Garda Síochána. However, inquiries to date have not resulted in prima facie evidence of a criminal offence being established.

However, further consideration is being given by the office to an alternative approach, in consultation with my Department and the Garda authorities. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible at this time to indicate when a new Garda station will be provided at Kilfinane.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	644	The problem of joyriding is a complex one which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can only be tackled to lasting effect through a multifaceted and multi-agency response involving the community and relevant statutory bodies.I have been informed that the Garda Síochána operates special foot and mobile patrols which target specific areas in response to identified local requirements. In co-operation with local authorities, good progress has been made in recent years in relation to estate management which is actively reducing the opportunities for so called joyriding. For example, physical changes, such as barriers and speed ramps, are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities. Furthermore, gardaí are constantly in liaison with community groups, and a number of projects are operating which have proved valuable in dealing with offences.My Department provides funding for 64 Garda youth diversion projects, GYDPs, which are in operation nationwide. GYDPs primarily target at-risk youths who have come to the notice of the gardaí for crime and antisocial behaviours including joyriding. Project participants are actively encouraged to develop and become positive contributors to society. Various methodologies are utilised to progress issues which challenge behaviours. One such initiative was organised by the Boyne GYDP in Drogheda and involved the participants in the production, direction and editing of a video entitled "Clutch It" which focused on joyriding as an antisocial behaviour which affected their environment. The production is currently being considered by other projects as a method of tackling joyriding issues.This year, a budget of €6.6 million has been secured for the youth diversion programme, which represents an increase of €1.2 million on 2005. I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, the expansion of GYDPs and I intend to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007. I have therefore asked the Garda Commissioner to bring forward proposals for further community based initiatives in this area in light of the additional funding.My Department has also provided funding to the Priorswood taskforce on joyriding to tackle the causes of so-called joyriding in the areas of Darndale, Moatview and Belcamp. This strategy involves developing joint initiatives with local agencies and the community in order to prevent young people from joyriding. The taskforce engages with joyriders, including those in custody, to develop alternatives in education, training and leisure. Attention is also given to developing appropriate models of family support. The taskforce targets the physical improvement of the locality in order to discourage joyriding with the result that Dublin City Council have undertaken practical building works to assist in prevention. The taskforce gave a presentation to GYDP co-ordinators in Cork in May 2005, which raised the awareness of the issues around joyriding behaviour.I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department, through the probation and welfare service, provides funding to a community based initiative, the Cork auto-crime diversion project, which specifically tackles joyriding. The Cork auto-crime diversion project was established in 1995 as an initiative to combat the high level of auto-crime in the greater Cork area. This programme caters for 15-19 years old males and focuses, inter alia, on life skills, motor skills and personal development with a view to participants obtaining work experience and full-time employment. I have approved a grant of €200,000 for Cork auto-crime diversion project for 2006.Management of the Probation and Welfare Service have advised that the initiative in Cork has proved successful in addressing the criminal attitudes and antisocial behaviour of young male offenders in the Cork area. Twenty-three young male clients of the probation and welfare service engaged with Cork auto-crime diversion project programmes during 2005. The programme has also achieved success in placing many of its participants on FÁS courses, work experience and permanent employment.I am confident that the implementation of the various anti-joyriding strategies and initiatives which I have outlined will significantly contribute to reducing the incidence of this dangerous and illegal practice in communities.

His Department has issued a leaflet entitled A Guide to the Noise Regulations which outlines the steps which can be taken where a person is experiencing nuisance caused by noise.This is primarily a civil matter and as such is outside the remit of the Garda Síochána. However, when gardaí receive a complaint about neighbours causing noise, they can request them to lower the noise levels. The Garda powers in this regard relate to ensuring that a breach of the peace does not occur. Complainants may also be advised by gardaí of their civil entitlements under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.The Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 was enacted to make further and better provision for the protection of the environment and the control of pollution and to establish the Environmental Protection Agency.A local authority, the agency or any person may complain to the District Court regarding any noise, which is so loud, so continuous, so repeated and of such duration or pitch or occurring at such a time, as to give reasonable cause for annoyance. The court may order the person or body making the noise to take the measures necessary to reduce the noise to a specified level or to take measures to limit or prevent the noise.An authorised person, shall, for any purpose connected with the Act, be entitled, at all reasonable times, to enter any premises and to bring therein such other persons, including members of the Garda Síochána. An offence under the Act may be prosecuted summarily by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Applicants who fail to meet the necessary application criteria may be refused an age card.In summary, the relevant age card regulations — the full regulations are set out in SI 4 of 1999 — are as follows: applicants must have attained the age of 18 years and shall present his or her application in writing, on the designated application form, to the Garda station in the area in which he or she resides. The application form must be accompanied by the applicant's birth certificate, at least one other document confirming identity, two recent identical passport sized photographs and the prescribed fee of €6.The current monthly average of age cards processed is 4,327. The period from receipt of a correct application to delivery of the card is now 21 days on average. A number of factors have in the past contributed to delays. The provision of additional staff has, in the main, addressed this problem.The Garda authorities continuously monitor the scheme to ensure that it takes account of changing circumstances and is improved as necessary. With this aim in view, a tendering process for the development of a upgraded age card, with enhanced security features, is in train, in co-operation with the Government supplies agency. This will enable the national age card office to devote increased attention to quality assurance issues.

Confirming that intelligence gathering by the Garda in relation to specific persons or groups is ongoing could in certain circumstances result in a lessening in the success of such work. This would be contrary to the public interest.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The person referred to by the Deputy was a dual asylum applicant. He applied for asylum in the State on two separate occasions, that is, 9 August 2000 and 7 November 2002. In each case, he used different identities. This came to light due to finger printing of the applicant in the second asylum application.His first asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The person concerned was informed by letter dated 15 February 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to make written representations within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why he should not be deported.His first case was examined further under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 — prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to his representations for temporary leave to remain in the State lodged on his behalf by the refugee legal service by letter dated 7 March 2002. A deportation order was made in respect of him on 21 August 2002. Notice of this order was served on him by registered post requiring him to present himself to the gardaí in Henry Street, Limerick on 13 September 2002. He presented as required and was given a further presentation date of 20 September 2002. He failed to present on that date and was classified as an evader.In his second application, the person referred to by the Deputy attended ORAC on 3 April 2003 for interview. Following a fingerprint check by ORAC, it was discovered that the person concerned was a dual asylum applicant. The gardaí were contacted and the person concerned was detained on foot of the original deportation order for 55 days. He was released on 28 May 2003 and given a letter by the gardaí requiring him to present himself again at the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, on 13 June 2003 for the purposes of arranging his removal from the State. He failed to present and is now being sought by the GNIB for deportation.It is clear that the person concerned intended to frustrate the system by making two asylum applications under different identities and failing to keep his appointments with the GNIB. I would urge him to come forward and present himself to the gardaí without delay. His removal from the State is now an operational matter for the GNIB.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	660	It is absurd to state that there has been a dramatic increase in headline crime for 2005 when the level of headline crime for 2005 is 4.4% lower than the level for 2002. I did not hear the Deputy opposite state that there was a dramatic fall in headline crime when there was a decrease of 3% recorded for 2003 compared to 2002 and a further decrease in headline crime of 4% recorded for 2004 compared to 2003. Since I took the decision to publish crime statistics on a quarterly basis at the beginning of 2003, I have consistently emphasised that care must be taken in interpreting the statistics, especially when considering short-term fluctuations and extrapolating trends over short periods.I wish to touch on long-term crime patterns. The level of headline crime in 2005 is actually lower than that for 2003 by 1.6% and for 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore, in 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population. Our headline crime rate continues to compare very favourably with those of our nearest neighbours. In England and Wales in the year April 2003 to March 2004, the most recent for which figures are available, 113 crimes were committed per 1,000 population. In 2004 and 2005 in Scotland there were 86.3 crimes per 1,000 population and in Northern Ireland 69 per 1,000 population compared with our rate of 24.6 per 1,000.There have been significant reductions in 2005 in the incidence of manslaughter, down 50%; aggravated sexual assault, down 43%; robbery of cash and goods in transit, down 27%; robbery from the person, down 23%; and theft from the person, down 18%. However, the overall increase in recorded crime and the increases in particular categories in the most recent figures I published are disappointing, and I will not downplay my concerns in that respect.I welcome the significant decrease of 27% in the number of incidents of robbery of cash and goods in transit, which is down from 62 in 2004 to 45 in 2005. This trend improved in the fourth quarter, with a decrease of 47%. Operation Delivery, an initiative undertaken by the Garda Síochána to counteract the increase in cash in transit robberies which emerged in 2004, has contributed significantly to this very welcome decrease. Furthermore, the new code of practice now being operated by the major financial institutions and security companies involved in the cash in transit industry has dramatically raised the standards in operation. I took a direct personal hand in dialogue with the leadership in the banking and security sectors in securing adoption of this new code. It has made a significant contribution to this decrease. These developments have been underpinned by the establishment of the private security authority, which has also taken place "on my watch".I also welcome the increase in the number of detections for possession of drugs for sale or supply, up 20%, and possession of firearms, up16%. In both cases these are offences which in the main become known as a result of active police detection work. This trend continued in the fourth quarter and, in the case of possession of firearms, improved, with an increase of 24%. These are statistical crime figure increases which we should welcome because they are detections flowing from increased police vigilance and a proactive approach.Operation Anvil, which the Commissioner introduced last May and for which I obtained substantial additional resources, made a significant contribution to this level of detection. Operation Anvil will continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational and policing terms. At my request, the Commissioner has extended Operation Anvil to Garda divisions outside Dublin. The most recent figures available to me show that Operation Anvil has contributed to encouraging outcomes, with a total number of arrests of 1,522, which includes 17 arrests for murder, 310 arrests for serious assaults, 629 arrests for burglary and 280 arrests for robbery offences. Furthermore, the total number of firearms seized to date under Operation Anvil is 347, and property to the value of more than €5.5 million has been recovered.While it is the case that a number of the increases in headline crime statistics reflect increased enforcement activity on the part of the Garda Síochána, the overall picture indicates that there is no room for complacency. The Government's decision to continue to devote unprecedented resources to the fight against crime is clearly justified, as is my insistence that those resources be deployed at the front line of policing in this State. The Garda Síochána this year has the highest level of resources in its history —€1,290 million — an increase of €146 million or 13% on 2005. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is €83.5 million — an increase of €23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly assist the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The €83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.I take great satisfaction in the Government's decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006 and 14,000 attested Gardaí in two years' time. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.In addition to this increase in resources, I am also bringing forward proposals to strengthen significantly the legislative provisions available. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. It addresses such matters as the preservation of crime scenes, increased periods of detention in the case of arrestable offences, search warrant powers for the Garda Síochána, amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990, provision for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain lesser public order offences and the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements.The Garda Síochána policing plan for 2006, recently published by the Commissioner, includes a targeted reduction in the incidence of crime by 2% and an increase in detection rates by 2%. It also reflects the Government's priorities in the fight against crime and the actions which it wishes to be taken. I can assure Deputies that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling crime under continuing review.

Under this Government's first term in office, the strength of the force was increased steadily and when I took up office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June 2002, the strength of the Garda Síochána stood at 11,748.After June 2002, and despite the cap on public service numbers announced in the budget of 2002, I proceeded with Government approval to increase the strength of the force to 12,200 by 2004, and I am pleased to say that target was achieved on time. On 31 December 2005 the strength of the force increased to 12,264. This represents an increase of 1,296, or 12%, in the strength of the Garda Síochána since 1997.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as indicated when I announced the Government decision in October 2004 to proceed with this expansion of the organisation. Garda management advise me that the first incremental increase of attested gardaí due to the accelerated recruitment will take place next month, March 2006. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college between 1 January 2005 and 1 January 2006, as set out in the table below:IntakeRecruitsDateA2757/2/2005B2753/5/2005C2752/8/2005D3007/11/2005The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. In this regard, the Garda authorities plan that intakes of 275 student gardaí will commence training in 2006 on the dates as set out hereunder:IntakeRecruitsDateA2756/2/2006B2751/5/2006C2757/8/2006D2756/11/2006The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The project to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 is fully on target and will be achieved. The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government.The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006 and 14,000 attested Gardaí in two years' time. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.In addition to this increase in resources, I am also bringing forward proposals to strengthen significantly the legislative provisions available. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. It addresses such matters as the preservation of crime scenes,increased periods of detention in the case of arrestable offences, search warrant powers for the Garda Síochána, amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, provision for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain lesser public order offences and the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements.The Garda Síochána policing plan for 2006, recently published by the Commissioner, includes a targeted reduction in the incidence of crime by 2% and an increase in detection rates by 2%. It also reflects the Government's priorities in the fight against crime and the actions which it wishes to be taken. I can assure Deputies that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling crime under continuing review.

The first category consists of individuals or groups that are well-established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.The Garda authorities estimate that there is a total of between 45 and 50 criminal gangs in these two categories currently operating within this jurisdiction. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the position of criminal gangs does not remain static. Such groups are volatile. Their composition changes frequently and their existence can be of variable duration. There is continuous networking and a certain level of co-operation in bringing together individuals with particular expertise to participate in specific crimes.Estimation of the number of criminal gangs operating here remains an important part of the criminal intelligence analysis process, which is an ongoing exercise in the Garda Síochána.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	665	I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 187 together.I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána as at 31 January 2006 was 12,228, all ranks. The personnel strength of the Carlow and Kildare division as at 31 December 1997 was 281, all ranks, and as at 31 January 2006 was 332, all ranks. This represents an increase of 51, or 18%, in the number of Garda personnel allocated to the Carlow and Kildare division in that period.The allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. In this regard the Commissioner takes into account a number of factors including population, crime trends and the operational policing needs of each division. Garda management further states that for security and operational reasons it is not Garda policy to disclose the number of gardaí working in any particular area at any specific time. I add that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective.Garda management advises me that the first incremental increase of attested gardaí from the accelerated recruitment will take place in March 2006. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. In this regard, the Garda authorities plan that intakes of 275 student gardaí will commence training in 2006 on the dates set out hereunder:IntakeRecruitsDateA2756/2/2006B2751/5/2006C2757/8/2006D2756/11/2006The project to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 is fully on target and will be achieved.The Commissioner is now drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

He withdrew this application on 28 January 2001 and applied for permission to remain based solely on his parentage of an Irish-born child. He was granted residency in the State on this basis on 9 January 2002.On 18 July 2003 the Government announced its policy on leave to remain for parents of Irish-born children. A feature of that policy was that there would be no presumption in favour of allowing parents granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child to be joined in the State by other family members, including other children.I am not aware of any special circumstances over and above those of others in a similar situation which would warrant a special concession in this case.

The average processing time for applications for naturalisation for standard adults is approximately 24 months at present. However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible, having regard to the general volume of applications on hands. It is likely that the application of the person concerned will be finalised in the early part of 2007. I will be in touch with both the Deputy and the applicant when the case is finalised.

Her transfer to Belgium, where she sought asylum in April 2005, is now an operational matter for the Garda national immigration bureau.I have been informed by officials in the citizenship section of my Department that there is no record of an application for naturalisation being received from the person concerned. Since she has only been present in the State for a few months and does not belong to one of the categories of applicants for whom I am empowered to waive the residency requirement, refugee or stateless person, it appears unlikely that she is eligible to apply for naturalisation.

It is not possible at this point to indicate when the architectural planning process will be completed. There are five stages in this process and the timeframe for completing these stages is contingent on various factors including any unexpected issues that may arise, the period of time for the granting of planning permission, obtaining a fire certificate and so forth.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	675	Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, insert additional institutions in the Schedule to the Act. In order that an institution be considered under section 4, it must be an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a children's home, a special school for children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness. It must also be one in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.The case raised by the Deputy concerns the Regina Coeli Hostel which provided shelter for homeless women, mothers with young children and expectant mothers. However, as hostel facilities do not come within the scope of section 4 of the Act, it is not open to me to consider the inclusion of this institution in the Schedule. The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	679	From 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education has taken over key functions from the Department in special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of the Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities-special needs.The provision of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and other health related supports is a matter for the Health Service Executive. However, the NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities-special needs. The responsibilities of the NCSE include deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant hours; processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs.Under the new arrangements, where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local special educational needs organiser for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil. The SENO will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.The precise model of provision made available will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible. The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education.The Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. The advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.The Department has requested the NCSE to confirm the current position on any application for resources in respect of the pupil referred to by the Deputy. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it received.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	680	A new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas over the current school year. Laytown, Mornington and Bettystown in County Meath are included in the pilot scheme as part of an overall plan for the north Dublin-east Meath-south Louth area. The need for a new post-primary school in that area will be considered in this context.The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties in the locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.Arising from this process, an individual plan will set out the blueprint for the future of educational provision in an area, which will be the basis against which all decisions in relation to capital investment will be made in the next decade.The draft plan for the north Dublin-east Meath and south Louth area is close to completion in the school planning section of the Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.

The person to whom the Deputy refers resides 1.28 km from the bus route and therefore has a level of service which is within the Department's guidelines. In the circumstances, a re-routing of service at additional cost is not warranted.

It relates to whether a particular course undertaken outside of this jurisdiction was in keeping with the requirements of the architects directive EU Directive, 85/384/EEC. The Department has no function in the course in question. Matters relating to the directive come within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have referred the relevant papers to him for consideration.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	684	From the latest information provided by the post-primary pupil database it is estimated that just over 3,000 pupils left full-time education without a junior certificate in second level schools aided by this Department between October 2003 and June 2004. It should be remembered that many of those who leave school without a formal qualification proceed to various other education and training programmes, including Youthreach, as well as to pursue educational opportunities outside the State in the case of students who emigrated with their families.Data from the Central Statistics Office highlight the inadequacy of any assumption that considering only what qualifications young people get in the formal school system gives one a fair picture of their level of educational achievement.CSO figures indicate that the number of persons aged 20 to 24 who had attained at least a leaving certificate or equivalent level of education or training increased between 1999 and 2004. This growth reflects the increasing numbers of students now participating in second chance further education and training programmes. The level of educational attainment of Irish young people is ahead of the EU average on that measure.My Department has taken a number of initiatives in recent years to encourage more of our young people to finish school, including the setting up of the National Educational Welfare Board and the provision of extra supports for those at risk of dropping out through the school completion programme and home school community liaison scheme. Also, under the new action plan for educational inclusion, the DEIS initiative, which I launched last May, further resources are being provided to schools serving the most disadvantaged communities to help them to improve their retention rates.The Government has pursued a dual strategy of both encouraging more young people to finish school and ensuring much greater second chance and further education opportunities for those who left school early. This kind of strategy seeks to ensure that young people can achieve their full potential, be that by sitting the State exams or by pursuing qualifications through other pathways such as FÁS apprenticeships which may be more appropriate to their individual interests.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	694	A number of legislative measures are in place to address the issue of noise nuisance. Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department and on the Department's website, www.environ.ie.In the case of noise nuisance being caused by individuals in private rented accommodation, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 imposes minimum statutory obligations on landlords and tenants of private residential tenancies. Tenant obligations under the Act include an obligation not to engage, or allow visitors to engage, in anti-social behaviour which is defined as including persistent noise that interferes with the peaceful occupation of other dwellings in the neighbourhood. The Act also imposes an obligation on landlords to enforce the tenant obligations. There is provision in the Act for third parties, adversely affected by a failure on the part of a landlord to enforce the tenant obligations, to refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board in accordance with the procedures in the Act. However, it should be noted with regard to the board's dispute resolution service, that if an alternative legal remedy, such as the remedy provided for under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, is available and is pursued by a person, that person may not also refer the matter to the board.Noise nuisance and other problems caused by local authority tenants are also covered under legislation. The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to the type of behaviour that is acceptable and that which is not. The local authority is empowered under section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement. I am satisfied that adequate statutory provisions are in place to address neighbourhood noise nuisance. My Department consults and liaises with other Departments and local authorities on associated issues on an ongoing basis.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-02 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2005 have been designed to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources. The regulations give effect to the EU nitrates directive of 1991 and a number of other directives relating to water quality. They provide for compliance by Ireland with the terms of the judgment of the European Court of Justice delivered in March 2004 which held that Ireland was non-compliant with the nitrates directive. The regulations generally came into effect on 1 February 2006 with specific provisions coming into effect on a phased basis up to 2008.Part 3 of the regulations deals with nutrient management planning and is based on long-standing Teagasc advice. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of this advice on the application of phosphorus in a way which could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, I have announced a brief de facto deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations. Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. My Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc having regard to the fact that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables must respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and will require the agreement of the Commission.
