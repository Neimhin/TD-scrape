#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Yesterday, Ryanair launched a third bid to buy the remaining shares of Aer Lingus.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, obviously conscious of Deputy Keaveney breathing down his neck, has responded by saying he will consult his Government colleagues.  The Minister said earlier this year or last year that the sale of the 25% share of Aer Lingus would only go ahead to the right buyer at the right price.  We did not know whether that implicitly ruled out Ryanair.  It seemed to at the time and in the context of the remarks.The fundamental question is whether the Government has assessed the competition issues surrounding such a bid, the strategic considerations and the impact on consumers.  On the first occasion in 2007, the European Commission undertook an in-depth investigation and assessment of the Ryanair bid for the remaining share of Aer Lingus.  At that time it came to definitive conclusions that such a takeover would be very harmful to competition and would create a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties, leading to increased fares for 14 million European Union passengers.  There is a strong competition issue here and I would like to hear the Government's position on that aspect of the takeover.From a strategic perspective, as an island nation, connectivity is key to economic recovery, exports and tourism.  The Taoiseach himself in 2007 was strong on the strategic assets the Heathrow slots represented for Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  Most people identified the Aer Lingus shares and the Heathrow slots as being of significant strategic value.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the Dáil if it is the Government's plan to sell the remaining shares in Aer Lingus and the Government's position on the Ryanair bid?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	1	It should be borne in mind that when Fianna Fáil was in government, it made the decision to sell 75% of Aer Lingus and Ryanair could have been in a position to own this airline in its entirety.  It is always good for Ministers to consult each other.  We have had examples in the past of Ministers going on solo runs without reference to the responsibility they had in a collegiate sense.The issue here is that the State holds a minority stake in this airline.  The Government will consider the bid but it has not collectively considered the competition issue raised by the Deputy.  We have made it perfectly clear that the Government, in accordance with the negotiations being worked out with the troika on the memorandum of understanding, is giving consideration to a list of State assets to be disposed of, and in the consideration of any such asset being disposed of, the Government will not be forced into any fire sale and will give proper and appropriate consideration to the right timing and the right price in the best interests of the country and the people.As we meet this morning, I understand the regulatory authorities and the European Commission are meeting on this matter.  Their position will be fundamental as far as regulation of this is concerned.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that the Government would be concerned in terms of competition, consumer facilities in terms of price, access to the country and all of these things.  It is, however, a minority share the Government has and we do not have any veto over this.  We have no blocking rights.  The details of the offer made by Ryanair have not yet been considered collectively by Government.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The European Commission did a thorough investigative analysis and assessment of the competition implications of a Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus.  That is central to this in terms of the impact on the country and the impact on consumers through the creation of a dominant monopoly position.  It is an indictment of the Government, given it declared long before it came into office that it wanted to sell State assets.  This was something to which the Government, particularly Fine Gael, committed itself.  With the greatest of respect, the Tánaiste, Ministers of State such as Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Shortall, and many other Labour Party Deputies would be incandescent with rage if they were on this side of the House, demanding answers from Government.  They had a clear position on the strategic importance of Aer Lingus and the impact on consumers and workers.  The fundamental point is that it is incumbent on the Government to protect competition because Ryanair has been a success because of competition across the European zone and the creation of a competitive environment.  The Government should oppose the bid to protect competition, protect consumers and ensure connectivity to this country at a reasonable rate of low fares on a continuing competitive basis.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Government has looked in detail over the past six months at the question of a definitive list of State assets that can be disposed of from a regulatory point of view, a competitive point of view and an economic point of view.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government, have been involved in intense discussions and assessments regarding these issues.This bid came in yesterday evening and, as we meet, I understand the European Commission, which has a specific responsibility in respect of competition and regulation, is meeting on it.  When Deputy Martin asks the Government's position, the position is that the Government will publish its own definitive list of State assets for disposal.  We have made it perfectly clear that in respect of each and every one of those, they would only be disposed of in accordance with best principles in the interests of the country and the people at the right time and at the appropriate price.There may be other elements to an agenda in respect of this bid but I am concerned, as we would be, given this is an island, that the only access to here is by ferry or by air.  Ryanair has done much good during the years in providing competition to ensure lower air fares for hundreds of millions of passengers, but clearly there are implications if there is a monopoly for the benefits of good competition for consumers in terms of air fares.  Access by air to Ireland is important in terms of the way business is conducted.  Therefore, from that point of view, these are fundamental matters to the economy.  The Government will consider the bid, but we do not have a blocking mechanism or a veto.

Bhí ionadh an domhain orm ar maidin nuair a léigh mé faoi na páístí a fuair bás agus iad i gcúram an Stáit.It is deeply shocking that at the height of the Celtic tiger 196 young people died while in the care of the State or in contact with child protection services.  This morning's media coverage of the report to be released later makes distressing reading.  A total of 112 of these deaths were due to unnatural causes such as drug overdoses, suicides, unlawful killings or road traffic accidents and the report finds that earlier and more consistent intervention could have helped these children to overcome their vulnerabilities.  Sinn Féin has warmly welcomed the work done by the Government, including the appointment of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald's work and commend and welcome the publication of the heads of the Children First Bill, but these children and their families were failed by the State.  It is a long way from cherishing all the children of the nation equally-----

Where is the equality for these families?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the injustices identified in the report relating to the systems of care for vulnerable children and young people have been rectified?  Have the required resources, including personnel such as social workers, been put in place to ensure the child protection services are fit for purpose, which is crucially important?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Go raibh maith again as ucht a cheist, a Theachta.  This is obviously an independent report and I commend Dr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Norah Gibbons for their clarity and the research and analysis they carried out in what is a harrowing tale and litany of shame in many respects.  I recall asking questions when in opposition during Leaders' Questions and so on about work that had been done principally by Deputy Alan Shatter at the time in trying to ascertain the numbers of children involved.  There was great confusion about them.  The answer given by the then Government was that the number was 20, 25 or 27, but we now know the facts.  The independent inquiry was commissioned by the former Minister of State with responsibility for children, former Deputy Barry Andrews.The report deals with the lives of 196 children who at some stage or other were known to the HSE.  There were 112 unnatural deaths, of which 17 occurred while in the care of the HSE.  The report will speak for itself when it is published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs later.  This occurred, as the Deputy pointed out, during the so-called Celtic tiger days with their veneer of endless wealth.  The report is an analysis of the lives of the children concerned.  The Government has not put an end to all the difficulties clarified in it, but we have appointed a senior Minister with responsibility for children; given a guarantee to hold a referendum of the people in respect of child protection; made it mandatory to report child abuse; taken from the care of the HSE the matter of dealing of children and set up a new child protection agency which will commence its work with a separate budget on 1 January 2013; and put in place a new mechanism for dealing with children who find themselves in trouble.The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs wanted the independent report to be published in order that the truth would be known.  The names of the children are anonymised, but it is a story and a saga of shame in many respects dealing with the lives of 196 children.  Arising from all the facts now known, we want to put in place procedures and practices that will ensure that, to the best extent possible, this will not happen again.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I thank the Taoiseach for that response.  I also commend the authors of the reports.  We have seen others reports, including the Ryan report and the Tracey Fay report, on these issues and it is an indictment of the State that this happened, but it will be an indictment of all of us, regardless of our party political allegiances, if we do not rectify these matters in this term.  I make this appeal to every single Teachta Dála anseo.  Sinn Féin has commended the work of the Minister and her appointment with special responsibility for children and young people.  Can we be satisfied that the agency to be put in place will have the necessary resources?  Last week I visited a care centre where I met some of the young people in it and talked to the staff.  There is a resource issue with a huge difficulty around the capacity and availability of social workers and the resources being provided by the Government.  I ask that we all commit ourselves to making sure we rectify this grave injustice.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that resources will be supplied and capacity provided?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I should have said that 19 children had died of unnatural causes.  It is clear from the report that complex social issues are involved such as family circumstances, the pressures on young people from drink or drugs, their background and the question of mental health.  The Deputy referred to resources being made available.  That is obviously important, but it is also important to point out that many of the children in question were the focus of attention for multiple agencies.  It is not just a question of resources; it is also a question of providing an effective response for the taxpayer's money through the facilities made available under whatever agency for children.  The Government in its own way will reflect on the budget.  The Minister will have the new child protection agency in operation from 1 January next and, clearly, the Government will make its own decisions about the resources that will be made available.  I stress, however, that we will not set up an agency which will not be effective in carrying out its responsibilities.  Clearly, from reading the report, multiple agencies were involved in the past and children, unfortunately, were not the recipients of the care and attention they should have received in all these circumstances.  It is an issue that we will be happy to debate in the House or at a committee whenever it is appropriate to do so.  This is something that we really want to get right.  In so far as the State can change its way and structures and oversee through the child protection agency the work, care and love that it will be necessary to give to children in order that they have a life, we will do whatever it is possible to do.  This report brings clarity and reality to a very long and sad saga.  It is the duty and responsibility of us all to ensure we take a different direction - a direction for the better - for all children in the future.  The Deputy's comments and his party's contribution to that will be as welcome as anybody else's.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus presents a double challenge to the Government.  It presents a challenge on the financial front and it presents a political challenge as well.  I note the Taoiseach's response to the leader of Fianna Fáil that it is not possible for the Government to veto the bid.  On the financial side, it looks to me as if the €1.30 offer is pretty well a no brainer.  I understand the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has said that the minimum price the State would accept is €1.  This bid of €1.30 per share puts the Government in the position where it presumably could accept the offer.On the political level, however, it is a much harder decision for the Government to take, particularly because Ryanair has played such an extraordinarily beneficial part in the country's prosperity.  The chief executive officer is a poacherpar excellence in terms of commercial activity.  This deal has the potential to convert the company from an aggressive, lean, mean, independent and challenging airline into a mega gamekeeper in terms of Irish aviation.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach’s opinion and position on this.  I accept the State does not have a veto, but it would be very dangerous if this Government, by the sale of its 25% stake to Ryanair, were to facilitate a position whereby any airline would have the sort of dominance which the competition authorities in the EU forbade on the last occasion.  Very little has changed since that time.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach would knock this particular proposal on its head here and now by saying that the Government will not facilitate - the word “allow” might not be right - any airline from anywhere getting into a position where it holds 80% of the air traffic and controls 35% of the routes into this country.  Will the Taoiseach state specifically that he will not allow a monopoly or a dominant position in airlines in this country, any more than it would be allowed in any other sector?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I repeat that the State has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus and, as the Deputy is well aware, we do not have a blocking mechanism that would allow us to prevent this bid.  The Deputy asked whether the Government would facilitate the situation by a sale of its shareholding.  We have made it perfectly clear that the Government, through the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has had detailed discussions in recent months in respect of the regulatory, competitive and economic aspects of giving consideration to assets that might be disposed of by the State.  The Government will publish its definitive list in due course.  I override that by saying that every one of those sales would only be finalised and decided upon in the best interests of the country and the people.From the perspective of the buck that was passed on the previous occasion, this is an improved offer from Ryanair for the value of the company.  It does not, however, change the fact that Government will consider the potential disposal of any asset on its merits in respect of what it means for the country and the people.  Clearly, the European Commission will make its views known in this regard and, as I said to Deputy Martin, I understand a meeting is taking place this morning.  We must have consideration of what is in the best interests of passengers, consumers and business people and what is the best value for the taxpayer.  Within the responsibility the Government has of 25% ownership of the company, we will give that proper consideration.I wish to be very clear in saying, once again, that we will not be pushed into a corner in terms of having to have a fire sale because €175 million is put on the value of the Government's 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus.  Obviously, the regulatory authorities will give their view in respect of the competitive element of this.  While the director of Ryanair is a person who has made very important moves in the past in the sense of bringing real competition and access to and from this country for hundreds of millions of passengers, the fact is that the Government has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus and there are other players in the field.  The Government will consider the bid but, in respect of the disposal of any of our assets, very careful consideration will be given and a decision will only be made on the basis of what is in the best interests of the country and the people.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I wish to accentuate the dangers of an 80% dominance in a sector of this type.  There was a madcap proposal some ten years ago where Bank of Ireland wanted to merge with AIB, the consequences of which would have been catastrophic.  The principle applies equally to the airlines.  Thankfully that proposal went west, with, as I recall, the then Government's approval.  I hope the Government will see that this particular proposal goes under as well.The question does arise as to whether we are all dancing to the wrong tune this morning in discussing the Ryanair bid.  Has the Government considered whether it is an attempt by Michael O'Leary to sell his shares in Aer Lingus?  Is he setting a price of €1.30 because that will raise the value of the assets on his balance sheet?  The market seems to regard it as such this morning because the share price has only gone to €1.15.  If there is a 29% shareholding overhanging the market - that is what is really going on, in my view - will the Taoiseach consider refusing the bid and bringing forward the sale of the Government's holding to get a better price?  If there is a huge overhang of shares in the market, then the Government, in its own interests, should sell out before Ryanair does and not leave it until next year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The Government would be concerned about dominance of that scale in the market.  In respect of its ownership of the 25% share, the Government will not be forced into a situation where we must sell now and at a particular price.  We have not, collectively, as a Government, considered the bid that came in last night.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Has it been considered by individuals within Government?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Government will consider the definitive list of State assets to be disposed of and, in that regard, we are interested in getting the very best price for any of those assets, at the right time, in the appropriate way and in the best interests of the people and the country.  It is not a case of the Government reacting to the bid last night and saying we will now put our 25% share up for sale this week to see if we can get a better price.  The entire area must be considered in terms of its regulatory, competitive and economic value.  The Government will make its own decision in due course on the matter.I take Deputy Ross's point that there are other players and there may well be interest expressed by others in making offers.  I do not speak for Michael O'Leary or Ryanair.  Business sometimes operates in peculiar ways.

Many families are very concerned and angry about what has happened.  There were protests outside the House again yesterday in regard to the cut in the number of special needs assistants, the cut to the domiciliary care allowance and so forth.  The Minister said there will not be any further cuts in 2013 which will be the same as 2012 but that is after all the cuts have been made.  It is blatant spinning of the situation and it is unacceptable.Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Education and Training Boards Bill be brought before the House in order that we can debate and facilitate genuine interaction between the Minister and Members on what is happening to education for children with special needs generally, on the ongoing cutbacks and on the gap between official speak and the reality on the ground in regard to this issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Despite the economic circumstances, the Government has maintained special needs assistants and resource and learning support teachers for next year at the same level as this year.  The overall number of special needs assistants will remain unchanged at 10,575 and the number of learning support and resource teachers will remain unchanged at 9,950, including 5,500 resource teachers who support children with more complex special education needs.  The Bill, to which the Deputy referred, is due for publication this session.  There are some aspects of it which are quite complex.  I hope it will be published this session but I cannot confirm that as some of the issues are a little more complex than originally thought.  However, it is being prioritised and a great deal of work is being done on it and I hope it will get through before we rise for the summer recess.

Does he agree that given the urgency of the situation, this referendum should be held at the earliest opportunity in order to insert the protection of the rights of children in the Constitution?Will the Taoiseach also tell us when the child and family support agency Bill will be published?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The child and family support agency Bill will be published later this year.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is doing a great deal of work in respect of the referendum on child protection.  I do not want to give a definitive date for it but suffice to say that I am anxious that all the agencies involved will be able to agree on a particular wording in order that we can publish the Bill.  I would like it to be ready before the end of this session but I cannot confirm that until those involved in this area finalise their work.  Suffice to say that the Minister is intensely involved in this and would like to see it happen as quickly as possible.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Is it the Government's intention to introduce a property tax Bill in 2012 and to move on from the household tax, which is an unjust imposition on people to bail out bankers etc.?  Is it the Government's policy that a property tax will be introduced which would require a new Bill, or primary legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	42	As the Deputy will be aware, there is a commitment in the memorandum of understanding to a property tax based on value for 2013.  To give effect to that, we would need to consider legislation after the budget and the finance Bill.  As the Deputy is aware, the budget is timed for December of this year.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I would like clarification on the time.  Does that mean such a Bill would not be introduced and enacted until the first months of 2013?  How would that relate to the implementation of such a measure?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The agreement with the troika and the commitment in the memorandum of understanding is to have this effective in 2013.  As I said yesterday to Deputies, the committee under Mr. Thornhill has reported to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who will reflect on the report and in due course bring his recommendations to Government.  Arising from that, consideration will be given by Government as to the best option.  Clearly, a timeline for the introduction of legislation would be considered by Government at that time.  If it is to be effective in 2013, one would have to legislate some time before then.

The review deals with deaths up to 2010 and will, undoubtedly, raise many serious issues concerning the child protection system.  It is important that we ensure time is set aside in the Dáil next week to debate the report, learn the lessons to be learned therefrom and ensure we act on it quickly.  I ask the Taoiseach to reassure us in this regard.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Whips will certainly consider this issue and the Government is anxious that the matter be debated, if not next week, whenever it is appropriate to do so.

Is it intended to bring it before the House this year?  The adoption (tracing and information) Bill was also promised for this year.  Have the heads of both Bills been discussed by the Cabinet and are the Bills prepared for introduction in the House?  What is the position on the sea fisheries and maritime jurisdiction (amendment) Bill which is to provide for penalty points for skippers found to have infringed the Common Fisheries Policy, an issue which is the subject of some contention?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The Deputy has a long list today.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Amendments Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, are to be discussed together.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 7, line 45, to delete "Stait" and substitute "Stáit".During Committee Stage last week I indicated I would bring forward on Report Stage amendments to the Irish language version of the treaty, as held by the European  Commission.  The amendments are necessary to ensure consistency of the Irish translation of the treaty with other language translations and to correct grammatical and typographical errors in the Irish version.  In the course of preparing the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 it emerged that some corrections were required to the Irish language version of the treaty, as held by the European Commission.  Before correcting the Irish version of the European Stability Mechanism treaty attached to the Bill, the Irish version of the treaty held by the European Commission had to be amended.  The method of correction is known asprocès-verbal of rectification, PV.  The PV procedure is a simplified process of rectification of the text of the treaties where an error being corrected does not involve a substantive change to the treaties and the contracting states are agreed that there is an error that can be corrected as proposed.  It is not a procedure for amending the treaty.  In the case of the EU treaties, the procès-verbal  is conducted by way of written procedures, where the ratification is made once member states indicate they have no issue with the proposed amendment.  This procedure has been completed and the Irish version of the ESM treaty has been corrected.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, will carry through these corrections into the Irish version of the treaty set out in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Bill.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I repeat my outright opposition to the Bill which I opposed on the earlier Stages.  It is clear that it represents a continuation of the general policy of the European Union and the European Central Bank to offload the consequences of the crisis within the European financial markets onto the shoulders of working and poor people throughout the Union.  That policy which has been most notably implemented up to now in what are referred to as the peripheral states, including Greece, Portugal and Ireland, has had disastrous consequences for the economies of these countries, the living standards of the peoples concerned, public services and many other aspects of life.It is fundamentally unjust that a crisis of the financial system, which means a crisis brought about by the activities, speculation and workings of the major financial institutions, including hedge fund operators and speculators of various kinds, should result in a huge bill being presented to ordinary people throughout Europe.  I refer to circumstances in which the financial system goes awry, as happened spectacularly in the past four or five years.  The Bill, which is extraordinary, is continuing that policy.  That the agency being set up is not subject to any judicial or real democratic check is absolutely incredible.  While we do need a solidarity fund within Europe, the fund proposed is not a solidarity fund but involves a continuation of the predatory practices of the financial market system.According to recent articles inThe Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, there is €2 trillion in uninvested profits sitting in the bank accounts of major corporations and private companies in the eurozone.  There is a need for an emergency tax on these profits which have been made through the labours of ordinary people.  That they have not been invested, at a time when there are 17 million or 18 million unemployed in the eurozone, is social criminality.  We need an emergency tax on speculation in the financial markets throughout Europe and in that way to set up a genuine solidarity fund to be used for investment in society to create the millions of jobs needed to develop services and society to ensure the well-being of the majority, rather than continuing to cater for the private profits of speculators in the markets.  This is a disastrous system which shows all of what is wrong with capitalism and how its financial policies are implemented.  We need a clear alternative.  Therefore, I oppose the Bill.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Tá mise, fosta, ag cur in éadan an Bhille.  Mar adúirt mé ar Chéim an Choiste, aontaíonn Sinn Féin gur chóir go mbeadh ionad i gcroílár na hEorpa inar féidir airgead práinneach a thabhairt do thíortha atá taobh amuigh des na margaidh idirnáisiúnta.  Ach ní seo an t-ionad atá de dhíth.Tá lochtanna iontach móra sa Bhille.  Go háirithe, tá an t-airgead ag teacht ó thíortha a bhfuil cuid acu ag fáil airgid ón IMF agus ón ESFS iad féin, agus caithfidh na tíortha sin, Éire ina measc, airgead a chur isteach sa chiste seo sa dóigh is go mbeifear in ann airgead a thabhairt do bhancanna ar fud na Spáinne agus, b'fhéidir, san Iodáil agus sa tír seo, agus a leithéid.  Ní bheidh buntáiste ar bith ag dul do ghnáth shaoránaigh ar fud na hÉireann agus ar fud na hEorpa.  Tá an Bille iontach lochtach.Léiríonn an Bille an locht agus an laige atá ar cheannairí na hEorpa agus iad ag déileáil leis na fadhbanna móra eacnamaíochta atá sa tír seo.  Tá sé rí-shoiléir nach bhfuil seo ag dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna sin.  Má tá soiléireacht de dhíth orainn níl le déanamh ach féachaint ar an Spáinn, agus ar an mhaoiniú de €100 billiún, atá sí ag dul a fháil ón chiste seo fá choinne bancanna móra na Spáinne.  Feicimid an léadhbh atá ag na margaidh idirnáisiúnta ar an phróiseas.  Is é sin, tá an ráta úis a bhfuil na margaidh idirnáisiúnta ag gearradh ar an Spáinn níos áirde ná mar is gá.  Beidh an ráta céanna a ghearradh ar an Iodáil.Ní bheidh an ciste seo mór go leor le dul i ngleic leis an fadhbanna sin.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil dearcadh Shinn Féin air seo iontach soiléir.  Is muide an chéad pháirtí, cé go bhfuil páirtithe eile anois den bharúil chéanna, adúirt go gcaithfidh go mbeidh an ECB ar an eagraíocht a chuirfidh an t-airgead práinneach seo ar fáil dos na tíortha agus dos na bancanna ar fud na hEorpa.  Caithfidh sin a tharla sin nuair a bhéas an pian roinnte amach.I object to the passing of this legislation.  It is crystal clear that it will not deal with the problems of Europe.  It is wrong that Irish citizens should be asked to contribute to this fund to bail out banks in Spain and Ireland and, potentially, in other European countries such as Italy.  Since it was conceived at European level, it is clear that the fund is neither big enough nor structured appropriately to deal with the problems being experienced here.  If we need a crystal clear example, we need only look at what is happening in Spain where an injection of €100 billion in Spanish banks has not stemmed the tide of contagion, rather it has made it more difficult for the Spanish Government to borrow on international markets and the spillover will creep into Italy.Sinn Féin has been consistent.  The Minister has missed an opportunity.  He should have used this as a bargaining tool to have the ECB as the lender of last resort.  The ECB, not citizens of this or other European states, should be funding this vehicle and banks should only be funded when bondholders take a hit.  The Minister stated yesterday in committee that he would like to see bondholders taking a hit.  Therefore, this was an opportunity to join other countries, including Spain, which wanted to see a separation of sovereign and banking debt.  It is neither right nor appropriate for the Minister to ask taxpayers to allow bondholders in Spain, like those in Ireland, to be paid in full, including some who bought bonds at a reduced rate of 40% or 50%-----

Effectively, the private debts of bankers and bondholders are being placed on the backs of ordinary people, while very wealthy individuals are paying little or no tax; they certainly are not paying their fair share.  There is little or no accountability or transparency in the European Stability Mechanism.  It is wrong that there should be no legal, political or public accountability.  On that basis, I am opposed to the Bill.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The bottom line is that before us is legislation which enables ratification by the State of the treaty.  It is one we cannot change on our own and we must make a decision based on the merits of what is before us.  I reiterate my party's support for the Bill.  The lending capacity of the ESM will in time be proved to be inadequate and the issue will have to be revisited, but we must make a decision based on the content of the treaty, as it stands.  The European response to the banking crisis has been a spectacular failure and the sooner the issue of the link between sovereign and bank debt is revisited on a European-wide basis the better.  It is inevitable that this will happen, it is only a matter of time.  It is a pity the lessons are being learned slowly.  My party advocates a much more open process in that regard.  However, it supports the Bill.  I wish the Minister well in his meeting with the euro group tomorrow and ECOFIN on Friday.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	102	We had a constructive debate on the importance of the European Stability Mechanism Bill as it passed through Second, Committee and Report Stages.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Deputies who contributed to the debate, as well as the officials involved in the passage of the Bill through the House.Ireland's ratification of the ESM treaty is important, not only to facilitate, in the public interest, the financial stability of the European Union by establishing the ESM but also to ensure in the future that Ireland will have access to a credible funding backdrop, should it ever be needed.  This is important in terms of Ireland's re-entry to the markets and leaving the EU-IMF programme of support.I have stated on numerous occasions that this is a time for unity among euro area countries to ensure fiscal stability.  I reiterate that Ireland must play its part and stand in solidarity with its fellow euro area members both in the interests of this country and the interests of stability in the euro area.  Therefore, I urge Deputies to support the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 which I commend to the House.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 8, to delete lines 13 to 19 and substitute the following:"6.—A credit guarantee scheme shall be debated by both Houses of the Oireachtas prior to sanction by the Minister.".We are basically dealing with an enabling Bill which provides that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, introduce a scheme whereby the system will operate.  When the scheme is ready, there is provision in the Bill so that it will be published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I presume that will be in the Library.  If a motion annulling the scheme is not introduced within 21 days, the scheme takes effect.The scheme is the very basis of how the system will operate.  This is a very important scheme.  It enables businesses that are starved of credit to access credit and to help get the economy going.  We have a situation in this country where the banks have been literally stuffed with capital - the Minister for Finance admitted this - not because they are venerable institutions or because we want to preserve them for their own sake, but to enable them to lend into the business community so we can get growth and employment going again in Ireland.  The banks have not adhered to their side of the bargain.  By and large, lending from the established banking system to small businesses has been abysmal.  The Minister of State need not take my word for that.  As recently as three days ago, the CEO of the Credit Review Office essentially confirmed that.The scheme, which this Bill enables the Minister to introduce, is all important.  It will contain all the fundamental details that people are asking us about in our clinics, such as the kind of businesses that will be covered and the position on personal guarantees.  If lending is 75% guaranteed by the State, will the lender still be entitled to ask for a personal guarantee?  What about the situation concerning the private residence of the person from whom that personal guarantee is extracted?  These are pretty fundamental details which should be debated by both Houses or at a minimum, be debated in the separate committee on enterprise.  I am sure this will be done, but it would provide a good signal if it was written into the legislation that it shall be done.  These are the questions people are asking.Even though it is only an enabling Bill, it has been a very long time in gestation.  This scheme has been promised on numerous occasions for the past 15 or 16 months.  I appreciate that at the time of the change of Government, insufficient work had been done in the Department.  Judging from the Department brief that was handed to me, some work had been done on looking at such a scheme, but the work was in its infancy.  I appreciate that it takes some time, but we are 15 months down the road and we only have the enabling Bill.  It only provides that the Minister may make the scheme.  There are only some general provisions in the Bill.I put down an amendment to ensure the scheme would be in place within 60 days of the passage of this Bill through both Houses.  It was deemed to be out of order because allegedly it was a charge on the Exchequer.  I have racked what is left of my brain to see how this could possibly be a charge on the Exchequer.  I know this is not the responsibility of the Minister as it is the responsibility of the Bills Office, so I hope they are listening.  The only way what is proposed could represent a charge on the Exchequer would be if the scheme were not to come into operation within 60 days of the passage of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Is the Government really saying to people who have been crying out for credit, who are hanging on by their fingertips and who have been promised this scheme for the past 15 months that it will not be in operation two months after the Bill has been passed by both Houses and signed by the President?  The latter will happen by the end of the current session.  Is the Government not giving a guarantee to the effect that the scheme will be in operation by September or October?  How much longer will we be obliged to wait?  What I have outlined is the only logic I can detect with regard to the position of the Bills Office.I am aware the Minister of State cannot accept amendment No. 1 because the Bills Office, in its wisdom, has deemed it to be out of order.  However, I ask him to provide a firm commitment to the House that the scheme will be in operation within 60 days of the passage of the legislation before us through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am not seeking to make a political point or to be politically confrontational.  I am seeking the commitment to which I refer in the interests of every small business owner and sole proprietor in the country.  These people are crying out for extra credit and this scheme means a great deal to them.  I am of the view that the scheme is overblown and that it will not have the desired impact.  The cap that is envisaged is too tight and the types of loans that will be allowed under the scheme are far too restrictive in nature.  To some degree it pales in comparison with the British scheme on which, in many respects, it is modelled.  The fact that it is modelled on the British scheme makes the delay in implementing it even more inexplicable.The least those in the credit-starved business community deserve is for the Minister of State to provide an assurance such as that to which I refer.  He must give a firm commitment that the scheme will be in place within 60 days of the passage of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If he does not want to accept amendment No. 2, I ask the Minister of State to provide another firm commitment that, at a very minimum, the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be given the opportunity to discuss the scheme in some detail before the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation finally signs off on it.  I am also seeking a commitment to the effect that the Minister of State and his senior colleague, Deputy Bruton, will be open to suggestions on how the scheme might be improved and that the committee will not be expected to discuss it in an academic way or to simply rubber-stamp it.  The committee should be given the right to have an input into how the scheme will work.  The scheme is vital and relates to saving businesses and creating jobs.  In that context, we all have contribution to make.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14441	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The scheme will not be debated.  Best practice is to lay schemes before the Oireachtas and not to engage in debates on individual schemes.  I cannot accept amendment No. 2, the purpose of which is to have the scheme debated.  On Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, clearly indicated he was unwilling to engage in a further full-blown, policy-based discussion on the temporary partial loan guarantee scheme when presenting it to the Oireachtas.  The time for policy-based discussions is during the presentation of Bills to the Oireachtas, not on the presentation of secondary legislation.  I understand Deputies were offered the opportunity to contact officials from the Department in the interests of discussing the draft scheme.  I am not sure whether, to date, any requests in this regard have been received.  To my knowledge, they have not but the matter is open to clarification.The operator of the scheme is currently running workshops with the banks.  The target date for going live with the scheme is August.  As soon as the Bill is enacted, we will be in a position to try to ensure we meet this target.Many of the arguments that have been put forward by Opposition spokespersons were also put forward in the previous debates on the Bill.  The Minister has been definitive in the context of replying to those arguments.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	108	It ill behoves the Minister of State to say the time for policy-based discussions is at an end.  The delay in respect of this legislation have been exclusively on the Government side.  To date, there has been a delay of 15 or 16 months.  All I am seeking is that we engage in a policy-based discussion, which might take no more than a couple of hours, before the scheme is finally signed off on.  Surely, holding such a discussion will not make any material difference in the context of when the scheme is going to come into operation.I wish to correct the Minister of State in respect of a few points.  I accept that Members were invited to contact departmental officials regarding any matters they would like to see contemplated by the scheme.  I already made a number of suggestions in respect of the scheme on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  I sent copies of those to the officials in the Department.  In addition, some of those officials were present for the debates on the Bill and heard what I had to say.  In such circumstances, I do not believe I should be obliged to go through the process of contacting them again.  It is not just a question of contacting the officials of the Department while a scheme is being prepared.  I am seeking that the House, as represented by the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, should be in a position to see the final version of what the Government is proposing, to discuss it and the merits and demerits of various proposals relating to it, and to have an input in respect of it.  Is that not what we do here all the time in any event?  If we take the Minister of State's logic to its ultimate conclusion, it would mean we would be invited to make submissions in advance of legislation being produced but that when the latter is finally introduced, we would not be in a position to make any further comment on it.The idea behind debate and discussion is that everyone has an input into the final product.  With respect, the Minister of State and his Department do not have a monopoly of wisdom.  I informed my party colleagues that I would not call a vote on this amendment.  I am seriously tempted to press it to a vote now but I will not do so.  I am flabbergasted by the Minister of State's comment to the effect that the scheme will not be debated.  If he does not want to accept the amendment, that is fine and I will not press the matter to a vote.  His boss, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, unequivocally informed us on Committee Stage - we can access the record in this regard - that the committee would have an opportunity to debate the scheme when it was produced.  Unless my memory has completely deserted me, that is precisely what the Minister stated.  I will check the record shortly to confirm that.  Is the Minister of State indicating there will not be any facility provided in order that the scheme might be discussed?  That is what I understood him to say.  I would like clarification on that matter.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14441	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	113	There is no precedent which would prevent the scheme, once it is up and running, being debated by the committee.  There is no lack of clarity on my part or that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in respect of that matter.  The Bill before the House is enabling legislation and the scheme is the subject of a procurement exercise.  There were actually two such exercises carried out in respect of the scheme, one for the design consultant and the other for the operator.  The Deputy is a former Cabinet Minister.  He would have had control over policy in the various Departments in which he served and he knows exactly how the game is played in respect of these issues.  He is also aware we are obliged to comply with the timelines relating to public procurement.It took time to draft the legislation and deal with the various technical details involved.  However, this was necessary to ensure we got it right.  The process is all but complete and we want to ensure we will be in a position to roll out the scheme in August.  If the committee wants to discuss the scheme thereafter, there is absolutely no issue in that regard.That is a given.  It is a fundamental democratic principle that the committee be given that opportunity.

Rud an-thábhachtach é.  In the last while I have been before the Minister and a number of others to discuss the Bill and the issue of credit as it affects small businesses.  If anything, I can be criticised for barracking the Minister and his colleagues on the need for speed in getting funding to businesses.  Every day five businesses go to the wall.  This is shocking for the individuals involved and their families who have invested so much time and effort in trying to grow businesses.  It also has an enormous effect on the domestic economy.  It is part of the reason jobs are being shed at such a rate.  It is, therefore, important that a response is made as soon as possible.  Sinn Féin will not try to slow this process in any way.This is happening because the banking system, the job of which is to fund small businesses and which has received €64 billion from the Government and its predecessor, is not, according to business sector organisations, fulfilling that responsibility.  The Irish Small and Medium Business Enterprises Association, ISME, states 50% of its members are not receiving the funding they are seeking.  The Bill is to target €150 million in a three year period.  That amounts to between 2% and 4% of the funds needed by the business community.  This is not sufficient to deal with the problem; therefore, the problems in the banks cannot be ignored.My party tabled a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  In an effort to make loans more accessible, we sought to reduce the 2% so-called administration charge being levied on them.  The businesses seeking loans will be under pressure and, therefore, less able to pay extra amounts over and above normal credit costs.  However, our amendments were ruled out of order, whether by the Bills Office or the Ceann Comhairle, because it was claimed they would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  We proposed that administrative costs be included, but that they should not amount to 2%.I agree with my colleague on the Opposition benches that it is important to include in the Bill elements that will make its provisions happen faster and put money in the tills of the businesses which need it.  Every day we prevaricate five businesses will go bust.  People will be lost to the State through emigration; jobs will be lost and there will be a further reduction of the domestic economy.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure this happens fast.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	115	All Opposition parties submitted amendments regarding the 2% charge.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, he accepted the spirit of these amendments and has made substantial modifications to the 2% charge which are very acceptable.I find it personally hurtful that the Minister of State has accused me of playing politics.  I am not.  I believe in anything that will improve the flow of credit to business.  I want the scheme to go through as quickly as  possible.  I could just as easily claim Members on the other side of the House were playing politics when they promised the scheme 37 or 38 times in the course of the last 15 months, but I will leave that matter to one side.The Minister of State made an interesting observation in his reply to me.  He said I, as a former Cabinet Minister, knew how the game was played.  I thought this was to be a new era.  I thought the old games and systems were to be consigned to oblivion, that we were entering a brave new world of openness and transparency and that we were going to do things differently.   Was that not the mantra?We can, of course, debate the issue after the event.  However, we should be given the opportunity to discuss the details.  The Minister is aware that relevant details about personal guarantees, types of schemes, upper and lower limits for loans and this, that and the other are not included in the Bill.  It is an enabling Bill and very general.  Before the meat of it comes into operation, people of all persuasions who are represented on the committee should discuss it.  They might come up with a couple of good ideas that would force the Minister to change his mind on a few issues, but if that is not to happen, so be it.The Bills Office, in its wisdom, has ruled my amendment about the 60 day deadline out of order on the basis that it would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  That does not prevent the Government from making the amendment.  It can impose whatever charge it wishes, real or imaginary, on the Exchequer.  The Minister of State said August was the target date.  I welcome that announcement as August is within 60 days of the present.  It is no harm to put a constraint on oneself occasionally.  The Government is entitled, with the full permission of the Bills Office, to write the 60 day limit into the Bill, if it wishes.  I will not press the amendment, as I welcome the announcement that August is the target date.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14441	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Without being disingenuous, I apologise to the Deputy if he found my remarks personally hurtful, although an element in my brain tells me his skin is thicker than he might let on.

I was speaking in a metaphorical sense.  We are moving to ensure we can put the scheme in place and expedite it as quickly as possible.The scheme must be targeted towards commercially viable businesses.  We are conscious that businesses have failed in the last while.  That is why we are anxious to get the scheme up and running before the fall of the year.  Business that are in trouble will not, necessarily, be supported by the scheme.  An application must be viable and accompanied by a business plan, with potential projections for the business.The figure of 2% had to be charged, in line with state aid requirements.  In tabling amendments opposition Deputies must have regard to this.  State aid rules must be adhered to.  We must be cognisant of this in order that when we communicate our respective party positions on the Bill, the public will be made aware that the 2% charge is not being imposed simply for the sake of levying a charge.  There is an onus on us to do this.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	119	That is not true.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation said on Committee Stage that a charge of 0.8% was necessary to ensure it was within the bounds of State funding.  There is no legal imperative on the Government to impose a charge of 2%.  State aid schemes administered by county enterprise boards and other bodies carry a charge of less than 1%.  The figure of 2% has been chosen by the Government, for whatever reason, and it is over and above the necessary administration cost.  During the debate on Committee Stage we were told the charge was to cover potential losses within the system, but we were not given the details of these potential losses.  The Minister undertook to return to the select committee with the loss element of the 2% charge, but he did not do so.  That 2% is, without evidence to the contrary, an arbitrary figure and one that is a cost on small businesses, which find it difficult to survive.  I understand that it is necessary for the Government to focus on viable businesses.  I will not argue with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  I agree that viable business plans are necessary in order to convince for this level of credit.  It would be wrong for any Member to expose the State in a scheme that would further its loss of funds.  However, the microbusiness element, which is a key sector in society, is not being dealt with in the legislation.  It is part of the pipeline of new businesses that come into the economy.  I presented the case to the Minister previously that the European Progress Microfinance Facility had produced €200 million as far back as March 2011, which was approximately the date on which he received his seal of office.  As of yet, apart from a small amount going into an organisation called First-Step Microfinance, there has not been significant drawdown by the State for the purposes of microfinance facilities.  As far back as last March, 11 other countries in Europe had drawn down funding, including Bulgaria, but this State has not.  I urge the Minister to focus on the microbusiness element of society that is without funding.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14441	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	120	It is important to answer the point.  A charge had to be made under State aid rules.  We all accept that premise.  That is fact.  The decision was for 0.8% upwards.  The Government chose 2% as the most appropriate rate because one must allow an appropriate figure to be able to cover losses contributed to by administrative and other costs.  One must factor that in.  We are dealing, essentially, with taxpayers' money and we must factor in a potential figure for those losses and 2% was deemed to be the most appropriate figure in that respect.I have just been handed a note on the progress fund.  We do intend to approach the European Investment Fund, EIF, re support for the microfinance fund.  That will be introduced in the Houses in the coming weeks.  There will be progress in that regard.  Perhaps we can communicate with the Deputy on that particular issue as well.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 9, line 14, after "time," to insert the following:"not later than 12 months from the commencement of the scheme,".Section 10 provides that the Minister may at any time conduct a review of the operation of the credit guarantee scheme.  What I propose is that the review should take place within 12 months.  That is not unreasonable and the timeframe is not too short.  As has been outlined, we are putting taxpayers' money at risk in order to generate more credit.  We are reaching out, as it were, to small businesses, some of which would not be able to borrow in the normal way, either because the banks do not understand the nature of the business or for whatever other reason.To return to the Committee Stage amendments that were deemed out of order, I tabled an amendment to the effect that overdrafts and various other types of loan should be included, not simply new borrowing.  That was ruled out of order as being a charge on the Exchequer.  I do not know how it could have been ruled out of order for that reason because there is a cap anyway and given that is the case how could the charge on the Exchequer increase if one varies the type of loans that can be granted?  However, we will leave that to one side.  I have a suspicion that the real reason this is not being allowed is because if one allows necessary financing such as overdrafts and invoice financing, which is allowed under other comparable schemes in the United Kingdom and Canada, within the level of the cap, there would be a surge of demand and we would literally be at our limit within a short time in the early part of the year in the first 12 month period of the operation of the scheme.  I suspect that is the reason the proposal was turned down.Regardless of the fact that the Government does not want to vary the type of loans that can be guaranteed, there could be a rush and we could find ourselves out of money or up to the limit in a short period.  It may become apparent at an early stage that the scheme in its present format is not working because there is and will be a considerable demand which is not being satisfied by the banks for other types of loans such as overdrafts and invoice guarantees – the various types of loans that are allowed under the United Kingdom scheme which is the nearest comparable scheme.  Because such loans are not included the scheme is not working in the way in which the Government and everyone would like it to work in the interests of the country.  I accept the Government will probably review the scheme after 12 months but that should be specified in the legislation.  The initial review at least would need to take place after the scheme has been in operation for 12 months.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The amendment mirrors one I tabled on Committee Stage and I agree with it wholeheartedly.  Given the speed at which things are happening within the economy and given the major needs that are becoming apparent on a monthly basis it is important and logical that a scheme is reviewed properly to ensure it can deal with the issues that arise.  There is no logical reason not to accept such an amendment.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14441	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I understand the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already given a commitment that there would be a review of the scheme after a year of operation.  It would be right and proper that a review would take place.  As a matter of course one would have to review the scheme and I believe the Minister's commitment is sufficient.One could argue that there may not be sufficient data, patterns or trends emerging on the type of lending that arises from the scheme before a 12 month period has elapsed.  That is the justification for the Government's decision in that respect.  However, the commitment has been definitively given by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in that respect.  The review will be broad and comprehensive and will not be restrictive as per the amendment suggested.  The policy commitment is to conduct a review and to lay it before both Houses.  The matter is adequately dealt with in section 10.Invoice financing will be eligible for the scheme.  We will monitor closely the performance and we will consider if other types of credit should be included, as per Deputy O'Dea's point.  We will make changes if we deem it necessary following the review.  We are trying to ensure that we get the scheme off the ground, put a review mechanism in place after 12 months based on qualitative criteria and then if modifications or adjustments need to be made there is an open mind in government on the matter.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	124	There is no danger that sufficient trends will not emerge within the first 12 months to enable the Government to review the situation.  Although I accept what the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, stated on Committee Stage, if that is the Government's intention, why not include it in the legislation?  If the amendment is badly worded in the sense that it would force the Government to conduct the review within 12 months, perhaps it could be phrased more eloquently to the effect that a review would be conducted after the scheme had been operating for 12 months.  It is unfortunate that ministerial assurances, although given in good faith, do not always translate into reality, regardless of who is in office I hasten to add.  For this reason, I sought to include the provision proposed.  I have heard the Minister's commitment which has been reiterated by the Minister of State to which we will hold the Government when the scheme has been in operation for at least 12 months.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14441	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I acknowledge the Deputy's point which has been made in good faith.  A scheme of this nature will be vital in providing the credit necessary to fund businesses which are the backbone of the economy.  In this light, it would be ridiculous not to review the scheme after a certain time.  It is important that it be reviewed.

I request that the order of these two definitions be changed in order that the definition of "participating borrower" is placed before the definition of "participating lender" in keeping with the alphabetical layout of the definitions on page 4.

#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The Bill which was initiated by Senator Feargal Quinn does a great service in restoring a sense of morality and fair play to the building sector by providing for the eradication of a culture that spawned and was allowed to develop in the construction industry during the boom years, with catastrophic results for the sector, the purveyors of contracts, those employed in the industry, those supplying goods and services to it, their dependants and even extended families.  This allowed a perverse culture to prevail, whereby a Department would enter into a contract, normally with a large construction firm, to undertake a substantial Government development project.  The construction firm would co-ordinate the skills and services of a number of smaller companies to meet its contractual liabilities.  This would be achieved through subcontracts, oral or written, often of a loose nature.  Those involved participated in the knowledge that the contract was Government-backed and that payment would not be in doubt as long as the service was provided to the satisfaction of the Government employed architects overseeing the project.  The project would be finalised, the works certified and the construction firm paid.  In many cases, however, the firm walked off with the money, leaving those who had actually borne the cost of undertaking the project unpaid.This travesty of justice was allowed to continue for far too long and Senator Feargal Quinn does everyone in the subcontracting sector a great service by raising this issue in the Oireachtas and seeking to have it addressed.  Large contracting firms, many of which are household names, established separate companies for each project such that, although those delivering the service believed they were working for a reputable firm on a Government contract, they were actually working for a firm which had minimal share capital and been established to provide the parent company with an instrument to achieve payment and evade paying legitimate construction costs, while insulating it from liabilities arising from its reprehensible behaviour.This occurred all over Ireland, but it had devastating consequences for many in my constituency where its proximity to the capital, coupled with the availability of employment, resulted in many experienced tradesmen establishing subcontracting companies to meet the needs arising in the construction boom.  Thousands of young people could be seen in work vans travelling to Dublin each day and playing their part in enriching the State's coffers.  This was co-ordinated and facilitated by the subcontractors who became experts in building, as well as recruiting, logistics, procurement, etc.  They have been the engine driving an industry that in 2006 accounted for 25% of GNP.  Even when the country was in deep recession in 2010, it accounted for 9% of GNP.  It is a substantial part of the economy, yet the rot has been allowed to set in and it is endangering the industry's fundamental welfare.This legislation, while better late than never, ought to have been introduced years ago when it would have protected the many decent, hard-working subcontractors who did not get to enjoy the high profit margins during the boom, but who were forced to absorb the cost of the collapse of building firm after building firm, with no recourse.  I have met many such individuals in the past year.  They have certified proof of the outstanding debts owed to them by building firms which have been paid in full for work exclusively carried out and funded in total by the people mentioned.  The firms pocketed the payment cheques and refused to hand over even a small fraction of the amounts due.  In many cases, they were Government contracts.  In a few, withheld payments remained in the Government's possession, yet they could not be accessed on behalf of the people concerned.I have witnessed the decimation of small building enterprises and the heavy toll it has taken on families.  I have also witnessed the hurt and broken lives left in the wake of this phenomenon.  This Bill will inject a sense of morality into the construction sector.  More so, prompt payment and inexpensive and speedy dispute resolution facilities will lead to the creation of an environment within this sector that will provide the confidence and security essential to nurture the delicate shoots of recovery.  The introduction of a regular payments system will bring to an end the opportunity for one person or company to reap the rewards of another's labours.It will take time but I have no doubt the building sector will recover.  The measures we put in place in this legislation will ensure that when it does, it will present as a healthier and more socially conscious model capable of delivering our construction needs without wreaking the mayhem which I have witnessed being visited on the decent subcontractors of my constituency.  I never again want a system capable of visiting such destruction on hard-working people to be any part of our public building procurement model.

The Minister is correct that it is absolutely important we protect small building subcontractors who have been denied payment from larger companies.  The basic tenet of this Bill is that we must protect the small person.  As the Minister knows from his work with the Office of Public Works and through his constituency work, many of the people in question - subcontractors - are struggling, their income is decimated and, as they are self-employed, they do not have the option to go to social welfare.  In many cases, they are beaten for work because the tendering process is not fair or transparent.  They also have problems with bank lending.It is important we protect the people at the very heart of the construction sector - the small building subcontractor.  It is also important this Bill is progressed and we get a positive outcome.  I commend the Minister and Senator Quinn on the work they have done on it.  Over recent weeks I have met many subcontractors and their representatives in Cork through Mick O'Brien.  They have impressed upon me the urgency of this legislation to assist them in ensuring they are paid.  This Bill goes a long way towards that.As Deputy Conlan said, many subcontractors have been treated shamefully and reprehensibly.  This has an effect on their personal morale and esteem, as well as their family life.  It also affects the economy because many provided employment, but because they were not paid properly, they have had to lay workers off, which in turn means less of a contribution to the Exchequer.  This legislation is a new start.  The Government is committed to introducing new legislation to protect our small building contractors.  If the Minister does nothing else in his term of office, this legislation will ensure he left a positive legacy to the construction industry and ensured the small subcontractor cannot be denied payment.  This is an important Bill which must be progressed quickly.  This is a great step forward for ordinary subcontractors who are the lifeblood of our economy.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  It has been a joint effort with Senator Quinn who brought it through the Seanad.  It is an important part of the programme for Government and I welcome the work done on it.  As Deputy Buttimer said, there is an urgency in getting this legislation through the House in order that the net benefit can be seen by those who work in this sector.  One hopes it will be a measure that will stop the negative domino effect of consecutive non-payment between businesses by bringing in strict regulations.Steady progress has been made to date by the Government in introducing regulations and guidelines that help businesses.  This measure will help the construction industry.  Attracting foreign direct investment and reform of the public sector are progressing favourably.  The indigenous small and medium-sized enterprise sector requires ongoing work, as does the banking sector.  The construction sector will benefit from this Bill's measures.  More work can be done in reforming the planning sector to allow those with ready construction projects to be brought to contract stage.  The length of time An Bord Pleanála can take on granting planning permission needs to be amended.  A reduction in development levies at local authority level is also vital.The issue of eurobonds has been much in the news recently.  While it may be down the line a bit, progress should be made in this area.  We must watch for Structural Funds from Europe for shovel-ready structural projects which will benefit the construction sector which has such a high level of employment.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I support this Bill but I believe its provisions should not be confined to the construction sector.  If one talks to anyone in business, they will say their recurring problem is how difficult it is to get paid.  There is a culture around that which makes it a problem in keeping businesses viable.  There are elements of this Bill which need to be amended such as the thresholds.  However, there are also other ways of doing things in the construction sector.When I was elected to Kildare County Council in the 1990s, I spent most of my time picking up the pieces after the crash of the 1980s.  We need to do things differently if we are to avoid repeating the same problems.  Systems need to be put in place to reward good behaviour.  There are some good developers in the construction sector but there are some awful ones too.  We need to put systems in place that make it difficult for them to function.  In 1989 Australia adopted housing legislation which introduced a licensing system for building and development, a move I favour.  For example, there is a small contract for any work under AUS$5,000 and a full contract for any work over AUS$5,000.  The system ensures any construction company applying for a tender must show warranties.  If a construction company is pursued in the courts for non-payment, its licence could be withdrawn in addition to fines and penalties.  This system makes the consumer the king.Under the current system here, one has more consumer protection if one buys a table and chairs than if one buys a house.  We do not need to re-invent the wheel but look at best practice in other countries.  In Ireland all one needs is the money to start up a construction company.  We have seen the likes of Priory Hall where it is individuals or the public purse which has to deal with the aftermath.  We need to start learning lessons from that.  It would be well worthwhile if the Minister examined Australia's 1989 Home Building Act.  It provides a cooling-off period for the company offered a tender.  The contractor cannot subcontract work or function unless it has a licence.  I use New South Wales as an example but if a company is building in Germany, there must be several elements in place before it is permitted to build.There are a range of issues that could be considered.  The Australian model is not the only example but it is pitched under the department responsible for fair trade.  This matter is about fair trade and giving people who operate as they should be in business - or their competitors and partners - a fair chance.  The Australians have a complete department dealing with these issues in areas other than and including the construction sector.It has recently been brought to my attention by several people that there has been a re-emergence of directors who may have gone out of business.  This happened in the 1990s as well.  Such people return to business to trade, having made people redundant, in what is almost a seamless process.  I am concerned the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement does not have the capacity to keep up to speed with this, and the area should be examined if we are to reward good behaviour.  I do not believe we legislate for liquidators or those who can carry out that work, for example, and that should also be examined.  I do not know if one can get a friendly liquidator or if these people require a particular skill set.How we do business matters to the people we are talking about today who are down the food chain.  They do not have the wherewithal to end up in court getting the kind of judgments that big creditors can get.  There is more of a need for us to ensure such people are protected.  After all, they are almost exclusively indigenous small firms and they only have to be bitten once or twice before they go out of business.I am supportive of the legislation, although the limits are too high.  It makes sense to change the arrangements if somebody is affected by an issue more than once.  It makes sense to change such provisions as we want workable legislation.  This is not the only legislation required, especially with regard to the construction sector, and we must change how things are done.  Otherwise, the same group of people will re-emerge the whole time, and these are not necessarily the best people to have in the sector.  We must reward good behaviour, as there are good developers out there who pay their contractors.  One cannot label an entire sector in a negative way but there is a cohort within the construction sector who must be regulated.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As the Minister of State is aware, this Bill was initially introduced in the Seanad by Senator Feargal Quinn and the Government at that time gave every support to him.  We made the unusual decision - and a relatively unusual decision even in this Dáil - that the Government would support a Bill from an Independent Senator, giving help and access to the advice from the Attorney General, etc. in the development of the legislation.I regret we are talking about this Bill now because I had hoped it would have been passed earlier last year.  I understand there were many technical difficulties that had to be overcome and legal advice had to be sought.  It shows nevertheless that there are difficulties in our system when it takes this long for legislation to get through.  If there are issues that take a year to resolve while other parts of legislation can proceed quickly and have a significant impact, we are better to go ahead with the part that is ready.  We could come back a year later with the difficult issues and make amendments to the primary legislation if necessary.  That is in preference to holding up the entire process for a year while trying to get the issue absolutely right.We must consider what we are talking about.  To a certain extent in the context of this downturn, we are closing the stable door for many people after the horse has bolted.  We know how the construction industry works.  Even if we are talking about a State contract, the top contractor gets the payment.  This is the party with whom the contract is signed.  That contractor feeds down through a food chain of subcontractors and their subcontractors, etc.  The money, in many cases, was not getting to various subcontractors down along the line, with the result that people who had run perfectly good businesses and paid all their creditors found they were not being paid.  Such people would have been pushed out of business or survived with significant bad debts on their books.  When those in the middle found they were not being paid, those dependent on them in turn also found they were not being paid.  It is fair to say many went out of business not because of anything they did but because they had been trusting on payments.This Bill is a significant step in the right direction.  It is very important we protect the small operator at the end of the food chain.  I know there was pressure, when my party was part of the Government, to have higher limits, but €40,000 or €50,000 is a significant sum for small operators.  They must be protected from losing such amounts and it is an important provision in the Bill.There are very ambitious timescales for adjudication, with which I agree, but we must ensure they are adhered to.  There is a saying that justice delayed is justice denied, and I am a great believer in it.  In too many sectors we may be seeing inordinate delays while decisions should be made.  If we look across Departments and even at organisations like the Ombudsman, we can see this happening.  It is ironic that one of the roles of the Ombudsman is to deal with delays in the public service.  It is legitimate to make a complaint to the Ombudsman because the administration of a process is delayed.  Some of us could complain to the Ombudsman about the delay in the Ombudsman's office in making decisions recently.  It seems that queue is getting longer, and I hope that phenomenon will not be repeated in this legislation.Mention was made of An Bord Pleanála and the four month statutory objective in making decisions.  There has been more of a breach than observance of that provision.  I understand that if somebody is building a major piece of infrastructure, with much technical information, more than four months might be required for a decision.  If an appeal relates to a single house, which should be fairly simple to resolve one way or the other, why does the process go over four months?  I have seen that happen time and again.  When in government I made a suggestion to some colleagues, which may not have been taken up but which I will make again.  Perhaps this Minister of State will take it on board.  We should amend the Act relating to An Bord Pleanála in order that all decisions would have to be taken within four months unless a specific time extension was given by the Minister.  The Minister would have no say in the planning decision but he would have a say in permitting the extension of time, for which there must be a justification.  If there was a complex development with a lot of EIS material, the Minister could give the extension but if An Bord Pleanála came back after four months seeking an extension for consideration of a simple one off house, the Minister could instruct it to make a decision.I am convinced that if that was introduced, like in all deadlines situations, the number of extensions being sought from the Minister would be minimal because it would mean work for An Bord Pleanála and 90% of ordinary planning appeals would be decided within four months.  Local authorities do it within eight weeks and, in most cases, they do a fine job in making planning decisions.  I would argue their planning decisions are no more flawed in terms of county plans than those of An Bord Pleanála.  I ask the Minister to consider this because this Government should look at every timeframe for decision making within our system.  For so many people, no matter if it is an application for a social welfare benefit or something to do with the courts, the systems are gummed down completely by delay.Construction has become a dirty word in Irish society.  At times we go from one extreme to the other, we go from an extreme where we see an industry as being the answer to all problems to a point where we think that everything the industry does is wrong.  We certainly had too much construction in this country, it was unsustainable, but at present we are at the other extreme.  I am a great believer in the mathematical statement that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction or, as I call it, "the bungee jump effect".  We were way too high in the beginning but when the line tautened, it went too low.  Eventually it will wind up somewhere in the middle.  The sector is important in terms of employment because the unemployment figures are to a great degree made up of people who worked in the services and construction sectors.  We must get construction back to the long-term sustainable level.  I looked recently at house building numbers.  For a long time we could build and needed 30,000 houses per year.  The figure at the top of the boom of 90,000 was way too much.  There are areas of the country, however, that will run short of houses in the near future.  It is important we create a sustainable construction industry as quickly as possible.It is important the industry is reformed and this is part of the reform process.  There will now be an implicit contract between every contractor and subcontractor and the subcontractors will have certain rights no matter if the contract is verbal or written.  There will be strict rules on when a contractor can withhold payment and he must give notice to ensure there can be no excuses for non-payment.There is great talk about a major investment package.  I hope it comes, I look forward to it.  I hope President Hollande manages to get this investment package but we must have a debate on how we would spend €3 billion tomorrow.  Would we spend it, as everyone says, on schools and hospitals, where there is a 100% State spend and once the money is spent there would be important social infrastructure but its effect in stimulating the economy would be limited?  If, however, we invest by leveraging other money, the money becomes self-sustaining.  A common phenomenon when I was a Minister was there would a list of investments but when they were added together, the Exchequer provided all the money.  I calculate that if the State offers a 35% to 40% grant for any investment, and if the rest comes from private sources, not the State matching the State, financing becomes sustainable within its own terms.  The 40% the State puts in will be returned in savings in social welfare, and in income from VAT, PRSI payments and income tax.  Having spent the money, it has all come back and can be spent again.  When it has been spent again and returned, it can be spent again.  When we look at capital investment we must decide what will be the mix.  Will it be 100% State spending?  If so, the money is gone.  Will we look at more constructive and innovative ways of investing money to ensure it does what it is meant to do - stimulate the economy to the maximum extent and create a return to the Exchequer.One thing is certain; we need to invest.  I have said again and again, and if one rubs a stone for long enough it becomes shiny, that an obvious area for investment is in the improvement of the thermal quality of our buildings.  The last shock we suffered was a banking shock and the next shock could easily come in the form of hikes in energy prices.  If we want to reduce our vulnerability to energy shocks, we must get ahead of the game and ensure all of our buildings have good thermal qualities.  We must try to reduce this huge import bill for gas, oil and hydrocarbons in general that costs us so much.  It is a huge drain on the economy and leaves us vulnerable to a sudden rise in the cost of hydrocarbons.  I am convinced we have only scratched the surface of BER and investment.  A 35% grant would be sufficient and should not be limited to the small cash amount the State is spending at present.  It would be enough to get people to do the necessary work on their houses while we could also look at public buildings and commercial properties.  The State would get 100% of its investment back through reductions in the numbers unemployed, lower social welfare payments and increased tax.This is an important element.  There are practices in the construction industry that had probably existed for a long time that must change dramatically.  It is important we see this as one small step in reforming the sector and that we look at the entire industry to find out how we can have a good, efficient and high quality construction industry.  It is something we need and a good employer that will deliver quality buildings.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past and get ourselves into a better space.We are often great at pointing out the mistakes, which is important.There is no point, however, in pointing out mistakes if one is not going to do anything about them and ensure they are not repeated.  There is a huge onus on the Government to continue with the reform started by the previous Government and Senator Quinn to deal with it.I refer to the retention of title issue.  Many suppliers of goods retain title in order that if they do not get paid, they still legally own the goods and can get them back. The cement industry has made strong representations in this regard.  When cement is laid in a foundation, one cannot get it back.  Whatever chance one might have of getting a window or door back or the tiles off a roof, there is no point in delivering the cement back to the manufacturer.

This will not favour a particular industry but will address a self-evident problem where if cement, tarmacadam and so on are delivered and not paid for, there is no getting it back.  It is important to examine this and come up with a solution.The one thing we do not want to see is that people who have genuinely provided goods in order that society can function and who run their businesses well become the innocent victims.  One cannot always expect payment prior to delivery.  When I ran a co-operative, we had 30 days, and in some cases 60 days if we were lucky, to pay bills.  However, one could not work on the basis of payment on delivery.  Credit is part of business but the problem with cement is that once it is delivered, it cannot be returned and there cannot be retention of title.  It is important, therefore, that people can give credit because if credit is taken out of business, much of the lifeblood of business will be taken.  We have to protect those who, in good faith, give credit because, currently, if anything goes wrong, it is almost impossible for them to get their money back.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I wish to share time with Deputies Marcella Corcoran Kennedy and John Paul Phelan.I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I compliment Senator Quinn on highlighting this issue in the construction industry and on getting the Bill to the House.  As has been said previously, we are to a certain extent closing the stable door after the horse has bolted but it is important to get this right for the future to ensure a similar scenario does not arise again.I have met several subcontractors who are experiencing difficulty because they have not been paid that to which they feel they are entitled.  They feel hurt, annoyed and angry that the system has let them down.  They were the principal skilled tradesmen in the industry such as block layers and tilers and those who do the ground work on building sites.  They have the skills that are essential to ensuring we have a construction industry.  They feel very much let down and they feel the system must be improved to ensure this does not happen again.  It has been suggested that a simple way around this issue is to subject main contractors, who tend to continuously win contracts for State jobs and other large jobs, to a stipulation whereby if they have not paid subcontractors in the past, it would be included in the pre-qualification documents for a tender in order that their behaviour would catch up with them.  They would be ruled of winning future contracts if they did not pay what they should have in the past.  I understand that may not be practicable but it should be examined for the future.  Subcontractors have skills and they must have security of payment.  They buy materials and pay their staff every week and this money goes back into the community.  Unfortunately, many of them are on the dole and are trying to find work.The Bill is a step in the right direction to ensure what happened in the past will not be repeated in the future.  It will ensure the most skilful in the industry will be protected in the future.  I compliment the Minister of State for bringing the legislation, which I very much support, to the House.

I also welcome the fact that the Bill was initiated and developed by Senator Quinn and it is similar to existing legislation in Great Britain.  It is about time clarity was brought to this issue.  Public representatives are well aware of the many subcontractors who were caught out for no reason other than they did their jobs well.  They were subcontracted work on private and public contracts by larger companies and found themselves abused by the bigger players.  Many young people starting out in careers such as plastering, carpentry and so on were employed to do two or three jobs by a large developer and found they were left high and dry.  Meanwhile he moved on to another group of young people trying to start out.  This abuse of young people in the industry was appalling and it is time this was  addressed.The construction industry is a vital part of the economy and, therefore, checks and balances must be put in place to protect smaller contractors.  Recently, I attended the opening of two secondary schools in County Offaly which were built via State contracts but the celebrations were marred because many subcontractors who worked on the projects had not been paid by the main contractor who was awarded the contracts.  He did not fulfil his obligations and deprived these fine businessmen of cash flow when they needed it.  It is appalling that they had to be driven to protest on an important day for students, teachers and their parents.  We all felt bad for the subcontractors who, in good faith, did the work but were, unfortunately, not paid for it.I welcome a number of the Bill's provisions, including the code of practice on adjudication.  This will be helpful in avoiding a lengthy legal process in disputes.  The proposal for interim payments will reduce the exposure of smaller companies and individuals because cash flow is vital to businesses.  I am concerned that contracts with value in excess of €200,000 will not come under the scope of the legislation.  I acknowledge it is the figure agreed by the Seanad but a number of small contractors in my constituency have raised this matter with me.  They exercised their right to outline their feelings on it and many of them would like the threshold reduced to €50,000 because one man and two man operations will not win large contracts and giving them the opportunity to avail of the protection provided via a lower threshold would be only fair.  I do not know how "pay-when-paid" clauses ever emerged, as they are most unfair.  The practices that were introduced when the industry was booming were appalling because the big players won out and smaller contractors were left exposed.  Many of them ensured their staff and suppliers were paid and they went without.I add my voice in support of the Bill.  References were made to the horse having already bolted and so on, but the proposal is nevertheless very welcome.  There was ample opportunity for something like it to be put in place at any time in the past 15 years, but it was not done.  I welcome the legislation as a means of helping to address that failure.

I do not recall whether I spoke in the other House on the occasion of its introduction by Senator Feargal Quinn some years ago.  I commend the Senator on his achievement in bringing it through the Upper House and to the Dáil.  Several speakers observed that there is an element of closing the stable door when the horse is gone.  However, it is never too late to do the right thing and it is proper that legislative provision is made to ensure persons who have legitimately carried out work are paid for it.A properly functioning construction sector is important in any economy.  At the same time, whatever action future governments take, we must ensure we never again find ourselves in a situation of over-reliance on one sector of the economy.  While seeking to avoid any recurrence of the construction bubble that featured in the latter years of the Celtic tiger, it is important for any normal economy to have an operational construction industry.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, includes within his remit the Office of Public Works, which is engaged in construction-related matters throughout the country. This legislation goes some way to ensuring a fairer and more sustainable industry into the future.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy mentioned a recent case in her constituency where the completion of a public project was marred by protests at the lack of payment for work completed to certain subcontractors.  I am entirely in agreement with Deputy Pat Deering's suggestion that we should ensure no future public contract is awarded to large contractors which have withheld payment in the past from subcontractors engaged to carry out specific works.  That is a reasonable proposal.I take this opportunity to highlight the difficulties experienced by many people who worked formerly in the construction sector in terms of accessing benefits and payments.  I am aware that the Minister for Social Protection is reviewing this issue.  Thousands of people in the sector are now unemployed, many of whom have left the country.  Many others, however, are not in a position to leave because of commitments in this country.  For the self-employed, access to any benefits is a minefield and provision in this regard is completely unsatisfactory.  I urge the Minister for Social Protection to introduce changes to make the system fairer for previously self-employed persons, in the construction sector and elsewhere, who subsequently find themselves out of work.There has been a huge increase in recent years in black market activity in construction.  We have all, for example, heard anecdotal evidence of people who continue to work as carpenters, tilers, blocklayers and so on but must compete for business against others who can afford to charge lower rates because they are simultaneously claiming benefits.  It is unacceptable that people who are legitimately striving to keep businesses afloat are being undercut in this way.  It is not, unfortunately, an issue that is easily addressed.  I had a long discussion last week with a constituent who formerly employed eight or ten carpenters and is now reduced to operating as a sole trader.  This individual is struggling to stay in business while competing against former employees of his who are undercutting his prices while continuing to draw welfare benefits.  People who are obeying the law and striving to meet their costs on a weekly basis are competing on a far from level playing field.  There is significant work for the Government to do in this area.The information provided by the library and research service highlights an area for possible amendment in the Bill by way of the introduction of a payment system based on bonds or trust accounts.  This is particularly relevant in the context of the significant number of unfinished housing estates throughout the country.  What we currently have is a highly unsatisfactory system where local authorities are drawing down bonds for the completion of necessary works on unfinished schemes, particularly in regard to safety issues.  The problem is not just that these estates are unsightly but that many of them present significant dangers to residents.  Our antiquated system means it takes far too long before work can be done to make these sites safe.  There have already been tragic accidents in several estates.  I could show the Minister of State schemes in my constituency where it is only a matter of time before disaster happens.  If the legislation is to include provision for bonds and trust account payments for  subcontractors, we must take on board the fact that the current system of bonds in respect of the construction of residential estates is unsatisfactory.  The whole area should be reviewed in its entirety with a view to securing a satisfactory result for the owners of properties in the hundreds of unfinished housing estates throughout the State.I support the provisions contained in the Bill for making the construction industry more viable into the future and fairer for those who are working in it.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I welcome the opportunity, at long last, to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  We are having a useful Second Stage debate in this House after the lengthy and comprehensive discussion in the Seanad.  I welcome Senator Feargal Quinn to the Chamber and thank him for his initiative in bringing forward the legislation under Private Members' business.  Without his work, we would not be having this discussion today.  I hope we will see further examples of Private Members' Bills making it through the Houses and being signed by the President.  What is most important, however, is that any legislation, once enacted, is implemented and monitored.  The function of this House is to pass law and regulations; it is not our function to oversee their implementation on a daily basis.  There is a major difference between passing legislation and ensuring its implementation.  Failures in this regard are part of the reason we are here today discussing problems in the construction sector, where, in many cases, agreements were put in place but were simply not adhered to.Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy mentioned that the opening of two schools in Offaly was marred by protests at the failure to make payments to certain subcontractors.  I suspect the same contractor was involved in two other schools in Portlaoise.  What got to me about the contract was that it was a State one.  It is an example of what is approved in the House and what happens on the ground.  I said publicly some time ago - it was in the local newspapers - and I will say it in the House now if I have not done so before, the contractor who got that major multi-million euro schools construction project, subcontracted part of the work and the subcontractor subcontracted work to others.  On several Thursday mornings, many workers came to work in their good clothes.  They had a cup of tea in the canteen and then the contractor bussed them all up north to collect social welfare and bussed them back to the site in the afternoon.  That was a fraud on the taxpayer.  It resulted in other people not being paid for work for which they should have been paid.  That may not be covered here but it should be part of this legislation.  I raised the issue with the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills at the time and the matter was investigated.I have other examples of that particular issue.  I also have an example of where people who were covered by registered employment agreements could not get work block laying on a site even though they knew some of the people on the site were claiming social welfare.  They called in the National Employment Rights Agency, the social welfare officers and the Revenue Commissioners to inspect what was happening on the site.  Needless to say, the Garda were called in to deal with them because they were causing a nuisance to the contractor, but that is life.  Those concerned continued to make improper payments but two years later, I understand there was a settlement between one of the subcontractors and the Department of Social Protection for having people on the site who should not have been on it.That led on to the question I asked about who was implementing the registered employment agreement because the subcontractors to the contractor were not doing so.  I was told by the Secretary General and Accounting Officer of the Department of Education and Skills that it was a matter for the architect because he or she certifies the work done.  I was at the opening of an activity funded partly by the HSE and the local enterprise board last weekend.  The architect complained to me that he was being asked to check payslips and pay rates and that was not his job.  He openly admitted he had no knowledge or expertise in that area.  Obviously, he must certify that the job is done in accordance with the registered employment agreement.  He said he was not being paid to do that.  That person does not have the ability to do that, so we must have a system in place in order that when the State pays the full registered employment agreement rate for a job, the people on the job get the rate.  If they do not get the rate, two things happen.  The person who is getting the reduced rate could be claiming social welfare as well, which is costing the taxpayer money, but more to the point, the underbidders could have a claim somewhere along the line, knowing that work was not carried out in accordance with the tendering process which specified the rate.At 9 o'clock on the morning of the opening of a motorway financed by the Exchequer, a quarry owner arrived on site with half a dozen lorries and refused to move until he got a cheque for €2 million because he had not been paid.  Further along on the same motorway, the N7 heading south, subcontractors threatened to dig up the motorway and take back some of the tar, or some of the bespoke products, because they had not been paid.  They ultimately got settlements but the cheques bounced.  The motorway is open but people have not been paid.  The country is littered with bad examples of what happened in the past.As somebody said, the harsh lessons are no good unless we put something in place.  We have missed the boat in terms of the last construction boom but some fine day, there will be further good construction.  There is still much work going on under the capital investment programme, whether in education, health, transport or other areas.  There will always be new contracts, so it is important we put something in place.It is two years since I visited the Department of Finance when the Bill was going through the Seanad but my main concerns are not all dealt with by the legislation.  People at local authority level gave out contracts even though they knew when they were quizzed that they were granting contracts to contractors who had not paid local suppliers, because they knew the contractors had done this on other jobs.  They said they had the bond and that the tender and every bit of paperwork was correct.  They knew in their hearts there would be grief but they had no option other than to give the contract because the price was right.  Some of that arose because contractors put in what I would call contract prices less than the legitimate cost of the project.  I know there is scope for contracting authorities to say they do not believe a contractor's price is right but if the contractor keeps it a little under and not too far out, they may hope to get the difference back on the extras.  Perhaps they do not and are looking for cashflow to keep the business in operation.  As was said to me, contractors and subcontractors should provide references and the previous payment history should be taken into account.Another mechanism is causing problems for some people.  Those in the construction industry have told me that some contractors front-load.  When they price a contract, there is much labour and materials involved so they front-load the labour content of the contract in the tendering process to increase the percentage of payment that will occur early in the project.  They put in a large labour element into the early part, so they get a good cashflow in the beginning.  I understand why people do that but it has a knock-on effect in that the person coming in at the end of the project will be squeezed because the cashflow has got tight as the majority of the cashflow came early on in the process rather than later on.I thank the Minister of State for being involved in the regulatory impact statement.  I was pleased to have been invited to his Department last summer to participate in that and to give our input along with all of those involved in the industry.  The process was improved as a result of that.  I understand the Minister of State is considering some amendments.  The first amendment we will table, if it has not been tabled by the Minister of State, relates to the threshold.  There must be some threshold but €200,000 is ten times too high.  We will discuss that on Committee Stage.The Minister of State is considering the question of adjudication and whether it will be legally binding.  We need to tease out precisely how it will work on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State also mentioned the two week time limit.  A large contract will go on for 18 months.  So what if one subcontractor pulls out for two weeks.  He will have to crawl back on day 15.  That is no good and that subcontractor is probably in a worse position crawling back on to the site to resume the work.  That must be re-examined.  Matters of a financial nature do not always need to be dealt with and completed during the course of construction.  There are always issues at the end of contract to be sorted out.  I would not like to see health or education contracts being brought to a halt by people coming off site.  I would like to see a mechanism which would keep the project moving in the interest of the taxpayer.I thought the word "bespoke" referred to a suit.  I do not like that word.  We all know of the concerns of the people involved in quarry and concrete businesses.  I do not understand why they cannot be dealt with.  I know there is a problem with a definition with which we will have to deal.  Some of the key players have been involved with people from whom one cannot retrieve the product, so that must be dealt with.The question of bonds arises about which I was confused.  There is a performance bond for the main contractor to ensure he finishes the job.  There is a payment bond, which occurs in other countries and which may possibly be introduced.  The applicant who got planning for the project must lodge a bond with the local authority to ensure it is completed.  Deputy Phelan referred to the unfinished estates.  There are a plethora of bonds and some of them might not apply to the contractor where a public body has obtained the planning.  We are talking about contracts in the private sector as well.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I assume the Deputy is referring to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission's annual report for 2011 which was published last week.  Copies of the report have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and it is also available on the commission's website.  It was presented by the new ombudsman commission which took office in December 2011.  The office is anxious to build on the foundation work of its predecessors.  The report outlines details of the 2,275 complaints, containing 6,230 allegations, received from members of the public.  A total of 1,424 of these allegations were deemed to be inadmissible.  Of the allegations received, 39% related to abuse of authority, 26% to neglect of duty, 12% to discourtesy and 11% to non-fatal offences against the person.  These figures are in keeping with those of previous years and the new commission will, in its new strategy, attempt to address recurring issues.  The Garda Commissioner made 90 referrals during 2011.In 2011, 154 sanctions were applied by the Garda Commissioner following investigations by the ombudsman commission.  Eighteen files were submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to 19 Garda members.  The Director of Public Prosecutions directed prosecutions in eight of these cases relating to seven Garda members and two people who were not gardaí.  Also during 2011 there were convictions against six gardaí and one against a civilian following investigations by the ombudsman commission.The ombudsman commission is aware of the Garda Commissioner's commitment to continuous improvement and, in its new strategy, will try to examine the reasons for the recurrence of certain types of complaints.  I wholeheartedly welcome this approach.  It is important from a public service point of view that we continue to learn and improve the way we conduct ourselves.  Already the new ombudsman commission has submitted to me suggestions for legislative change aimed at enhancing the investigation and resolution of complaints.  I will carefully consider the case for this.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I thank the Minister for his reply and join him in thanking the former ombudsman.  I wish the new board every success.I am concerned about the high number of queries and complaints deemed inadmissible.  The Minister said twice that the new ombudsman commission was committed to considering issues that were recurring.  Are there specific trends or issues pertaining to the inadmissible complaints?  What resources are being used by the commission in assessing this issue?  The Minister stated the high level for 2011 was consistent with that in previous years.  Does the new ombudsman have a strategy to address this issue?  When will there be a reduction in the number of vexatious or inadmissible claims?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	148	To return to the statistics, the ombudsman commission received 2,275 complaints from members of the public in 2011 and they contained a total of 6,230 allegations of misconduct.  A total of 1,424 of these allegations were deemed to be inadmissible.  The corresponding figures for 2010 were 2,258 complaints, containing 4931 allegations, of which 1087 were deemed to be inadmissible.  The reasons for inadmissibility varied from complaints being outside the six month time limit or relating to the general control and direction of the Garda Síochána to being of such a minor nature as to be deemed by the ombudsman commission to be frivolous or vexatious.  Vexatious, in this context, should not necessarily be taken to mean mischievous or malign but that, in general, the allegations were so minor as not to warrant investigation.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Most of the complaints came from the north, south and south-central Dublin metropolitan regions, Cork city and Donegal.  Are there areas that are giving the ombudsman commission's office cause for concern?  Is the office directing resources at particular areas?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I am not aware of a particular area giving cause for concern.  The complaints are well spread around parts of the country.  Obviously, this is an issue the new members of the ombudsman commission may consider, but there was certainly nothing in the report laid before the Houses that indicated there was a substantial problem in a particular identifiable part of the country that would give rise to concern.  It is desirable that the number of complaints be reduced.  In particular, it is important that members of An Garda Síochána who have an extremely difficult job and operate frequently in difficult circumstances regarding certain individuals with whom they come into contact show appropriate courtesy in their interaction with the general public.  Some 11% of the complaints made related to discourtesy.  I hope this issue can be readily addressed.  It is important that, when ordinary members of the public are in contact with the Garda, they feel they have been dealt with courteously.One of the issues the new ombudsman commission is examining is whether there could be a different approach to what I describe as service level complaints, as opposed to complaints of alleged misconduct.  It is often the case that people who have made a telephone call do not believe they have received the immediate service they want.  In such cases, there is no issue of misconduct.  In the context of the communication I received, dated 31 May, and to which I want to give detailed consideration, the new ombudsman commission will examine the issue.  It could be to the benefit of both An Garda Síochána and the public.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	151	As I am sure the Deputy will be aware I, as Minister, have no role in the conduct of criminal investigations or in decisions on prosecutions.  These are matters for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, respectively, and it would be most inappropriate for me to attempt to become involved in assessing the content of any particular files.I can inform the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner has advised me that the Garda investigations in relation to Anglo Irish Bank are substantially complete.  A number of Garda investigation files have been submitted to the DPP and her independent directions are still awaited.  A full investigation team remains employed at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation to conduct necessary follow-up inquiries.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me this work is receiving absolute priority.  The latest information I have from the Garda authorities indicates that 23 members of An Garda Síochána were engaged in the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank, including nine members of An Garda Síochána currently seconded to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and 14 personnel at the Garda bureau of fraud investigation.I have previously stated in this House that I shared the impatience of many at the pace of the investigations into possible criminal behaviour at Anglo Irish Bank.  I also appreciate that the investigators and prosecutors face particular challenges as a result of the complexities of the matters being investigated.  This is the most complex investigation of its kind ever undertaken in the State.  I am advised there are ten strands to it.  It requires the analysis of a huge range of records - more than 800,000 separate documents and 250,000 recordings of telephone conversations.  Of the telephone recordings, 15,000 were identified as being relevant to the investigations.  A significant number of witness statements have been taken, and inevitably in a case like this, the statements can be extremely lengthy.  Search warrants and court orders have been executed and persons arrested.  It has also been necessary to carry out inquiries outside the State.In the context of the challenges arising in the investigation, shortly after assuming office I published the Criminal Justice Bill 2011 which was enacted in July last.  This Act provided new procedures to An Garda Síochána to facilitate its obtaining crucial information and documentation and accessing electronically held information of importance.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIt is now for the DPP to determine on the basis of the files and all additional information furnished to her whether a prosecution or prosecutions should be initiated.  This is a matter for the independent judgment of the DPP.  Like everyone else, I am anxious that clarity be brought to these crucial matters as soon as possible.  What is important now is that nothing be said which would in any way risk the possibility of prejudicing any criminal proceedings which might arise.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	153	This is merely the answer to Question No. 2.  There are other questions of a similar nature.  In fact, there is some additional information in my reply which, perhaps, I will have the opportunity to give to Deputy O'Brien in response to a supplementary.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I do not want to repeat this, but it would be useful if we could get the written answers.  Sometimes the Minister does not have enough time and is cut off and then we try to ask supplementary questions on half an answer.  The Oireachtas Service might take this into account and supply us with the written answers as well in order that we can ask informed supplementary questions.I am well aware of the Minister's remit and the constraints placed on him in terms of an ongoing criminal investigation but it is appropriate in this case that there is some update given, and I appreciate the fact that he has given that today.  I agree it is probably the most complex investigation undertaken by both the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda.  My information is that there was only one forensic accountant available to this investigation and perhaps the Minister could confirm that.Search warrants were issued as part of this investigation.  Can the Minister confirm whether any of those were issued under section 29, the one that was recently found to be unconstitutional?  If there are potential problems coming down the road as a result of evidence obtained under section 29, it is important we are aware of it, that it is recognised at least, and the Minister is taking steps to ensure these investigations do not collapse.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	155	On the latter issue, I have no information.  A substantial amount of the information was obtained as a consequence of the Criminal Justice Act being enacted in 2011 and a great deal of it would have no relevance to the section 29 issue that has given rise to difficulty.  In the context of the investigation, I do not know whether that issue arose.  If it did, I am sure it is an issue to which personnel in both the Garda and the DPP's office will direct their minds.  I have no information to suggest it is a problem or an issue, and I would not like it to give rise to any misunderstanding outside this House that it creates any particular difficulty in this investigation.It is now for the DPP to determine on the basis of the files and all additional information furnished to her whether a prosecution or prosecutions should be initiated.  This is a matter for the independent judgment of the DPP.  Like everyone else, I am anxious that clarity be brought to these crucial matters as soon as possible.  It is also important I do not say or do anything that could in any way prejudice any investigation into the matter.  I am conscious an enormous amount of work has been done in this area by the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  There is a considerable volume of information within the office of the DPP.I welcome that both Deputies O'Brien and Calleary have from time to time asked me about these matters.  It is important we have some sense, as best as I can provide, of where matters are going.  The DPP is entirely independent.  It is now for her judgment to determine, based on the enormous volume of evidence, documentation, information and, particularly, the files furnished to her, whether there are adequate grounds for the initiation of any or one or more prosecutions in respect of the different strands of investigations undertaken.  Like every other Member of the House, every member of the Government is anxious to know the position.  We would hope that prosecutions, should they be appropriate, would be initiated as soon as is possible.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	156	It is important that people know the investigation is, in the Minister's words, substantially complete, the files are with the DPP and it is a matter for her.  We look forward to the outcome of her deliberations on it.Perhaps the Minister could comment on the fact there was only one forensic accountant attached to the Garda investigation.  In the Minister's opinion, was this appropriate?  Was that one of the reasons, or part of the reason, the investigation took so long?  I would appreciate the Minister's comment on that.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	157	As Deputies, probably to the point of boredom, have heard me say to the House, on the first day I was in the Department of Justice and Equality following my appointment, I raised queries with regard to the investigations being conducted and whether there were additional resources required for the Garda or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I arranged that staff of my Department would meet the Garda Commissioner, the Director of the Office of Corporate Enforcement and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order that those issues would be discussed.  I raised that issue particularly directly with the Garda Commissioner.  At all times, I was informed that the Garda and the Office of the Director Corporate Enforcement had all the resources they needed.I specifically raised the issue of whether they needed anyone additional in the forensic accounting area or in any other area, and on all occasions I was assured they did not.  It was explained to me - it is not breaching confidence in any way - that it was not a question of needing a number of additional staff, but that one needed the same group of staff who had knowledge of the documentation through which they were going to engage consistently in the investigation with the prior knowledge they had.  It could not be segmented.  If one drafted in 100 staff, it would not have been of assistance given the way the investigation developed.  That is the way matters were explained to me.As I stated, the investigations are substantially complete.  The documentation, information and files are with the DPP.  It is always possible there would be some additional query on some aspect of matters, but as I understand it, what is now there is substantial and matters rest now with the DPP, exercising her discretion in accordance with law as to whether there is adequate information available to indicate that either a prosecution should be brought and is appropriate against one or more individuals, or that a prosecution cannot be brought and is not appropriate.  These are matters on which there is legislation laid down for the independent remit of the DPP and cannot be in any way influenced by me, as Minister, by the Government or, indeed, by Members of this House.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	159	While the latest recorded crime statistics show a decrease in most types of crime during 2011, as I have previously stated, I am concerned at the increase in certain categories of crime, notably burglaries and other property crimes.  In particular, I share the widespread outrage at recent incidents of aggravated burglary, where elderly people were terrorised in their own homes and subjected to barbaric brutality.  Although the overall incidence of crime is generally lower in rural than in urban areas, I am conscious of the deep distress these disturbing assaults can cause and the fear they give rise to in rural communities.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that An Garda Síochána has been relentless in its efforts to bring to justice those involved in this type of crime.I welcome that all crime trends are monitored closely by Garda management, with intelligence-led initiatives put in place to target burglary and other criminality in rural as well as all other areas.  The Deputy will be aware the Garda Commissioner has introduced a wide range of measures as part of a new operation aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.  These measures, which are showing welcome results, are encompassed in Operation Fiacla, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries throughout the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the courts.  Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda region in support of the operation.  This is a co-ordinated, intelligence-led strategy designed to maximise organisational resources to proactively target prolific offenders.In addition to the concerted law enforcement efforts which are being pursued by An Garda Síochána, crime prevention is a key component in tackling burglary and other property crime.  In this regard, the Garda national crime prevention unit and crime prevention officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary and property crime.  Similarly, the Garda national model of community policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  In this regard the Garda continues to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including through partnership programmes such as community alert and neighbourhood watch.I am full aware of the concerns that exist at the incidence of certain property crimes as well as the specific concerns felt in rural areas, and I welcome, therefore, the fact the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted and strategic approach to confront those engaging in this form of criminality.

I raised the issue of recent attacks on vulnerable people with the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, during the Topical Issue Debate.  Since these attacks, the level of concern in rural areas has increased significantly.  In the light of the cuts in the Department of Justice and Equality, including to the community alert and senior alert schemes, I raised with the Minister of State the possibility that he, wearing his Gaeltacht affairs hat, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, wearing his community affairs hat, and the Minister for Justice and Equality would discuss whether additional funding could be made available to support the community alert scheme and, in particular, the senior alert programme.  If Departments have underspent, they could release funding for the schemes in the coming weeks, thereby offering people a degree of security as we approach the winter months.Last month, in response to an oral question, the Minister provided an update on the number of investigations that had taken place under Operation Fiacla.  Will he provide a further update?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I do not have definitive figures, but I can provide some information for the Deputy.  Again, I must be careful not to say anything that could prejudice prosecutions.  Operation Fiacla has been particularly successful.  A number of individuals will find themselves before the courts in the not too distant future as a result of successful investigations.  Some of those who have been engaged in appalling thuggery will find themselves before the courts.  The Deputy will understand, therefore, if I do not say anything more on the matter.  I pay tribute again to the Garda for the work it has done in this area.I am conscious of the value of community alert schemes which have been funded through my Department.  Unfortunately, owing to the financial and economic legacy the Government has inherited, we must reduce the levels of public expenditure.  I have approximately €100 million less available in my Department in 2012 than I had in 2011.  However, we are doing our best to ensure community alert schemes are adequately funded.  Towards the end of last year we managed to find additional funding to meet needs.  We are operating with substantial efficiency in the Department.  An initial allocation of funding is being made to the community alert scheme this year and if the schemes require additional supports, I am hopeful we will be able to provide them towards the end of the year.

Will the Minister ascertain from his colleagues whether further funding is available for the scheme?The Law Reform Commission has issued a consultation paper on mandatory sentencing for certain crimes.

When does the Minister envisage he will be in a position to bring before the House proposals on mandatory sentencing for aggravated burglary?

In the context of the mandatory sentencing issue, clearly we have to wait for the final report.  I understand the Law Reform Commission has published a consultative document, but it has not yet published its final report.  If that is the case, we have to wait to see the contents of the final report.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the drafting of a metal theft crime prevention and reduction plan is at an advanced stage and that this work is proceeding in consultation with the stakeholders represented on the metal theft forum.  I understand the plan will be finalised shortly.  I look forward to the outcome of this process and will study any Garda recommendation concerning regulation, in conjunction with all stakeholders and relevant Departments.  Consideration of such recommendations will also need to have regard to the issues arising from the report on the cash for gold trade which was prepared by my Department and which I published yesterday.In addition, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is examining waste licensing and permitting legislation to ensure all necessary provisions, particularly those relating to traceability, are in place to avoid circumstances which could be exploited by criminals.  A draft set of regulations was circulated informally to relevant stakeholders earlier this year.  Following feedback from this process, the Minister will shortly consult on a second set of draft amending regulations to counter metal theft.An Garda Síochána is very much aware of the increase in the theft of metal and targeting such crime, as well as burglaries and theft related crimes generally, through a number of initiatives, including its work with the metal theft forum.  This Garda operational response is ongoing and taking place in parallel with the formal development of the plan.I share the Deputy's desire that the metal theft crime prevention and reduction plan be finalised in order that the overall response to this type of crime is as effective as possible.  I am confident the Garda is doing everything it can to progress this complex matter, in consultation with the other stakeholders, so as to ensure a properly considered and strategic response.

A report on the cash for gold business was published yesterday.  We are thinking around the problem of scrapping precious metals.  I welcome the publication of the metal forum report and the decision to submit it to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.   However, as the Minister knows better than anyone, action is needed.  It would be better for him to address this problem rather than consulting the archives to enable him to comment on speeches people may have made six or seven years ago before they entered the Oireachtas.  The theft of metals is a problem.  I introduced a Bill in March which the Minister rejected out of hand.

The report being sent to the committee will probably be followed by another.  While the Garda is doing its best and enjoys my support in this matter, it does not have the tools of the trade and is being led a merry dance because there is no traceability.  As a result, people can take what they like and plunder homes and protected buildings without anyone doing anything about it.The publication of the report yesterday means my question is out of date.  However, I am tired of reports and consultants and want action to be taken for the people I represent.  The Minister is more interested in referring to the city of Derry as Londonderry than he is in dealing with the problems people are facing.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	172	On the basis that the Deputy has a serious interest in these issues, I hope shortly to receive the forum report from the Garda which is anxious to ensure it is comprehensive.  I anticipated originally that I might have received it by this date.  As soon as I receive it, I will consider its contents.  I expect it will also be made available to Members.On the cash for gold issue, the Deputy knows the reason his Bill could not be accepted.  While I am sure it was a well intended measure, it failed to take cognisance of other relevant legislation and did not address the issue in the appropriate manner.  It would have given rise to a range of unnecessary side-effects, including unnecessary expense.I kept faith with the Deputies.  I told the House that we would publish a detailed report on the issue.  The report clearly raises a number of matters.  The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that all of the cash for gold outlets have been visited by the Garda Síochána.  In his view, there is no direct relationship between the opening of these outlets and any increase in burglaries.  Between 1999 and 2011, there has been a 2% increase in burglaries.  While one cannot ever condone the offence of burglary, given the context of the current economic climate, this is not a dramatic increase in burglaries.  There is no evidence to indicate a connectivity with cash for gold outlets.Another difficulty with the Deputy's report is that he would have provided for legislation which did not address the blindingly obvious, which was that the cash for gold industry is partly web based.  People see advertisements on the Internet and they send goods through the post.  This does not involve people entering retail outlets.  The report ignored entirely the reality that for decades, jewellery shops and antique shops have traded in second hand jewellery.  The Deputy's legislation did not address that issue.  As a result of the very detailed submission furnished to the joint Oireachtas committee, I hope that that committee, in conjunction with the enterprise committee which has some remit in this area, will consider that report and make proportionate and appropriate recommendations.Where there is lawful business being conducted, it is important that we do not introduce some extra layer of bureaucracy which results in legitimate businesses incurring unnecessary expense to no benefit to the general public, or to the investigative capacity of the Garda Síochána.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The Minister has his head in the sand.  My Bill has shortcomings in it and I would be the first to admit that.  It was sent in last November and it only reached the floor here in March, so there was plenty of time for him and his officials to look over it and advise me in whatever way possible.  The fact is that homes and precious buildings are being plundered.  The Minister had a taste of that when he was abroad, so he knows what it is like.  I do not wish that to happen to anybody, because it is a terrible intrusion on people's privacy.Going to committees, sending reports and listening to what the Garda Commissioner says is one thing, but I am meeting senior officers up and down the country who are saying something different.  They know the facts.  I would be the last person to call for more punitive legislation to affect small businesses, but we have to regularise the situation.  Jewellers are dealing with this for years, and rightly so, but they have a code of practice and I was not talking about them, nor was I referring to cash for gold solely.  I was talking about precious metals that have been taken from farms, historic buildings and everywhere else.  If somebody is telling me that burglaries have only increased by 2%, then the Minister must be living in Londonderry.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I thank the Deputy for his usual constructive and coherent contribution to the debate on a serious issue.  I look forward to receiving his report from the justice committee on the matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	175	Section 20 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality may determine the policing priorities for the Garda Síochána for the coming year in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  The Commissioner, in turn, must take account of the policing priorities identified and submit to me by the end of October a draft policing plan for the following year.  Section 22(1) of the Act provides that the policing plan prepared by the Commissioner shall set out the proposed arrangements for the policing of the State for the following year, including any proposal to establish or dissolve a national unit of the Garda Síochána; alter the boundaries of a regional geographical area under the control of an assistant Garda Commissioner or of a divisional geographical area under the control of a chief superintendent; establish or relocate a divisional headquarters under the control of a chief superintendent or of a district headquarters under the control of a superintendent; or open a Garda station in a new location or cease stationing members in an existing station.As Minister, I must approve the policing plan as submitted by the Commissioner, or with amendments determined in consultation with the Commissioner.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that I cannot comment on the contents of a policing plan for 2013 as it is not yet drafted.  Consultations relating to the drafting of the 2013 plan will start in the third quarter of this year.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I find the answer a little strange, because there have been many media reports on the potential contents of this plan.  In my own area, we have had media reports of a Garda district being closed down.  We have had reports in Donegal of meetings between senior officers and rank and file gardaí about the potential closure of another district, and the impact that will have.  I find it bizarre to hear the Minister say that consultation has not yet begun, yet we are hearing reports across the State of consultation being underway, with elements of it reported in the media.  This is causing concern.  There has been a media report in Cork that the Cobh district will be amalgamated with Mayfield and another district.  A number of rural Garda stations have already been shut down, and now we are hearing about Garda districts being shut down as well.If the consultation has not started, when will it start?  The Minister said that it will be reported back to him in October, but I find it strange that he says the consultation has not started, yet we are hearing and seeing media reports to the contrary.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The statutory consultation that takes place between myself, as Minister, and the Commissioner on a draft plan has not started.  I have absolutely no doubt that he is engaging in work with a view to developing a policing plan for 2013, and I do not think that matters simply stop and he does not direct his mind to this.  I am not privy to any internal consultative process he may be engaged in within the Garda Síochána.  I know he was engaged in a process in 2011 for the 2012 plan.I am responsible for a lot of things, but happily I am not responsible for media reports on anything.  That is just as well, based on the level of inaccuracy often seen in media reports.  I have already stated that my Department has €100 million less available to it.  Under the multi-annual budgeting position, we know we will have at least €60 million less in 2013 than we have in 2012.  The Garda Commissioner has an obligation, bearing in mind the financial condition of the State and the amount of funds available to be allocated to Garda matters, to look at how to use resources to the maximum efficiency, to maximise Garda capabilities, to modernise where appropriate, as well as to engage in some restructuring of the force if he believes that will produce a more efficient police service for the benefit of the general public.I am not privy to any of the rumours mentioned by the Deputy.  In the run-up to the announcements about Garda stations, I recall reading in the media somebody projecting - this became theology within two weeks - that there would be 200 Garda stations closed at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012.  That proved to be wildly inaccurate speculation in the media.  I expect the Commissioner is engaged in some internal discussions.  There may be different issues discussed with a view to assessing what steps might be taken, but I am not privy to any of that.  I suggest that the Deputy should not rely on media reports.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I probably rely less on media reports than anybody else in this House because I know how inaccurate they can be.  I understand the Minister's position on the Garda Commissioner's internal consultation in the sense that such a consultation will take place before the Commissioner consults with him.  How does that consultation work?  Is there any role for the JPCs in it?  Is there any consultation with local community groups, or does a complete internal consultation process take place in the first instance, after which the policing plan is drafted and brought to the Department?  I am aware that it is the Minister's responsibility to approve or reject the plan.  However, the Oireachtas committee should have an opportunity to consider it because the time has come to engage in a serious discussion on the type of policing we require in this State.  Such a debate might focus on whether restructuring should take place and on the nature of policing.  There has been a great deal of discussion about community policing.  We must consider exactly what is meant by the latter and how such policing is filtered down.  Will the Minister provide a commitment that prior to this making a decision - I understand the decision is his to make - that there will be at least some consultation with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the matter?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The statutory position is that the Garda Commissioner presents the draft report to the Minister and then they consult on it.  In the context of there being security matters relating to that issue, it is a decision for the Minister to make.  I do not intend to furnish a draft report from the Commissioner to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  It is open to the committee to discuss policing issues in a general way and to examine what it may consider to be appropriate reforms.  When it comes to addressing some of these issues, however, there is a tendency - my comments in this regard are not aimed at the Deputy - for some Members of the House and other individuals outside it to live in a financial fantasy world where there is an assumption that an unlimited amount of money is available and that nothing should ever change in the sphere of policing.  There are those who believe that because we had X number of Garda stations in 1922, we should still have the same number in 2012 and that we should have no regard for modern communication or transportation systems.A constructive engagement at committee level, where a committee would formulate views as to structures within the Garda Síochána, would not in any way be binding on the Commissioner or on me, as Minister.  However, such an engagement would of course contribute to the public debate on and consideration of the issue.  It is open to the members of JPCs to raise any local issues of concern and to constructively engage with members of the Garda at meetings of these committees.  The consultative process in which the Commissioner engages would principally involve those in supervisory, managerial and officer positions across the country.  Some of these individuals attend JPC meetings and can feed into the process.  As I understand it, this is a fully considered and comprehensive consultative process.  Ultimately, the statutory obligation rests with the Commissioner to furnish to me his policing plan for 2013 as he deems appropriate.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 19 together.While the latest recorded crime statistics show a decrease in most types of crime during 2011, I am of course concerned at the increase in certain categories of crime, notably burglaries and other property crimes.  In particular, I share the widespread outrage at recent incidents of aggravated burglary where elderly people were terrorised in their own homes.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	181	My colleague, Deputy Colreavy, also wishes to contribute and I presume he will focus on rural Garda stations.On Question No. 6, I wish to comment on the report on the cash-for-gold industry which has been published and which is due to be discussed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I welcome that report and I also welcome the opportunity to discuss it.  However, I do not accept the Garda Commissioner's opinion to the effect that there is no evidence to suggest a link between burglaries and the cash-for-gold industry.  All of the evidence furnished to me by people who come to my constituency office and at JPC meetings I have attended indicates that cash-for-gold outlets are being used to sell stolen goods.  If an analysis were carried out in respect of the location of these outlets and the number of burglaries which take place in surrounding areas, I would bet anything that a pattern would emerge.  I do not, therefore, accept the Garda Commissioner's assertion in respect of this matter.  I am of the view that there is actually evidence to the contrary.This is a matter on which we must focus.  I read a media report in which a number of comments were attributed to the Minister.  I hope I accurately reflect what he said when he asserted that members of the Garda had visited all 124 cash-for-gold outlets throughout the country and informed them of how to contact the force.  It is as if the Garda Síochána is some sort of invisible organisation which these people do not know how to contact.  It is very easy to contact the force.We must consider this issue and I am glad the committee is going to discuss it.  I would like regulations similar to those which obtain in respect of pawnbrokers to be introduced in respect of the cash-for-gold industry.  It is important that this should be done while we are awaiting the opportunity to discuss the report to which I refer.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Members of the force did more than inform the proprietors of or those who work in cash-for-gold outlets how to contact the Garda.  I suspect that was not a great mystery to most of them.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The media report in question stated that this is what the Minister said.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	184	One aspect of what the officers in question did was to clearly draw to the attention of individuals operating in that industry the existing laws relating to the receipt of stolen property and, in particular, the provisions of the 2001 Act.  It was very important that this was done.I cannot invent facts which, I am informed, do not currently exist.  As the Deputy will have seen from the report to which he refers, the Garda Commissioner was consulted on three different occasions.  He was consulted in respect of this issue by my predecessor shortly before the change of Government.  We then followed up with him on it in the aftermath of the election and then again very recently in order that when the report was published it would contain the most up-to-date view from him.  A direct connection of the nature to which the Deputy refers - namely, a substantial increase in the number of burglaries in areas where cash-for-gold outlets are located - has not been identified.We must be extremely careful when discussing this matter.  One of the reasons that there are so many of these outlets relates to the huge increase in the value of gold.  Sadly, another reason for their existence relates to the financial difficulties by which many families are being affected.  In that context, people are trading old family items in order to generate funding for themselves.  Cash-for-gold outlets are as much a consequence of the economic difficulties of the State, the number of people who are unemployed and the problems with which families have unexpectedly been faced as they are of anything else.  We must take care and ensure that, in this House or elsewhere, we do not criminalise people who are engaging in legitimate business activities.  For many years, jewellery shops have bought and sold second-hand jewellery and the antiques trade is solely based on the sale of second-hand items.  However, no one is attributing direct criminality to those who operate in these areas.In the context of the Deputy's suggestion that some cash-for-gold outlets may be located in burglary blackspots, I reiterate what I said earlier in response to Deputy Mattie McGrath, namely, that part of this business is web-based in nature and involves individuals submitting items by post to cash-for-gold outlets and receiving sums of money in return by way of value.  Part of the issue is consumer protection in dealing with these outlets.The issue is more complex than people are saying.  In the statistics we have, there is no indication of a huge statistical upsurge in burglary.  Any burglary is something that should not happen and I am not condoning it in any way.  There is not, however, a direct connectivity here.  We need to be careful as to how we deal with the matter.I am looking forward to the matter being given a further detailed examination in the joint committee.  If appropriate legislation needs to be developed, I assure the Deputy it will be.

I imagine one criterion is the population of a district.  This immediately mitigates against districts with lower populations.  I imagine distance between stations is a criterion.  The Minister said the current network was designed when the gardaí were on bicycles.  This is true, but so were the burglars on bicycles in those days.  A 100% record of crime prevention means zero crime.  If I were a crime prevention officer I would not like to achieve 100% effectiveness, because that figure would be used to close my station.In Sligo and Leitrim, a number of stations are being closed.  Most of them serve people who live in fairly isolated Border areas.  There is a big distance between the stations.  There was no public discussion or consultation and no effort was made to reassure the population that, with the change in policing practice and reduced number of stations, their safety would still be a priority.In order to reassure vulnerable people in isolated rural communities, can the Minister advise the House as to whether or not there will be changes in practice and what those changes will be?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	186	No additional stations will be closed this year beyond the 39 announced at the end of 2011, eight of which had already been closed and were not functioning.  A considerable number of others were open for two or three hours in the day.  The busiest stations that were closed were not rural stations.  They were the three Dublin stations in Dalkey, Harcourt Terrace and Whitehall.  The perception of the Commissioner was, I understand, that we had a substantial number of stations in Dublin and that for operational effectiveness and to use resources wisely the closure of those stations was appropriate in the context of the large number of stations in Dublin.  The closures have been a great deal greater - they were not all in isolated rural areas.In isolated rural areas, the greatest assistance the Garda can give is not to be sitting inside the walls of a station but to be out and about, available to be called in police cars and engaging in whatever investigations are required.  I would prefer to see gardaí engaged with the community rather than sitting behind a desk in a station.It is for the Commissioner to determine, based on operational effectiveness, the stations to keep open and the appropriate stations to close.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I fully support the Minister's plans for policing in Dublin.  However, it has come to my attention informally that with the closure of Harcourt Terrace there has been some difficulty in reallocating the gardaí stationed there to other parts of the city.  Donnybrook Garda station, for example, has had its hours restricted and has lost its community garda.  It is my understanding that if we could free up those resources we would be able, at least, to get the community garda back for Donnybrook.  Could the Minister look into this matter and discover whether or not this is the case?With the loss of resources in the city and elsewhere we will have to do much more work with JPCs.  I know the Minister has been paying close attention to what they are doing but to help them to play a more important role, particularly with the loss of community gardaí, we need to put more resources into them, if possible.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I merely wish to clarify a matter.  I do not suggest shops knowingly engage in criminal activity, but it is important to have regulation to protect, not only victims of burglaries but also the proprietors of the shops themselves.  We do not want shops to be used unknowingly to sell stolen goods.  Regulation is equally important for the owners of shops who want to carry out legitimate trade.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I am waiting for the report of the joint committee.  I think it anomalous that certain information is required to be retained by pawnbrokers but not by others who trade in what can best be described as second-hand goods.  The problem is that second-hand goods are traded at markets throughout the country and in a range of other locations.  We could attempt to address the issue bit by bit and create other anomalies.A particular issue, which I hope the committee will address, is that the business is often conducted in a web-based forum.  We could put in place a bit of legislation that would seem useful where people actually walk into a retail or cash-for-gold outlet but would be useless, either as a law enforcement or protective measure, because of the web-based nature of the business.  A great deal more work remains to be done on this issue than was done on the Private Members' Bill dealt with previously.I am sorry if my response to Deputy Murphy's query sounds like a mantra.  It is for the Garda Commissioner to determine where to allocate members arising out of the closure of Harcourt Street Garda station.  I am aware of the Garda stations in Dublin to which members are, or have been, allocated.  I cannot micromanage the community garda in Donnybrook.  If there is a gap in that area I am sure the Commissioner will have regard to that.  I am happy to follow up that matter for the Deputy with a simple query to the Commissioner and to revert to the Deputy with any information I obtain.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I have been informed by the Garda authorities that as of 31 May 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Garda Reserve was 918, with a further 225 in training.  The moratorium on public service recruitment does not apply to members of the Garda Reserve as they are volunteers and recruitment to the reserve is ongoing.The target strength of the Garda Reserve is 10% of the full-time force and I would like to assure the House that the Government is fully committed to its continued development.  Members of the Garda Reserve make a hugely valuable contribution to policing.  They are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and professions and currently include representatives of 27 different countries.The Garda Reserve has a wide range of duties which include foot patrols, road traffic checkpoint duties, community-neighbourhood policing and station duty, other than the care and custody of prisoners.  They assist in the policing of public events and also at the scenes of accidents, fires and major emergencies.The Garda Commissioner has carried out a review of the role and functions of the Garda Reserve and arising from that, is introducing new measures to enhance the operation of the reserve.  These include the extension of the functions of the Garda Reserve to the exercise of powers under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and section 41 of the Road Traffic Acts in relation to the seizure of vehicles.Training on these and other matters, such as dealing with domestic violence, child protection and conflict resolution, is being organised for serving and recruit members of the Garda Reserve and will commence later this year.  Garda Reserve members will also be issued with TETRA radios when going on duty.I would like to place on record my appreciation of the members of the reserve who give of their time on a voluntary basis and for their ongoing commitment to the Garda Síochána.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	191	We spent much of today's time talking about the difficulties posed by gaps in policing and in Garda strength.  With just over 1,000 people, between those actually in the reserve and those in training, we have a massive resource here that is not being used to its potential effect.  For instance, if we have people from 27 countries, they immediately give us an entry into 27 communities in terms of liaison and day-to-day Garda interaction.  Some of the more experienced members of the Garda Reserve could fulfil the role of community gardaí and engage with communities on crime prevention.  We spoke last month about the gaps occurring in terms of crime prevention officers around the country.  Surely some of the more experienced members of the Garda Reserve, for instance retired people who now have time, could be inserted into the role.  Youth diversion projects do fantastic work.  Again, there is an opportunity for members of the Garda Reserve to get involved in such an area which does not require them to get involved in exposing themselves to the implementation of law but to which they would bring their life experience.  Given the challenges facing the Commissioner on personnel and budgets we have a fantastic resource, potentially, which is not being sufficiently utilised.  I am pleased to hear the Commissioner is beginning to engage with the Minister on the matter.  It is time we put it up to the Commissioner that this asset must be utilised more, in particular for the kind of gaps about which we have just spoken.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The Garda Reserve is a tremendous resource.  I have had the privilege and pleasure of meeting and talking to some members of the Garda Reserve in the past 15 months as Minister.  They are enormously enthusiastic and have an extraordinary sense of public service.  I very much welcome the fact the Commissioner is looking at new and additional roles for the Garda Reserve to play.  He has identified appropriate roles.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  I would see the areas in which the Garda Reserve can properly engage continuing to expand in the coming years but it is of vital importance that appropriate training is provided before they engage in new duties.  It is a welcome development.The Deputy and other Members of the House might be interested to know that there are currently 60 non-Irish nationals in the Garda Reserve, including attested members and those in training.  The members come from the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus Cameroon, China, the Czech Republic, India, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Moldova, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine and Zimbabwe.  I am particularly pleased that non-Irish nationals are participating in the Garda Reserve.  I believe that they can play a significant role, as the Deputy mentioned, in developing links between the Garda and the non-national communities.  It is important that the Garda Reserve, the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces reflect the changing face of this country and that smaller communities who are settled in this country are properly represented.  I look forward to a time when we will be financially in a more sound space and able again to commence recruitment to the Garda.  I hope we will find that there will be representatives of minority communities who are settled in this country who are so recruited.  In the intervening period it is a welcome development that we have this multinational engagement in the Garda Reserve and I look forward to it being further extended as the number in the Garda Reserve continues to increase.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Could we challenge the Commissioner in order that in the policing plan for 2013 a specific part would be allocated to the targets he is setting for the Garda Reserve in order that they could be assessed?I wish to divert slightly from the 60 non-Irish nationals in the Garda Reserve to congratulate the Minister on the ongoing success of the citizenship ceremonies, to such an extent that they have moved to the Convention Centre.  Surely the ceremonies are a perfect opportunity to showcase the Garda Reserve.  The fact that one has representatives of those communities who are becoming citizens serving within the police force of the country would, first, show how seriously we take those people and, second, encourage more to join.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I can inform the Deputy that to my knowledge some individuals who are members of the Garda Reserve have been granted citizenship in recent citizenship ceremonies.  The Garda and the Defence Forces have been engaged in the ceremonies.  Their involvement centres on the Garda Band, which on occasion plays at the service.  When the Garda Band is not present at the service one of the Army bands participates instead.  They both bring an additional level of ceremonial to the event.  Because of the happy nature of the ceremonies we do not generally need to have any serious policing of such events.  I hope that may long remain the position.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the incident referred to was the subject of investigation by An Garda Síochána, which resulted in the submission of an investigation file to the law officers, who directed that a person be charged with manslaughter and assault.  At the ensuing trial directions to acquit were given by the judge.Following the publication of an article concerning this case in October 2010, representations were made requesting an investigation of the matters raised in it.  I understand that the Commissioner arranged for a detective superintendent to meet the author of the article and the persons making the representations to make an assessment whether there was any evidence which was not available to the original investigation team and if further investigation was required in this case.  As a result, a number of lines of inquiry were identified for examination by An Garda Síochána.I am conscious that the matter is one a great concern to the family of the deceased and in this regard I have responded, in so far as I can, to representations made by them and on their behalf.  I am intimately aware of their concerns, having met with them.I have received an update on progress on the matter from the Garda Commissioner but the examination remains ongoing and I expect to receive a further report upon its completion, at which point I will review the situation.  I am well aware of the concerns which have been expressed about this case, but I hope the Deputy will agree that, in the first instance, we need to allow the present Garda examination to proceed to a conclusion.  In that context, I understand that it is expected that the gardaí carrying out the examination will shortly be in a position to report to the Commissioner.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I thank the Minister for his reply.  My understanding is that Detective Superintendent Mangan, who is the head of the cold case unit, has informed journalists and the family within the past two weeks that there is no live investigation nor a review ongoing into the case.  That seems to contradict the information which the Minister has just supplied to the House.  The key point in this regard is why the Garda Commissioner has refused to address claims that were published by this country's most eminent crime reporter, Mr. Paul Williams, that the Garda did a deal with Mr. John Traynor for the return of the Fr. Niall Molloy file which had been previously stolen.  The Commissioner has refused to respond to the claims despite numerous requests from the family.  Will the Minister direct the Garda Commissioner to answer just one question?  Could he indicate whether Mr. Paul Williams was right or wrong about those claims?  Is the answer "Yes" or "No"?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	197	My understanding is that the Deputy was interested in knowing where matters stand with regard to the tragic death that occurred in this case.  When in Opposition I met with the journalist concerned who was referred to in the reply.  On becoming Minister I asked that the matter would be further investigated by An Garda Síochána.  It is not for me to undertake personally that investigation.  That would be highly inappropriate.  The information I have given to the Deputy is the information I have received by way of update on where matters stand.  Given the length of time that has elapsed since this tragic event occurred, I do not know whether there is any practical possibility of making a prosecution.  A variety of issues have been raised surrounding the background to this tragic case and the investigation conducted.  Issues have been raised concerning the trial that occurred, on which I cannot make any comment in the context of the independence of the courts.  I am aware of all of those issues but in respect to this particular matter I must rely on the information given by An Garda Síochána to my Department.  I am afraid I cannot further enlighten the Deputy beyond the information I have given.  I am sure the Deputy would not regard it as appropriate that I would enter into discussions in this House about issues relating to individual files.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Is the Minister not concerned about the allegations made by Mr. Paul Williams that a deal was done with Mr. John Traynor to drop a prosecution for the return of Fr. Molloy's file?  As the Minister is aware, since Fr. Molloy's murder, there has been a litany of questions about the investigation, the subsequent court proceedings, witnesses and so on.  A further question arises in terms of how the file was returned to the Garda.  In this light and given the Minister's pledge in 2010 to have a full independent review of the killing, will he arrange that review and ensure the Garda Commissioner will answer "Yes" or "No" to Paul Williams's claims?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	199	My concern is that, if there is information available to the Garda that was adequate to bring a prosecution against some individual, any such claim should be fully investigated.  It is my understanding the Garda, arising from the issues raised, has engaged in discussions with both the journalist who raised this issue and for whom I have a great deal of respect and with others whom it deems relevant.  My information is that, as matters stand, the position is as detailed by me in my response to the Deputy.  I am not aware personally of any deal being made with anybody in these matters.  I expect that, if there was substantial evidence available to the Garda that merited the taking of a prosecution against anyone following these tragic events, the matter would be fully investigated and a file furnished to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to determining whether there was a basis for bringing a prosecution.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11 and 17 together.As I indicated in my reply to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, the Garda Commissioner has advised me that the Garda investigations in respect of Anglo Irish Bank are substantially complete.  A number of Garda investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions and her independent directions are awaited.  A full investigation team remains employed at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation to conduct necessary follow-up inquiries.  The Commissioner has assured me that this work is receiving absolute priority.  I understand a number of files have also been submitted by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and that he regards the investigative phase of his office's work as almost complete.The latest information I have from the Garda authorities indicates that 23 members of An Garda Síochána are or were engaged in the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank, including nine members of An Garda Síochána currently seconded to the ODCE and 14 personnel at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that it is imperative at this point that nothing is said that might jeopardise any prosecution.Turning to the question of white collar crime generally, I remain resolute in my determination that such crimes be fully investigated in order that the perpetrators may be brought to justice.  This commitment is underscored in the programme for Government and, on taking office, the Government gave priority to satisfying itself that the necessary resources, both personnel and legal, were available to the investigations connected with Anglo Irish Bank.  I was given assurances that this was the case, but I made it clear at all times that I would address any concern brought to my attention.My commitment to tackling white collar crime was further underscored by the swift action I took within eight weeks of taking up office to move urgently to draft and seek Government approval for the introduction of additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Bill 2011, was enacted on 2 August 2011.  I am also bringing forward a new Bill to clarify and strengthen the law on corruption and to replace a number of overlapping corruption Acts stretching back to Victorian times.  The heads of that Bill were published today.On taking office, I raised a number of cases of white collar crime with the Garda Commissioner and I am being briefed on an ongoing basis on the progress of the investigations.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the resources allocated to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation are sufficient to meet the demands placed on it and I will respond, as necessary, to further legislative needs raised by An Garda Síochána or any of the other bodies involved in the investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I have time for two questions from Deputies Joe McHugh and Dara Calleary.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I thank the Minister for his reply and acknowledge his speedy activity at the beginning of the Dáil session in introducing the Criminal Justice Bill 2011.  The programme for Government commits to tackling white collar crime.  I acknowledge that the Garda is playing a proactive and constructive role in investigating these matters at the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  It is important to outline the feelings of the people towards this case, as described on the doorstep during the 2011 general election.  They are not looking for blood on the carpet or heads on a platter, rather they are looking for justice, fairness and a level playing field.  With this in mind-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	203	A question, please.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	204	If we are to follow through fully on the philosophy of fairness and equal treatment, is the Minister satisfied with the powers conferred on the Garda to investigate the matters in question?  I am conscious of the fact that he does not want to make a public comment, as the matter is still at an investigative stage.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The Minister stated that, in the context of this investigation, it was more important to have the same number of people consistently engaging in the investigation.  Were there retirements before the end of February that might delay the investigation?I welcome the publication this morning of the heads of the criminal justice (corruption) Bill.  They are comprehensive and I hope the Minister will not be tempted or forced into watering them down.  He will have my full support.The Minister has a personal problem regarding the subject matter of my question.  In the previous Dáil, particularly in the run-up to the general election, he set himself up as an Eliot Ness figure.  He would take office on his big chariot and sort out issues.  I will remind him of a question he asked at the time, as his response to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien was similar to one provided for him by the former Minister, Dermot Ahern.  The Minister asked: "Does the Minister not understand that when someone who has not paid a fine of €250 ends up in Mountjoy Prison, someone who drives a truck into the gates of Leinster House ends up before the courts within 24 hours and bankers responsible for bringing the State to its knees and costing taxpayers €50 billion have not been brought before the courts it genuinely gives rise to a sense of public outrage, utter confusion and undermines confidence in our legal system?"  This question is as true 15 months into his tenure as Minister as it was when he made it from this chair.The Minister shares my frustration.  Like the former Minister, he is also independent.  Will he guarantee that there is an awareness within the law offices of the State of the importance of bringing this issue to a conclusion or putting it on a path that will bring it to a conclusion as soon as possible?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	206	To respond to Deputy Joe McHugh, on my very first day in the Department of Justice and Equality I raised with my officials issues relating to these investigations and asked whether there was anything additional I could do as Minister and whether additional legislation or other additional resources were required.  What was needed was the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  I do not know why my predecessor did not enact that legislation.  It was of huge importance because at the time there were individuals obstructing the Garda investigation, not making available crucial information that was necessary and not giving access to information held electronically.  This would have advanced the investigation if the previous Government had enacted that legislation.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	207	It has been in place for one year and we have gone no further.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The legislation facilitated the Garda in progressing its work.  The legislation that was through this House by July last year resulted in the first application being made to the District Court on 6 September last year.  It proved very effective in accessing information.  I am advised the powers given by it enabled the Garda to secure co-operation from a number of individuals who at that point were being unco-operative.  If there was anything additional by way of legislation that the Garda or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement required to be done, I can give the Deputy an absolute assurance it would be done.I have to say to Deputy Calleary that I am amused of the image of myself as Eliot Ness.  I have no illusions of being Eliot Ness.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The Minister is more Inspector Clouseau.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Nor am I as deluded as a certain Member, currently absent from the Chamber, who seems to think he is the reincarnation of Mahatma Ghandi or a Nelson Mandela-like figure.  I do not suffer any of those particular illusions.While I cannot in any way engage with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, because it is an independent office, I am absolutely sure the director appreciates the importance of these particular matters, the extensive nature of the investigations that have been conducted, the large resources utilised in the conduct of them and the importance, if criminality has been revealed, of assessing without undue delay whether there is adequate evidence available to support the taking of a prosecution.  Like all Members, I am anxious that we get clarity on that as early as possible.  In fairness to the DPP, it is important that any decisions made are considered and based on the totality of the information and evidence available.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important issue on the floor of the House today.  The air accident investigation unit is investigating what the Defence Forces called a heavy landing but was in fact a crash by the Air Corps of a Eurocopter helicopter operating the emergency aeromedical service, EAS, in County Tipperary yesterday.  Significant damage was done to the helicopter but, thankfully, the Air Corps crew and Health Service Executive, HSE, paramedic staff escaped without injury.  I hope the patient they were hoping to transfer is making a full recovery in hospital now.  I understand the patient ended up being transferred by road to hospital.The accident happened as a result of the helicopter becoming entangled in overhead electricity cables.  The ambulance service feeds instructions to the Air Corps about potential landing sites for the airlifting of patients.  What role did ground crew play in this?  Significant damage has been done to the tail section of the helicopter.  What is the extent of this damage?  How long will it be before it is put back into service?  What are the contingency plans for this service?  There is one other Eurocopter helicopter available.  Will it be made operational to get the EAS back in place?  If so, when will it be made operational?Why was the choice made for the Eurocopter rather than the Augusta Westland helicopter?  The latter is fully equipped to provide 24-hour air ambulance missions while the Eurocopter can only operate in daylight.  Across the world there have been accidents involving emergency aeromedical services because it is a risky business and requires skilled staff.  Why were designated landing sites not used in this process before the service was put up and running?  A list was compiled in some local authority areas of specific designated sites where an ambulance could actually meet the helicopter and have no issues with overhead lines.  For some reason, this was not put into the final protocols for this service.  Why was this the case?Is the EAS regulated by the Irish Aviation Authority?  If not, why not?  Who is responsible for regulating the medical aspect of the service?  Yesterday's accident was extremely unfortunate and gives rise to several questions that need to be answered.  We want to see a fully fledged EAS operational across the island.  We want to ensure those involved not just in traumas but who have had a stroke or heart attack can be airlifted in the minimum time to the nearest centre of excellence.  The reason for the establishment of this service was the closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon County Hospital.  People who suffer a heart attack, strike or a trauma in the hospital's catchment area cannot be brought to Galway University Hospital within the golden 90 minutes required.  I look forward to the Minister's response.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	212	A 12 month pilot EAS in support of the HSE national ambulance service commenced operations on 4 June 2012.  The service is operated by the Air Corps out of Custume Barracks, Athlone.  The purpose of the pilot is to determine the extent, if any, of the need for dedicated aeromedical support to emergency ambulances in the region in light of existing road networks and transit times.  The service is intended to support the requirements of HSE clinical care programmes such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke.  In geographical terms, the primary focus of the service is on the west and north west.  However, the service can on occasion respond to incidents elsewhere where aeromedical assistance is an appropriate response given the circumstances of the incident.From 4 June to date, 11 aeromedical missions have been undertaken.  An incident involving the EAS helicopter occurred yesterday afternoon, 19 June.  The helicopter, an EC 135, departed Custume Barracks, Athlone, at 1.50 p.m.en route to an emergency call out in County Tipperary.  At approximately 2.10 p.m. the helicopter was forced to perform a heavy landing near Borrisoleigh, County Tipperary.  Thankfully, the two Air Corps crew and one HSE paramedic on board were uninjured.  The patient who was subject to the call-out was transferred to hospital by road.  The helicopter has been removed from the site of the incident and is now back in Baldonnel, but the extent of damage to it has yet to be determined.The air accident investigation unit in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was informed of the incident immediately and was in attendance at the site last evening.  The unit will carry out an investigation into the incident.  The Air Corps is examining the likelihood of resuming the EAS as soon as possible using an AW 139 aircraft out of Baldonnel.  At this stage, it is not possible to say when the service will resume from Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Following a preliminary investigation by the air accident investigation unit, this matter will receive further consideration.It should be emphasised the EAS is a separate service from the air ambulance service provided by the Air Corps to the HSE for inter-hospital transfer of patients with serious injuries and for organ retrieval missions.  This service is unaffected by this incident.  The aircraft is crewed by an Air Corps pilot and crewman, supported by an Air Corps ground technician.  The EC 135 helicopter is a light utility aircraft that is the appropriate platform for an air ambulance given its size and weight.  It is used in other EU countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany for air ambulance services.

Will the Minister give an indication of the likely timeline for it to be based in Custume Barracks to provide an emergency aeromedical service?  Why was the helicopter not used in the first instance to provide the service, as it has 24 hour capability?What was the role of the ground crew in this incident?  Was the forced landing site close to where the helicopter was travelling to meet the patient and what liaison took place with the ground crew?  The original protocol involved the use of designated landing sites throughout the midlands and west, at which the helicopter would land and meet the local ambulance called to the scene.  Why was that protocol not implemented when the air ambulance service was launched earlier this month?  That would have prevented yesterday's incident from occurring.  Who is involved in the regulation of the aeromedical service?  Is the Irish Air Authority involved?  Who is responsible for the medical aspects?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I will deal with some of the issues raised by the Deputy, although I cannot respond to certain questions because I will not prejudge the outcome of the investigation being conducted.  Issues raised by the Deputy are directly relevant to that investigation and it is appropriate that we learn the answers from the investigation.The helicopter involved in the unfortunate accident yesterday was deemed to be the appropriate aircraft as it was based in Custume Barracks and in the context of providing the service as I described it.  It is of a type that is used appropriately for this service elsewhere.  There is an issue with the size of helicopter used with reference to the aircraft that can be appropriately accommodated in Custume Barracks because of its proximity to what is generally an open urban area.One of the issues with regard to the resumption of the service from Custume Barracks concerns the damage, if any, done to the medical equipment for this helicopter in order to provide the service deemed to be important to benefit the area.  The preliminary investigation by the air accident investigation unit must take place first, as no medical equipment can be accessed or removed from the helicopter until after the investigation is complete.  It will then be further assessed in terms of its suitability for future use.  I do not know if the same equipment can be used in another helicopter, or if additional equipment may be required.There are a number of questions asked by the Deputy for which I do not have an immediate answer.  I hope we will have the answers in the not too distant future.  I am very conscious that the service was put in place to benefit a great many people in the region and that it was widely welcomed.  I hope that, as envisaged, it will be able to resume it without undue delay.  The incident was most unfortunate, but I am pleased no serious injury resulted from it, which obviously would have been a matter of concern.  It is not clear to me when the damaged helicopter will be back in service or what work will require to be undertaken on it.  I hope to have the answers to these questions within a reasonable period.  I want to be able to state without undue delay what the position is on providing an ongoing service.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I wish to raise the matter of high loan refusal rates and the detrimental effects they are having on small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and their vital recovery.  From speaking to local business people in my constituency who are struggling to survive and pay back loans, this issue needs to be addressed in real terms.  It is suggested banks are putting already pressurised businesses into further decline by withdrawing their overdraft facilities and restructuring them into term loans.  This means that small businesses are now operating outside the original terms, which leads to their credit rating disappearing for anything up to six years and access to necessary funding drying up completely.  Banks, on the other hand, are stating their current mechanisms for restructuring loans are helping SMEs to continue to operate, although I argue that this is clearly not the case.Evidence appears in a recent survey carried out by the independent organisation working in support of the Irish small and medium enterprises, ISME, sector which confirms in its latest quarterly bank watch survey that the refusal rate of loans to SMEs has risen to 54% after slight improvements in the previous two quarters.  It also indicates that 37% of respondents to the survey had requested additional or new bank facilities in the past three months, an increase of 6% on the figure for the same quarter in 2011.  In addition, around 80% of businesses which had applied for funding outlined that banks were making it more troublesome for them to access the funding they needed to remain afloat.In the light of the volume of SMEs in real financial trouble, the entire credit rating system needs to be reviewed if they are to be given proper opportunities and have   prospects for recovery.  It has been widely reported that there is a high percentage of SMEs with restructured loans on bank books and no access to further loan or overdraft facilities from banks.  It is certainly time to reduce the period of credit blacklisting from six years to two as a means to improve the position for all small and medium enterprises.  This would allow them time to repay their existing loans, while providing access to cash injections, if necessary, within an earlier timeframe.We must carefully assess and address this matter by taking definitive action before it becomes too late for many SMEs which are doing their very best to keep the wolves from the door and those of their employees also.  If we cannot offer them real support in these unprecedented economically turbulent times, how can we really expect the sector to survive, much less thrive?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I thank the Deputy for raising this most important issue of credit availability for small and medium enterprises.  One of the key priorities of the programme for Government is to ensure an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme of the banks.  The Government has introduced a number of policy tools to achieve this objective.  For example, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two pillar banks - Bank of Ireland and AIB - to provide for lending in excess of €30 billion from 2011 to 2013.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16 billion to €20 billion during this period.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for the repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals during the period.The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years from 2011 to 2013.  Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities for SMEs.  They achieved their lending targets for 2011.In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks, the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  They also meet the Department and the Credit Review Office on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The Credit Review Office reviews decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities from €1,000 up to €500,000.  The office is overturning 60% of the decisions referred to it, supplying €6.9 million of credit and supporting 683 jobs in the SME sector.  I appeal to SMEs that have been refused credit by banks to avail of the services of the CRO.  That is what it is there for and it clearly has a track record of making decisions in favour of SMEs where a negative decision has been made by the banks.In November 2011, the Government committed to completing an annual action plan for jobs that would involve the whole of Government focusing on what part it and its agencies could play in protecting or creating jobs.  A key component of the plan is to ensure that viable SMEs can access credit and the plan introduces a number of important measures to achieve this objective.The temporary partial credit guarantee scheme aims to provide credit to job-creating SMEs that currently struggle to get finance from the banks.  It is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable businesses in two specific situations, namely, where businesses have insufficient collateral and where businesses operate in sectors with which the banks are not familiar.  In addition, a micro-finance fund to provide loans to small businesses is also being developed within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.The first meeting of the reinstated SME credit consultation committee took place on Tuesday, 12 June.  The role of this committee is to provide a forum where stakeholders can communicate and interact regarding difficulties in respect of credit.I should also note yesterday's launch by the Minister for Finance of Silicon Valley Bank's commitment, in collaboration with the National Pensions Reserve Fund, of a minimum of US$100 million in new lending to fast-growing Irish companies in the high tech technology and innovation sector.In November 2011 Mazars published a report commissioned by the Department of Finance outlining the situation in credit demand by SMEs in the period April to September 2011.  This was an extensive survey of firms across the SME sector conducted by a professional market survey company.  Of the 1,500 SMEs surveyed, only 36% requested bank credit in the period and, of these credit applications, some 70% were approved or partially approved when pending applications were excluded.  As I mentioned earlier, the Credit Review Office offers an important mechanism separate from the banks' internal appeals procedures for SMEs to have the decision of the bank reviewed.  The Government would encourage more active use of the office by those companies that feel aggrieved at the decision of the banks on their credit applications.It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I thank the Minister for State for his reply.  I welcome the fact the Credit Review Office has overturned 60% of decisions.  Many SMEs in my constituency that have been dealing with the banks and that have restructured their loans find it difficult to deal with the banks after restructuring.  They feel they have been blacklisted and there is no point in them going to the Credit Review Office.  That is a problem and the entire credit rating system should be examined.  If we are to move forward, we do not need to place debt upon debt.  Many of these businesses are doing okay but they need some cash flow.  When an overdraft is converted into a long-term loan to a business, the business is being starved of cash flow.  Something should be done to ensure these people have some sort of overdraft.  I welcome the overturning of 60% of decisions but we must examine the credit rating system because we are in different times and it is now outdated.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The Deputy makes a valid point.  It is one question to look at how much money is being lent into the real economy and how much is being drawn down but it is entirely separate to look at the credit rating system that surrounds those businesses that have experienced difficult times.  If there is an effective blacklisting or negative mark against those businesses that have gone through restructuring, it is a very important issue we must examine.The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, has completed seven regional meetings around the country.  Those meetings were with stakeholders, the very businesses to which he referred in his speech.  A report will be published shortly and the issue to which he referred in respect of credit ratings was raised at those meetings.  If additional action can be taken by Government, we will do that.I also understand that the Mazars report for the next six months will be also issued shortly.  It did the initial work in this area and produced the more relevant data because of the numbers responding to the survey.  On the specific issues to which the Deputy referred - the credit rating system - we will have two reports, one from Mazars and one from the Department of Finance, that will consider this question, along with other issues.I appeal again that where businesses have been refused credit and an opportunity to draw down funds from a bank, the issue should be taken up with the Credit Review Office, which has overturned 60% of decisions that were taken.  That shows the Credit Review Office is on the side of the borrower and the person who is attempting to restructure his business and secure investment so the economy will get back on its feet.  That message should be highlighted by this House and I thank the Deputy for raising it.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue that came to light last week.  It is a perfect example of a topical issue.The Minister of State will be aware due to his own situation in Galway and his position in the Department of the emotive nature of SNA provision.  Every case is exceptional but because of the unique circumstances surrounding the Maria Immaculata community college in Dunmanway, it is particularly exceptional because there is a designated special unit in the school and, as a result, there are special classes.  I am sure the Minister of State will say in his reply that there are SNAs in the mainstream as well but we must bear in mind in this case that there will be 17 pupils in a special class in this school from September.The Minister of State will know that the National Council for Special Education announced last week  the resource teaching and SNA posts for the 2012-13 school year.  There is considerable merit that there has been no change in the overall level of resources for allocation to schools but I wish to bring to his attention the particular case of MICC in Dunmanway.  Last week the college was informed it would lose four SNAs in September, with numbers falling from 15 to 11.  This is a disturbing and distressing move for the parents of children in the special classes.  It is an exceptional case in my view.  The number of special needs children will increase by two in September but the overall SNA allocation will decrease by four.  That is particularly difficult to comprehend when we consider the overall level of SNAs in the system will remain the same for the 2012-13 academic year as for the 2011-12 academic year.MICC is home to a designated special needs unit, which is growing by two, making it one of the biggest groups of its kind in the Munster region.  Disabilities in the unit are complex and wide-ranging.  Some pupils have incontinence issues and sensory difficulties and need assistance with basic living skills, such as eating or going to the bathroom.  The prospect of having to share various SNAs throughout the day is untenable for certain pupils because their needs are so multifaceted.    I have been in regular contact with the parents and teaching staff of MICC since news of the SNA reduction first reached them last week.  What has clearly been communicated to me is that stability and consistency in the support they receive are key for all of the pupils.  Nurturing and developing stable and consistent relationships between pupils and their SNAs can take years, as it takes time for pupils to settle into a routine, adapt to a system and get used to an SNA, but this is set to be undermined, with many pupils moving from having their own SNA to merely having access to one.There is also a tangible fear among parents that special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are overriding the views of psychologists and disregarding psychological assessment reports that recommend a certain level of SNA provision for a child.  They are particularly worried about the ruling that psychologists should not make specific recommendations.  I sincerely hope that is not the case and I have every faith that SENOs will take into serious consideration the assessments provided for them and the interaction between psychologists and SNAs.  It is worth bearing this issue in mind in the debate.I have spoken to an official in the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, about the case at MICC and in the next few weeks I intend to have a face to face meeting with the local SENO, with whom I hope to interact on the rationale and logic behind the decision.  What I find most difficult about the issue is the process involved in arriving at a conclusion such as this.  I acknowledge the fact that the overall SNA allocation will be the same in 2012-13 as this year.  That is important when one considers that the Government is borrowing €1.25 billion a month to fund essential public services before it ever goes near the banking debt.  Many cases will rightly be made to Ministers and the Government to retain services in various areas, but this is one area in which every effort should be made to retain the level of service provided.  I ask the Minister of State to be cognisant of this.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I am taking this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank the Deputy for raising it, as it gives me an opportunity to clarify to the House the position on the allocation of SNAs for the coming year.The Government, as the Deputy confirmed, has maintained funding for resources for children with special educational needs at a time when there is a continued requirement to make expenditure savings across a number of other areas.  We are providing 10,575 SNA posts for allocation to schools for the 2012-13 school year.  As the Deputy acknowledged, this is the same number of posts available for allocation for the current year.  There has been no reduction in the overall number of SNA posts available in the coming school year.  It is considered that, with prudent management of these resources, there will be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with my Department's criteria.The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local SENOs, for allocating SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The council operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support which now includes a requirement for them to have regard to the overall cap on numbers.  Schools had been advised to make applications to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2012-13 school year by 16 March 2012 and they are being notified of their allocations based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  In determining the level of SNA support allocated to a school the NCSE takes into account the individual care needs of all qualifying children, supports freed up owing to school leavers and the identified care needs of newly enrolled children with special educational needs.It is important to note that a school's allocation of SNA support may alter from year to year as pupils enrol or leave or where a child's care needs have diminished over time.  As there have been no reductions in the overall number of SNAs available for allocation in the coming school year, no school will lose SNAs because of cuts.  Changes to the allocation of SNAs to a school, therefore, will arise because either the number of qualifying children has changed owing to pupils enrolling or leaving a school or because the assessed needs of the qualifying children have changed, for example, where pupils may have developed increased independence.  In a small number of cases schools may have had surplus SNAs who were not removed when children left school or needs changed.  In such cases the NCSE will adjust the allocation to the schools to reflect the needs of the children enrolled.The NCSE has confirmed that the SNA allocation for the school in question for the 2012-13 academic year reflects the level of care needs identified in the qualifying applications and represents a sufficient level of support to cater for the care needs of all qualifying children for the coming school year.  I understand the NCSE has been in contact with the Deputy in recent days to clarify the position in this regard.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I have been in contact with the council.  I am deeply uncomfortable with the fact that while the system has retained the overall number of SNAs, the number allocated to MICC will reduce from 15 to 11.  We can use whatever statistics and information are available, but it is inescapable that the number will reduce from 15 to 11, despite the Minister of State saying, "As there have been no reductions in the overall number of SNAs available for allocation in the coming school year, no school will lose SNAs because of cuts."  I am having great difficulty understanding the absence of logic in arriving at the decision relating to MICC.The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has ring-fenced, albeit through the health budget, €40 million for adults with intellectual disabilities and makes the point consistently that resources should follow the individual.  Nobody has a difficulty with this.  It is positive that the school system has retained the overall number of SNAs when it stands to reason that demand will increase, but it is difficult for parents of pupils at MICC to head into the summer knowing that their SNA allocation will reduce from 15 to 11, while the overall number has been retained.  This is an exceptional case because there is a special unit in the school.I welcome the NCSE's confirmation that it is developing an appeals process which is expected to be finalised in late August.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to consider a robust appeals system that will take into account the exceptional case that undoubtedly can be made for this school.  This is a special, not a mainstream, class with special needs children.  God knows, any of us would go through fire and water for them as parents.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I apologise if my reply was not clear, but I reiterate that no SNAs will be lost owing to budgetary cuts.  The same SNA provision will be made next year as in previous years.  Changes to the SNA allocation in a school relate to the evolving care needs of its pupils.  For example, children may have diminishing care needs over time or a number of children will leave school at the end of each academic year and the school population may change over time.  I am aware of a number of parents who are happy that their child no longer needs an SNA in a school setting.  Assessment of service is ongoing to ensure children who genuinely need SNA support are getting it and those who have reached a point where they do not need such support no longer receive it in order that resources can be allocated where they are badly needed.  It is not in the interests of a child for the NCSE to leave an SNA in place where he or she has achieved greater independence because this can impact negatively on his or her development.We trust, as we should, the NCSE to make these decisions on the care needs of children.  We will be in a difficult place if we seek to somehow usurp or undermine that expertise.  I have no problem engaging further with the Deputy in an effort to address his valid concerns and perhaps provide a more detailed response for him on the decision taken regarding the school in question.  It is important to stress, however, that SNAs are not removed because of budgetary reductions; they are removed because the care needs of children within schools are evolving.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue as a Topical Issue matter.  It was brought to my attention by Councillor Paul McAuliffe, who represents the Finglas-Ballymun ward in north Dublin, that an X-ray machine purchased for some €500,000 in 2006 as part of the fit-out of the health centre at the Ballymun civic offices has never been used.  I had to read the entire Health Service Executive report on the matter before I could be convinced he was correct in his information.  A spokesperson for the HSE, indicating that it was not financially viable to use the expensive scanner at present, further stated:Following wide consultation with relevant clinicians regarding the X-ray machine, which was installed in the Ballymun health centre as part of the initial fit-out, it has been decided that in the current economic climate and with reduced resources, it would not be prudent to invest further in the X-ray facility...  This decision was taken following consideration of the highly responsive X-ray service currently available, the fact that plain X-ray is only occasionally used in routine GP investigations and due to the potential waste involved in investing in a service that would result in the under utilisation of staff and the equipment.The spokesperson went on to indicate that alternative venues had been explored but the costs associated with relocating the X-ray machine were, in the current climate, prohibitive.There must be a further evaluation of the HSE's position in regard to the relocation of the machine.  Surely this costly equipment could be put to good use elsewhere if it is not needed in the Ballymun area because of the X-ray services that are already available there.  Has an evaluation been done of the depreciation to which the machine has been subjected and do we know how much it is now worth?  Has the HSE undertaken an extensive review of potential alternative locations or considered the possibility of selling the machine?  The Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall, can rightly say this situation did not arise on her watch, but it is now her responsibility to find a solution to what is an appalling waste of public money.  Councillor McAuliffe has written to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts seeking an investigation of the matter.  In these straitened times, it is simply unacceptable that a machine worth up to €500,000 has been lying idle for six years.  It is not good enough merely to have a statement from the HSE that the situation has been evaluated and it would be too expensive to relocate the equipment.  The machine could be used elsewhere, or sold.  What is certain, however, is that it should not be left to lie idle and depreciate in value in the years ahead.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Deputy on an issue with which I am very familiar.  The Health Service Executive established the Ballymun primary health care facility at the civic offices in April 2006.  It is fine facility offering a wide range of services including an X-ray suite.  The latter was fully commissioned in 2008 but, as I understand it, it was not possible to staff it due to the moratorium on recruitment.The fact that this facility was lying idle was brought to my attention last year, whereupon I visited the site and raised the matter with the HSE on several occasions.  As a result of those inquiries, the HSE established an assessment team in 2011 comprising the area manager for north Dublin city and the national clinical leads for primary care and emergency medicine to explore evidence-based options for the use of the X-ray machine that was installed as part of the centre fit-out.  Following wide consultation with relevant clinicians, it was decided that in the current economic climate and in view of reduced resources, it would not be prudent to invest further in the X-ray facility.  As the Deputy observed, this decision was taken following consideration of the highly responsive X-ray service currently available, the fact that plain X-ray is only occasionally used in routine GP investigations and taking account of the potential waste involved in investing in a service that would result in the under utilisation of staff and equipment.The assessment team found that the existing X-ray services for north Dublin are very good and that there is no waiting time for trauma cases or chest X-ray referrals.  The service at the Mater hospital was found to operate very successfully as a walk-in facility and GP satisfaction with the service is very high.  The availability of the community rapid access clinic at Smithfield has, the team concluded, provided another option for GPs.  It was further observed that Beaumont Hospital operates a similar service with equally high levels of local GP satisfaction.  While it was decided to explore the option of relocating the X-ray machine, the costs associated with moving and installing it in the current climate were found to be prohibitive.  The HSE will consider other options regarding the future of the machine, but no consideration has been given as of yet to selling it.I am loath to lose an important item of medical equipment from the primary care service or the public health system generally and I am keen to ensure it is brought into use as soon as possible.  Therefore, I have asked the special delivery unit to ascertain whether it could be used as part of the unit's work in taking pressure off local hospitals.  I await a response in this regard.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  There is a positive in this in the acknowledgement that there are reasonable X-ray facilities available between the Mater hospital, the rapid access clinic at Smithfield and Beaumont Hospital.  I am not asking the Minister of State to give firm commitments today but she might consider whether this expensive equipment could be incorporated into the roll-out of primary care centres.  In an area where there is a deficiency of X-ray facilities to GPs, the machine could, perhaps by way of a lease arrangement, be pressed into service.  It might even be given as a gift from the State to the State as part of its regional primary care programme.  Every option must be considered to ensure this machine is plugged in and used for the benefit of the citizens who do not have access to X-ray services on a walk-in basis.  The last thing we need is for this issue to be brought before the Committee of Public Accounts and tied up for ages in discussions about what went wrong while the machine remains idle in Ballymun.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	226	It is a shame that the necessary resources for staffing were not provided when the facility was established in 2006.  It is yet another example of poor planning within the health service, where capital and revenue are often not co-ordinated.  It is important to point out that there is changed thinking in regard to diagnostics.  There are concerns, for example, about having an X-ray machine in a primary care facility on the basis that it is unlikely there would be sufficient critical mass to justify the provision of attendant staff.  The thinking now tends to be that where one has X-ray facilities, it is important also to have the follow-on services on the same site.I take the Deputy's point, however, and agree that the current situation is far from ideal.  I would very much like to see the machine brought into use, but I understand the cost of moving it would be substantial, being in the region of €85,000.  We are considering all possibilities with a view to seeing if it can be used.  It is a shame to see facilities like this lying idle.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising the matter.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I welcome the opportunity to continue my contribution to this debate.  All speakers have referred to the background to the Bill and why it is necessary.  The only difficulty is that it has taken a long time for it to reach this stage.  We must ensure it completes its passage through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.Before the debate adjourned I was discussing the issue of planning, payment and performance bonds.  As it stands, no consideration whatsoever is given to the ability or track record of a contractor with regard to payment of suppliers in the awarding of either public or private contracts.  In this situation having a requirement for the provision of security for payment, as applies in other countries, is by far the most effective means of protecting suppliers.  That is the view set out by the Irish Concrete Federation and we all appreciate from where it is coming.During the regulatory impact assessment process which I mentioned and in which many others and I were involved I referred to the US Miller Act.  The payment of bonds to protect suppliers of labour and materials must be made a requirement for contractors who tender for projects, as is the case under the Miller Act which requires that a performance bond to protect the client be put in place and a payment bond to protect suppliers be lodged by the contractor before the contract is awarded for the construction of any federal government funded project.  There is a value in that requirement.There may be other ways to deal with this aspect, but this is an issue on which we will have to come to a firm conclusion.  I have an open mind, but that is one possibility.  However, there would be a cost to the contractor in obtaining a payment bond.  Many contractors are being offered projects, but they are having difficulty in obtaining bonds from their banks to secure the contracts.  It would be an extra imposition on contractors to have to produce a payment bond in addition to the current bond arrangement and it would be an additional cost which, ultimately, would have to be borne by whoever was paying for the contract and would have to be built into the tendering process.  That is one possibility, but I am not saying it is the best way to go.I have a different view.  During the regulatory impact assessment process I said that at the tendering stage the previous payment record should be taken into account.  There should be some provision in the tendering process whereby people must confirm that they have complied with previous Labour Court adjudications.  A parliamentary question was tabled recently to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about people against whom there were outstanding Labour Court judgments.  The people concerned can still be granted new contracts and the Minister did not give a satisfactory reply.  He said there was not an equivalent mechanism to the tax clearance certificate in place whereby one could obtain a certificate from the Labour Court to say one was compliant.  Nobody was suggesting this because it would be enormously cumbersome.  The vast majority of people never have to go near the Labour Court, whereas everyone has to go to the Revenue Commissioners.  People must comply and if it is found they have not, they will be in breach of their tendering and contract notice.When a local authority grants planning permission, it writes to the person concerned stating its intention to grant planning permission in 28 days.  During those 28 days others have an opportunity to appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála.  If there is no appeal, permission is granted.  We see notices in the newspapers of the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to grant a licence for a waste facility and people have 28 days during which to come forward.  In the case of publicly funded contracts, a public notice should be published in whatever medium is deemed appropriate stating it is intended to grant a contract to a company in 28 days.  This would give anybody who had not been paid for a job done for the contractor time to come forward.  Some 20 people could arrive at the contracting authority's head office to say they had been not paid for the last job done.The importance of this provision is that it would not only apply to direct subcontractors.  There could be a chain of subcontractors and suppliers down the line.  It would put the onus on the main contractor to ensure his or her subcontractors behaved themselves because it is not always the case that the main contractor is not paying the subcontractor.  The problem could be further down the line in that the subcontractors have not paid those whom they engage.  This mechanism would ensure the main contractor only employed reputable subcontractors whom he or she knew would not interfere with his or her ability to be given future jobs.  If people were to come out of the woodwork after 28 days and one was to find out that a company had a bad track record, it should not be given any further work.  It is as simple as that.  If it does something once, shame on it, but if it does it twice, shame on us.  If that does not happen, I will have to be convinced on Committee Stage that something better is being done.The big issue about which we will talk on Committee Stage is the supply of materials and bespoke products.  The retention of title does not count in these situations.  One cannot grab concrete from the ground as it is not a moveable fixture or fitting.  The Irish Concrete Federation, those involved in quarries and who provide tarmacadam are very involved in this issue.  It also applies to people who provide bespoke products, whether they be customised windows, doors, electrical fittings, heating installation equipment, etc. which cannot be removed.  A provision must be included to facilitate them.There should not be a differentiation between public and private contracts.  The same rules should apply to every category of business.  A different set of rules should not be introduced in this legislation.  There are arrangements in place for publicly funded contracts, but they are not working because we would not be speaking about this issue if they were.  INobody should talk about the current arrangements in place.The Construction Industry Federation stated in one of its magazines recently that 90% of all disputes were settled on the steps of the court after proceedings had taken place and all legal costs had been incurred.  We want to reach a situation where a adjudication would be binding.  I understand there is always a legal right not to abide by it, but if it is undermined by not having strong legal force behind it, people will not pay attention to the adjudication process.  The regulatory impact assessment process will remind us to take into account the views of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators which has gone through the issue.  Most of us who will be involved on Committee Stage have received correspondence from it.  It makes a few excellent points, but time does not permit me to read them.The most important point on contracts, whether public or private, concerns the ability of small and medium-sized businesses to receive them, but the threshold is too high.  One must have had a high level of turnover in the past three years.  Many companies which have built housing schemes would not qualify to complete two further houses for the local authority because of the reduction in their turnover in the past couple of years, even though they built hundreds perhaps one decade ago.  There must be some mechanism to rebalance the position.  Some 99% of contracts of awarded by the State should be given to Irish companies, as happens in every other EU country.  They are able to do so under the same EU arrangements, but we have been soft on the issue.  We must be as tough as other countries and construct our tendering process to suit Irish businesses, as they do for theirs.  We should look after own.

This is another example of how politics is changing because the Bill started out as a Private Members' Bill in the other House where it was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn whom I am delighted to see in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  It has made its way through following a change of Government to be presented to us.  As I am sure the Senator knows, if we pass it, it will be the first which started out as a Private Members' Bill in the other House to be passed since 1965.  It is the new politics the people want to see and I hope we will continue to do things like this in the coming years.In the programme for Government the Government committed to protecting all small business subcontractors who had been denied payment by larger companies.  The Bill introduces a new dispute resolution system for subcontractors in order that they will not have to wait years for payment from larger contractors.  It also allows for contracts to provide for interim payments during the duration of a contract.  It is very worthwhile legislation, but some issues have been raised with me by a number of small contractors.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, may also have been contacted by them because they were from the east Meath-Drogheda area.  I am sure he is familiar with these issues.One issue concerns the proposed €200,000 threshold for contracts that fall within the scope of the Bill.  This provision caused some unease among many small businesses which felt they would be left out in the cold by the high limit.  The Bill would have done nothing for them at all and would have meant continued non-payment for work.  It would have put some of the businesses under financial pressure.  Many of the businesses are struggling because of the economic climate.  I have raised this issue with the Minister on numerous occasions.  I was very glad when I received word from his office that the proposed financial thresholds are to be re-examined.  In effect, they will be reduced considerably, or possibly removed from the legislation.  This is excellent news for small subcontractors and I very much welcome it.I wish to raise another issue that has been raised with me in respect of this Bill and on which issue I have not received clarification.  I hope we will receive clarification in the Minister of State's closing remarks.  Will the Bill help suppliers of construction products that are irretrievable from a site because they have been incorporated into the structure of a building?  An example includes subcontractors who provide tiling to a larger contractor.  One cannot take tiling or a partition wall away from a site after installation.  Will subcontractors in this category be included in the legislation?  Perhaps the Minister of State will confirm this in his closing remarks.I hope we can pass this legislation as soon as possible, preferably before the summer recess.  There are many businesses that need to see the legislation put into law as soon as possible.  They will welcome it and so will we.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I welcome the Bill.  It was introduced in the Seanad by Senator Feargal Quinn, who is present to observe this debate.  The Bill passed through the Seanad and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, worked on it.  It is a Private Members' Bill, which is very welcome because it is important that legislation passed in the House not always be Government legislation.  It is very rare for a Private Members' Bill to be accepted by the Government and taken on board.  I welcome this.I wish to make a point on the importance of the Seanad.  Under the Constitution, legislators operate in a bicameral system with a three-part structure involving the Dáil, Seanad and President.  It is a question of checks and balances and protection.  The Seanad can provide extra scrutiny and legislative proposals.  This Bill demonstrates the value of the Seanad in our parliamentary democracy.  I am aware there was a vote in the Seanad today in which it asserted its independence in a motion on Seanad reform.  Eradicating the Seanad without considering the consequences for our democracy poses a problem.  It is important the Dáil considers the matter sympathetically.The Bill addresses a very important issue which has been more pronounced during the recession but which was probably relevant before it, albeit not to the same extent.  As a Deputy, I was approached with regard to this issue by a number of sole traders and small business people working in the construction sector.  They outlined the impact on their businesses if they did not receive payment for the work they had done.  It is very important for a business to have cashflow.  Money is not exactly forthcoming from the banks or other sources.  In this context, it is very important that construction work carried out be paid for.People who carry out surveying work have raised the issue of not being paid on time.  In one case, a contractor had not been paid because of a hold-up at local authority level.  Therefore, the problem is not associated with the private sector alone.While the legislation is very welcome, I contend there are many issues that need to be addressed in respect of construction.  It has been brought to my attention by many contractors that while they are compliant regarding their obligations concerning payments, wages and conditions, including the payment of workers' pensions, some companies that receive State work and which are paid from State coffers are not compliant and have been brought before the Labour Court because of various practices.  This is not just speculation because I am aware of one case reported in the newspapers in that regard.  I have raised this issue a number of times through parliamentary questions and I have written to the relevant Ministers about it.  There needs to be an even playing pitch for construction workers.  We should reward those who have done the work and who are compliant in respect of various liabilities concerning tax, wages, conditions and pensions.
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Hindsight is great.  If we were to examine the history of the economic downturn and its effect on the construction sector, our hindsight would show that subcontractors and others working in the sector were clearly not properly protected.  This Bill seeks to address the imbalance and protect the workers concerned.  If we are to do anything during the term of this Dáil, we must consider all the dreadful mistakes of the past, the blind eye that was turned to various practices, the complete indifference to the market, etc. and try to put some protections in place to remedy what occurred.  We should use this term to ensure that what we construct over the next five to 15 years as an economy will be different from what preceded it and that we look after people.  This Bill is a small but very significant piece in the larger puzzle that is being solved and I am delighted to support it.The reason I chose to speak on this Bill is the great cross-party support for it.  Countless subcontractors and others who worked in the building industry have come to see me in Galway and I have spoken to them.  Irrespective of whether the contracts are big or small, contractors fear being at the mercy of a large developer.  We must never forget the significant power play that took place.  Very large developers and companies with considerable assets were able to dictate terms in many respects and completely set the agenda regarding contracts and operations.  If one tried to go against this or to assert oneself, one found very quickly that one was excluded from subsequent contracts or one was treated so badly or poorly that one was forced out of a contract.  There was an imbalance and this Bill will go a long way towards redressing it.I read Senator Quinn's opening speech in the Seanad.  He spoke, quite rightly, about how corporate and company law allows large companies to set up various companies.  The corporate veil was not simply between the developer and the company.  There were many different corporate veils protecting people from various factors.  We may have to consider the means by which company law, which involves limited liability, can be and has been abused.  In this House, it was recognised recently how company law has protected people.  It has been abused and we need to put in place protections for those who are suffering.What I like about the Bill is that it is putting the architecture on a statutory footing.  For far too long, we have regarded the introduction of codes of conduct and best practice guidelines for businesses as sufficient, but this has always been the weak approach in that it really accounts only for those who are compliant in the first place.The only way one can regulate and ensure people have rights is through legislation where their rights are spelt out and are put down in law, and people can have access to them and can litigate for them.On the litigation, what I particularly like about this Bill is that it speaks of a right to adjudication.  Many of these companies are small, do not have significant cashflow and simply do not have the ability to pay large legal fees.  Having the right to an adjudication - the real focus of developing law reform is alternative dispute resolution and dispute settling mechanisms - is important and to be commended.I am not sure the Government is focusing enough on the black economy and on business that is being done outside the law.  In speaking on the corporate donations aspect of the electoral reform Bill yesterday, I stated that one cannot legislate for a moral compass.  We can provide as many laws as we want to reduce donations but we cannot stop somebody pocketing money and not declaring it.  We are increasingly seeing, particularly in the construction sector, a move towards the black economy where people who were capable of operating in a more regulated environment are competing for work in such an aggressive manner with such strict competition that the black economy is growing.  Laws never apply to the black economy.  Considerable emphasis needs to be placed on the black economy which is estimated to cost the taxpayer €5 billion a year in lost revenue.  I am working on proposals in this regard about which I hope to speak to the relevant parties in Government.I commend Senator Feargal Quinn on his Bill.  In his opening speech in the Seanad he acknowledged the work of Mr. Seán Gallagher who approached him about it, and I commend Mr. Gallagher, too, on his input into the Bill.  It is a good example of a Private Members' Bill being used properly and constructively and being facilitated, and that is to be commended.  I will not get into the debate of my colleague on the worthiness of the Seanad except to say that this certainly shows the Seanad is capable of proposing excellent legislation, and I am delighted to support it.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on the Construction Contracts Bill 2010.  This has been a long time coming for many subcontractors, in my own county of Wicklow and throughout the country.Deputy Nolan is quite correct when he states we cannot fix the problems that have occurred but there is an onus on us in this House to put structures in place to prevent these problems recurring.  There is a tendency among those of us in politics to wax lyrical about the mistakes of the past, but this is a real example of forward-looking legislation.  It is making a genuine attempt to learn from what happened in the past and to send out a message to subcontractors that the Oireachtas is addressing this issue and that we want a degree of fair play to ensure people are paid for a fair day's work and a fair job done.As others have done, I place on record my gratitude, and that of many of my constituents who have been employed as subcontractors, to Senator Feargal Quinn for his commitment and dedication to this issue and for developing his own Bill on the issue.  I am pleased that Senator Quinn is in the House.  It is rare that politicians get such high praise as I have heard for him this afternoon from other politicians but it is a credit to his work and his credentials on this issue.  Indeed, I note that Senator Quinn was assisted Mr. Seán Gallagher, and it is important to acknowledge that as well.  I am pleased the Government has approached this in a constructive manner, taking on board Senator Quinn's Bill while also liaising with him and the Office of the Attorney General to ensure we have the most effective legislation possible.As the provisions of this Bill have been outlined by many Members and by the Minister of State during the course of the debate, I want to take the brief time available to me to put on the record the concerns which have been articulated to me by Wicklow subcontractors.  I would ask the Minister of State to ensure he is satisfied the provisions of this Bill address the challenges, obstacles and, at times, the downright abuse which have been experienced by the subcontractors with whom I have come in contact.  It is important we ensure in the process of Committee Stage that we have the best possible legislation.  There have been undoubtedly many examples over recent years, in my county and beyond, of large-scale contractors leaving the small guy or so-called subby high and dry, and endangering as a result not only that subcontractor's livelihood and business but also occasionally even his or her family home.What has been most galling for subcontractors - the State cannot merely point the figure at others - is that the State was complicit in this over the years.  We, as a State, allowed this to happen.  Often State agencies, Departments or local authorities paid the full sum owed to a contractor knowing all too well the subcontractors were not being paid.  Deputy Nolan and others spoke of the powerful role of some of these large contractors whereby it was almost the case they could walk in to any local authority and get a contract.  They were seen as the only show in town and scant regard was paid to the subcontractors who had been left high and dry.  The State turned a blind eye to large contractors failing to pay subcontractors for a job well done.The message I have received loudly and clearly from subcontractors in my constituency is they want to see change.  They want to see subcontractors listed in the main contract for a project.  They want to see sanctions and penalties for contractors who fail to fulfil their obligation to subcontractors so that one cannot have a situation where a contractor who fails in his obligations on one job is able to get another job from the local authority.  They want a system in place whereby a subcontractor must be paid within a set number of days of a contractor being paid an instalment for a project, and they want the State to ensure the next instalment is not forthcoming to the contractor until this is done.Quite importantly, the subcontractors want to see a ban on the practice of below-cost tendering.  We have seen a system - almost a culture - develop whereby contractors effectively bid below cost for a project.  Often, it is not the contractor who takes the financial hit, but rather the subcontractors and the range of other individuals carrying out element of the project further down the line.I have been informed by subcontractors that their industry is, effectively, paralysed with fear.  At a time when we are trying to grow the economy and get out of the way of business to let it get on with the job of creating jobs and wealth in this country, subcontractors are almost afraid to tender for work for fear they will be left holding the baby, so to speak, with overheads such as the cost of materials and fuel, and without a safety net.  This legislation attempts to introduce that safety net and I very much welcome it.I am satisfied that, from day one of Government, we have taken this issue seriously.  We have listened to the concerns of subcontractors, and in the programme for Government, we made a clear commitment to "introduce new legislation to protect all small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies"  Today and over the course of this debate we set about fulfilling that commitment.  The work done on this Bill by Government in consultation with Senator Quinn has been extensive, and it has involved researching how other jurisdictions deal with this and also consulting relevant industry and professional bodies.I welcome the clarification from the Minister during the course of this debate that the issue of financial thresholds will be examined again on Committee Stage.  That is important.  When we are introducing a Bill to protect the smaller guy, one does not want to leave out the much smaller guy.  Let us get this right once and for all.  One only gets one bite of the cherry.As a member of the Committee on Public Accounts, I have seen a situation which emerged during Celtic tiger Ireland whereby the price budgeted for a public project was very different from the price with which we ended up and the taxpayer took a huge hit on that.  It is important to place on the record of the House the considerable progress that has been made in trying to get public projects delivered on budget and on time.  Much credit must go to the officials in the various Departments and the work done by the Civil Service in this regard.With this Bill we are trying to introduce the protections and safety nets that are so badly required but at the same time limit the exposure of the taxpayer to cost and risk, while also recognising and not wanting to undo the considerable reforms that have been achieved for the taxpayer in public sector construction procurement.  It is estimated these reforms in the regime of public contracts has generated savings of €300 million per annum, which is a sizeable amount.I very much welcome the legislation and hope we can see this introduced into law as quickly as possible.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I welcome Senator Feargal Quinn to the Chamber.  I acknowledge and thank him for the work and effort over a long period of time that he has put into bringing this legislation before the House to be discussed today.  I welcome the opportunity and thank the Technical Group for allowing me some of its time to speak on this important Bill.  I also wish to acknowledge Mr. Seán Gallagher, who went to Senator Quinn in the early stages about this continuing problem.In case anybody thinks that because of the breakdown in the construction sector, this is not a problem today, it is a more confounded problem now than ever before for the following reasons.  There are people pricing jobs and making commitments to carry out work at unrealistic prices.  The only way they can meet their commitments is if someone is not paid.  I will cite an example of this ongoing practice in a public contract.People who worked on a school building project in Kenmare have not and will not be paid.  It is awful that subcontractors who supplied concrete, stone and aggregate for certain jobs and enabled projects to rise from the ground will never be paid.  I have been given permission to name one of the subcontractors in question in the House.  Timmy Harrington ran South West Concrete and was owed money by a subcontractor who is gone.  Mr. Harrington stopped producing concrete last Thursday and his business has closed at great loss to himself, his family and the excellent people who worked for him.  They no longer have employment because he was not paid for supplying concrete at a critical time in his business.Such cases should not be allowed to happen.  Where did the money come from to build the school in question?  It was provided by those who are working today, contributing to society and paying taxes.  The contractor got his money and when the subcontractor was paid, he did not fulfil his obligations.While I have great time for the Bill because it seeks to address a serious problem, I am concerned it does not go far enough.  It is wrong to impose a threshold of €200,000.  One contractor described the decision not to apply the provisions of the Bill to contracts for work valued at under €200,000 as problematic.  Subcontractors could be penalised for not finishing a project, even if they have not been paid.  I know of subcontractors who have moved overseas leaving many people high and dry.  If the legislation is passed without amending the threshold, people will not be offered full protection.  As far as I can discern, a subcontractor is protected where the contract is with the main contractor, whereas those who work for subcontractors remain extremely vulnerable.  Those who supply plasterers and block layers with concrete, stone and tarmacadam and hardware shops that provide goods for building works are at the end of the money chain.  When payment is not made, they are the first people to be left high and dry.It is unfortunate that Mr. Harrington had to cease producing concrete last week.  I am proud of every small business in my area.  They started with nothing, paid their taxes and other charges, and, like others operating small businesses, were crippled under an avalanche of paperwork and regulations.  Mr. Harrington employed people and worked hard.  It is ridiculous and wrong that he has not been paid for work he did on a project funded by the State.  It is the worst type of blackguardism in which anyone could engage.  What protection will be in place for those who provide goods and services to subcontractors as opposed to the main contractor?I will refer to another concern people have expressed.  There is a major difference between being competitive and tough when trying to secure a job and being unrealistic.  It is clear from the prices being charged for some jobs that the only way the project will be completed is if someone is not paid.  Hard-pressed small businesses respond positively to requests to supply stone or concrete and live in hope of being paid.  Unfortunately, payment is not made in many cases and I am concerned the Bill does not provide sufficient protection for smaller contractors.  While these people may be sole contractors who hire extra help when required or an employer of one, two, five or ten staff, they form the backbone of the economy and need to be protected.  I hope changes will be made to the €200,000 threshold.On the issue of personal guarantees, I must declare an interest as I am one of the contractors who have been burned over the years.  Personal guarantees have been shown to be worthless.  I have had personal dealings with many people who have been left in an awful position as a result of being unable to collect the money they are owed for work they have done.  Collecting what they are owed would keep their businesses solvent and allow them to overcome a hurdle until the next opportunity for work arises.  Unfortunately, many of them will be unable to do so.Are there irregularities in some of the relationships between main contractors and subcontractors?  Is there an understanding in some cases that the subcontractor will be paid first and others down the line will be burned?  Having studied the prices for jobs, I and others have concluded that something untoward is taking place.  This issue should be closely monitored because if people are winning State contracts with the intention of not paying people at the bottom rung of the ladder, it is a serious issue for the Government.  We must all be mindful of the possibility that this type of practice is taking place.I compliment the Taoiseach on confirming on a number of occasions, most recently in the past week or ten days, that notwithstanding other business before the House, this important legislation will be passed before the summer recess.  I commend the Government on treating the Bill with the urgency it deserves.  There is no point talking about arbitration if those who owe the money have hightailed it and caught enough people out to make it worth their while to run away to another country to work.  That is happening in many cases and it is impossible to bring them back for any process of arbitration, negotiation or mediation, with a view to settling outstanding debts because they are long gone.  This issue must be dealt with.I would like to raise the issue of those self-employed persons who, unfortunately, go out of business.  Some provision will have to be made for social welfare assistance from the State.  The people concerned have been gainfully employed for many years and often employed others.  They were fully tax compliant and always did everything correctly and all of a sudden they find themselves without work and with no money coming in.  Whatever savings they had have been spent.  They still have a house to run and their families to rear, but they are unable to receive any welfare payment.  In such cases, the people whom they employed are, thankfully, able to receive help from the State to live and look after their families, but those who employed them are not able to do so.  Since coming into this House over one year ago, I have consistently demanded that some provision be made to speed up mechanisms of payment for persons with C2 tax clearance certificates, who were self-employed and are now unable to find work and fund themselves.  All they want is assistance to keep them going.  We have to put measures in place to ensure they can receive welfare payments.  They paid enough taxes during the years and always did things correctly but now they find themselves left in the lurch which is an awful place to be.Senator Feargal Quinn's work in bringing forward the Bill certainly shows that the Seanad is capable of doing excellent work.  It is great to see a person of his calibre bringing forward a Bill in the first instance.  Where I come from, we sometimes see people in that House acting as glorified news correspondents, relaying news about the work of local county councillors and other public representatives and regurgitating it.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	235	If some people want to label themselves as correspondents and belong there rather than in public office, that is good for them, but it is welcome to see a worker coming into this House.  He has now left, but it is welcome that he was here to listen to the debate.  It is nice to see people doing what they are supposed to be doing.  I welcome the Senator's excellent work during the years and thank him for his contribution to political life on many other issues.My problem with the Bill is that we need to re-examine the €200,000 limit and think at all times of the small business operator.  I am not here to speak for the big contractors but for the small operators who have a van or truck and a couple of machines.  These are the people who are under severe threat and have built their businesses from an early age.  There is nothing worse for a person than to have worked hard all of his or her life and then to see it all crumble because others are not paying what they rightfully owe.  They are running off with that person's money.  That is what is happening.  It is robbery and blackguardism and should not be allowed to happen.  No Minister wants to see that carry-on.  Everybody in this House wants to see fair play for ordinary workers and if changes need to be made to the Bill and if the Minister can make them, I would really appreciate it.I do not want to see more small businesses go to the wall, as has happened in the last few years owing to unrealistic pricing and people going in below cost.  Below cost selling is not allowed in shops anymore; surely therefore there should be some provision whereby a person cannot price below cost for a project, particularly a public project.  This should not be allowed.  It does not make sense because somebody will not be paid.  If a contractor goes below the level of the cost of a job, somebody will be burned.  That usually happens towards the end.  The blocklayer or the person digging the foundations might be all right, but those coming in at the end of the job such as those who lay the tarmac are in grave danger.  God help the painter and the man who puts in the windows because they are some of the last in and will also be the last to be paid.  I hope tsome provisions can be made to ensure this will not happen anymore.  We want to protect small business operators and ensure they will be there for better days if they come; please God, they will.Mr. Harrington's business which went last Thursday is just an example of the businesses of all the small contractors around the country which are hurting.  Some provision will have to be put in place to look after contractors when they fall on hard times.  When they present before a community welfare officer to seek assistance, it is not good enough for the CWO to say they have a C2 form and that they cannot be given a payment.  I ask the Minister for Social Protection to ensure her Department works on this issue and come ups with something quickly to ensure a speedy payment to such persons who have worked very hard during the years and now find themselves on the opposite end of the spectrum.I thank all of those involved in this issue.  I would also like to go back to Mr. Seán Gallagher who went to Senator Feargal Quinn in the first instance with it.  The general election last year delayed passage of the Bill, but it is welcome that it is before us now and that we can make progress on it.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I spoke last night in the debate on the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011 when I made the point that I was always somewhat nervous when there was virtual unanimity on legislation.  I have looked at this Bill in its amended form, with the Minister's proposed amendments on Committee Stage.  On this occasion, and with few, if any, reservations, I rush to join the ranks of the masses in the context of supporting the legislation before the House.  In so doing, I acknowledge the role played by Senator Quinn, Mr. Seán Gallagher and the Upper House in the production of this Bill.  Very often, and I am sure it will be no different later today, the Seanad comes in for some criticism regarding the manner in which it goes about its business.  In the context of real reform, the way what began as a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad has wound its way through both Houses and attracted virtually unanimous support is a reflection of a mature parliament going about is business in a mature fashion.  We need more of that and fewer of the restrictions imposed by the Whip system.The Bill relates to the construction industry.  It is interesting to reflect on that industry in a broad sense.  In 2007 some 270,000 people were employed in the construction industry, whereas today the figure stands at approximately 100,000.  This represents a substantial collapse.  Given that in excess of 160,000 people lost their jobs, we must ask what is a sustainable construction industry in a mature economy.  I contend that the pendulum swung too far in the context of the correction which occurred and that there is scope to create sustainable jobs within the construction industry.  It is critical, however, that we should put in place the proper legislative framework to allow the industry to re-establish itself.It has been regrettable to watch the dismantling of the construction industry on television.  I refer here to reports relating to the sale and export of heavy plant and machinery to eastern Europe and elsewhere.  We must remember though that a critical aspect of re-establishing the industry relates to the human component, namely, those who comprise the skilled workforce.  All Members will have sat in the kitchens and living rooms of constituents who worked as block layers, plasterers, carpenters, electricians, general labourers, painters, window installers, etc. and witnessed the carnage that has been wrought.  Many of these people subcontracted in the absence of the safety net of a written contract and were left high and dry.  What the Bill involves is people learning lessons - perhaps after the horse has bolted in many instances - and putting in place some certainty about the manner in which those to whom I refer can go about their business in the future and be assured of receiving payment for the work they do.  Regrettably, many of the individuals in question have fallen foul of a system which has allowed main contractors prosper at their expense.  The law appears to be entirely skewed against their interests and in many respects the Bill tries to create a level playing pitch.One of the issues which is bedevilling the construction industry as it attempts to get back on a sustainable footing is the prevalence of the black economy.  That is a matter which the Government must address with some urgency.  I recently spoke to a small building contractor in my constituency who tendered for a job relating to a house extension.  Many people are deciding not to move to bigger homes but are rather upgrading their existing residences.  The man in question tendered for the job but he was beaten hands down by some individuals who are operating in the black economy and who are concurrently working and signing on.  There is an onus on the Government, through agencies such as the planning authorities and Revenue, to address the black economy in a sustained fashion in order that people who are paying their taxes and trying to survive in a very difficult environment will not be hounded out of business as a result of the State's inactivity in this area.We now have substantial control over the banks and we should oblige them to notify Revenue when someone who is funding extension or improvement works or a construction project by means of a bank loan draws down money.  In addition, a person who is extending his or her house should also be obliged to notify Revenue when work commences.  A simple obligation of the type to which I refer would put the fear of God into the sponsor of the project and anyone working on the site that if they were not tax compliant, if they were concurrently working and signing on or if their affairs were not in order, inspectors from the Department of Social Protection, Revenue or some other agency might come calling.  That is one way to proceed.  If the sponsors of projects were obliged to notify Revenue on commencement of work and if the banks were similarly obliged to issue notification when moneys were drawn down, that would go a long way towards addressing the issues to which I refer.Essentially, the real issue relating to subcontractors is that in many cases legal contracts were not in place.  The relationship between main contractors and subcontractors was not one of equals.  Subcontractors were very much at the receiving end when it came to terms and conditions.  This was despite the fact they did not have written contracts.  What is critical in respect of this legislation is that in the future the adjudication process, which is quick and affordable, must be binding.  I welcome the commitment the Minister made to the effect that it will be binding.  The fact the latter will be the case will not mean someone who is aggrieved by the outcome of the process will not have recourse to conciliation, arbitration or, ultimately, litigation.  The essential point is that the adjudication process will be binding.  In other words, people will pay now and argue the matter in court or elsewhere at a later date.  This will mean subcontractors will not be left high and dry.We must ask whether the notion of binding adjudication is sufficient.  As Deputy Healy-Rae observed, contracts are awarded to main contractors and the simple requirement on them is that they must have a tax clearance certificate to tender for work.  In itself, this can hardly be considered adequate any longer.  Main contractors should be obliged to display some financial muscle which demonstrates they are not merely winning contracts on the basis of tax clearance requirements.  When they do win contracts, these individuals or companies approach subcontractors and state they will take 20% off the top for themselves and the former can have the work on a subcontract basis for 80% of the original amount on offer.  We must examine the tender process and ensure the prices being charged are realistic and are not below cost.  We must also ensure main contractors are not in a position to drive a coach and four through the legislation and the intent behind it.I welcome the Minister's indication to the effect that thresholds will be removed, which is critical.  It was originally envisaged that thresholds of €200,000 and €50,000 would apply in respect of public and private contracts.  There are people who went out of business because they could not recoup amounts as low as €2,000 or €3,000.  This was particularly the case when credit from the banks was drying up and people could not obtain payment.  Effectively, the house of cards came down as a result.  The Government must consider the impact of the domino effect in this regard.  A subcontractor might have had two or three block layers, electricians or carpenters working for him.  By virtue of the PRSI contributions the former paid on their behalf, these individuals had the comfort of a safety net.  In other words, they qualified for jobseeker's benefit.  However, because they paid a different class of PRSI contributions, subcontractors were effectively left swinging in the wind.  Their contributions were only of use to them in terms of pension entitlement on retirement.I return to my initial point.  We must ensure we have available to us the people required to kick-start the construction sector when the opportunity arises and when the time is right.  Many people were so badly burnt that they either emigrated or dismantled the capacity of their businesses.  One of the reasons they did so was they felt they had been badly burned by the social welfare system when they needed a leg up.  The entitlement of self-employed subcontractors to pay a higher rate of PRSI contribution on a voluntary basis needs to be looked at.I welcome the Bill.  I particularly welcome the collaborative approach that is at its heart, the involvement of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the improvements that have been engineered so far.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and I am pleased to support the Bill.  Like previous speakers, I recognise the tenacity of Senator Feargal Quinn in proposing the Bill in the current and previous Seanad.  I also acknowledge the work of Mr. Seán Gallagher in bringing forward the Bill.The Minister of State has said he will be introducing amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  I welcome this approach and hope we will see more Bills introduced in this way.  Like previous speakers, I particularly welcome the changes made to the thresholds for contracts to be covered by the Bill.  This makes sense.The Bill reinforces a basic principle of business and commerce, that one is paid for materials supplied and work done.  The very idea that we have to legislate to solve this problem is not logical.  A contract is a contract and my word is my word.  In the last decade this was, unfortunately, not the case.I understand many businesses ceased trading or closed down because their debtors had failed to pay them.  This had knock-on effects and caused the closure of other businesses because of their inability to pay their debts.  There was a domino effect.  The failure of just one business can have a domino effect on other businesses and the employment of hundreds, if not, thousands.I am sadly and acutely aware of subcontractors who took their own lives after the failure of developers to pay their contracted costs.  This contrasts with reports on certain developers and major contractors toasting the creation of NAMA with champagne in Marbella.The need for the Bill is perplexing.  It is strange that we must protect a certain sector within the construction industry.  Why do we not have a Bill to cover every supplier of goods and services in all sectors?  The construction sector must look at itself.  We must differentiate between major developers, on the one hand, and contractors, builders and small family firms, on the other.  We tend to think all contractors are the same, but this is not so.  We must look back at the development of the construction sector between 1997 and 2007 when the Government, led by Fianna Fáil, took control of the nation when it was on a rising tide.  Even the highest tide cannot prevent a ship from running aground if the captain and officers are sipping champagne down below.  The close connection between government and the building industry is one of the major reasons the Bill needs to be enacted.In the 1980s the construction sector was largely made up of small family firms which had operated honourably for generations.  The change came in the 1990s, which was one of the worst and saddest periods in the history of the country.  The prospect of instant profits and doubling one's money overnight attracted people with few or no morals.  What was revealed at tribunals, particularly the Mahon tribunal, was merely the tip of the iceberg.  We saw the ostentatious lifestyle of those involved in the construction sector.  Racecourses became like air traffic control centres as they dealt with helicopters which now patrol the Grand Canyon for our tourists who visit such places.  It is a pity the people concerned did not keep their feet on the ground when they felt it was more appropriate to be high fliers, leaving subcontractors, for whom we must now legislate, high and dry.  A new generation of developers was spawned in the Galway tent and moral standards and behaviour slipped accordingly.  Those who were attracted by super profits left much to be desired.  This is one of the reasons we must legislate to protect the smallest and most vulnerable in the sector.I hope the Bill is the first step in reforming the construction sector, in which proper regulation and legislation is required.  The time is right to get rid of those with the Del Boy mentality which has led us to the current sorry situation in the sector and the economy.Honest, genuine, competent and hard working contractors need not be concerned about the legislation.  We already regulate taxi drivers, publicans, driving instructors, architects and others.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to bring people who are tempted to enter the black economy into a more regulated sector.  Those who are competent and genuine have nothing to fear.  We do not want to see another Priory Hall.  We have enough of them to deal with and will have more in the coming months and years.  These difficulties were not caused by contractors but by developers who got others to do the work for them and then refused to pay them.I welcome the legislation and thank Senator Feargal Quinn and Members of the Seanad for introducing the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government for bringing it to this point.

I also thank all those who worked on the Bill which addresses the problem of non-payment in a balanced manner to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory costs.  The Bill has been introduced because of the situation in which we find ourselves because of the antics in the Galway tent and some of our banking leaders such as the management of Anglo Irish Bank and various others.  There are many casualties, including small subcontractors and construction workers.  In the last four or five years 160,000 construction workers have found themselves out of work.  The boys who sipped champagne ran the country because there was no political leadership and we are now in a very difficult situation where the Bill is necessary.I welcome the Bill.  The casualties include ordinary individuals who bought houses and are now in negative equity, people who are out of work and those whose sons and daughters do not have a future in the country.  The Government must ensure they will have a future here.  The current situation was brought about by greed and recklessness.  The Government and elected politicians forgot who was in control and allowed light touch regulation of those who spent €550 per room in Poznan.  Those days are over.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I welcome the Bill.  I was a Member of the Seanad when Senator Feargal Quinn introduced it.  The manner in which he introduced it and brought it to this point is an example of how politics should be conducted.  When the Bill reaches Committee Stage, I hope the Minister will accept amendments, from either side of the House, in a generous fashion.  It reflects a bipartisan way of implementing important legislation.  I would like to see that spirit maintained throughout the entire passage of the Bill.In the last number of months I have had extensive dealings with a family in my constituency who have been brought to the brink of personal ruin by the absence of legislation such as this.  This is a vivid and human illustration for me of the huge damage done to families and our society when we do not have legislation to ensure an industry is conducted in the correct manner.My third point on the industry is that it is vital that the construction sector redevelop and that it be kick-started.  Those who talk about the future of the economy are sometimes guilty of imagining that we can have an economy that does not include a sizeable and growing construction sector.  We must have it back again.  It will not be at the level it was at in the past, but, equally, it will not stay as it is.  We can get to a mid-point and the legislation will, I hope, create an environment within which that can happen.The amendments the Minister of State indicated he would introduce are crucial in terms of implementation of the Bill.  The first issue he highlighted is vital, namely, the need to examine, or perhaps remove altogether, the monetary thresholds contained in the Bill because the people of whom I am conscious in the debate are not the large players or the big companies which have the ability to hire people to represent them but those who do not have access to any of this – the small players who must be recognised by the Bill.  The amendment the Minister of State seeks to introduce in this regard is crucial.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I thank all colleagues for their contributions on the Bill.  We have had a substantial debate in the course of the past two months.  In excess of 40 or 50 colleagues spoke in the debate.  There is urgency, however, in putting the legislation on the Statute Book because it was first mooted by my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, in the previous Seanad more than 16 months ago.  We have done a lot of talking about it and there is now a need to get it in place.  That is the crucial part of what we are trying to do.It is fair to say there is cross-party support for the Bill.  Given the fact that it remains a Private Members' Bill, I have made it clear from the start that it is in the ownership of Senator Feargal Quinn, it just happens to be in my charge in this House.  We have gone through a thorough examination of the issues in the regulatory impact statement.  In that assessment I was privileged to bring Opposition speakers and all of the construction industry together under the one roof, as it were, around the same table to tease out many of the issues that they thought required amendment in the original draft.  I made a commitment at the outset of Second Stage, which I repeat, that we will introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage which will greatly improve the operation of the Bill, not least on the issue of thresholds and the length of time involved in terms of the right of individuals to move off-site, as it were, if they consider their contract is not being upheld.  We will also examine how suppliers can be incorporated into the Bill.I have heard comments from all sides about those who produce products who find they are not being paid.  They are also part of the supply chain and there is a fundamental issue of fairness that must be shown to them also.  It is a difficult issue to resolve, but I am committed to doing so.  We have also given a firm commitment that the adjudication process will be robust, fair and come down clearly in favour of subcontractors, all of whom have been left in a difficult position.  The entire objective of the exercise is to be fair.I was very impressed to see in the United Kingdom the adaptation of its adjudication system that had been in place for some years.  It works well.  In the great majority of cases there is a result and people get back to work and are paid over a period.  The crucial responsibility we, as legislators, have is to put in place robust legislation that will allow for the current situation and what will happen in the future.Deputy Paschal Donohoe has made the point that we will not always have a construction industry accounting for approximately 6% of GDP.  That is not the position in any modern economy.  We should have a construction industry which accounts for approximately 10% of GDP, but, equally, it is unsustainable to have a construction industry which accounts for 20% of GDP.  That situation will not return any day soon, nor should we want it to.  Therefore, we must plan for the future and put in place a sustainable construction industry with correct rules that will apply to everyone and in which there is fairness.  In the great majority of construction cases people do not enter into contracts.  That is the case, principally in the private sector, but there are also examples in the public sector.  We must ensure the contracts in place are adhered to in order to achieve a swift resolution of disputes when the time comes.The task we face, having concluded Second Stage, is to quickly take Committee Stage so as to introduce the Government amendments I have mentioned and seek the support of colleagues at the select committee and on Report Stage in the House.  It is an ambitious timescale.  We do not know when the Bill will be returned to the Seanad, but we have a responsibility to the entire industry to ensure we can move the Bill along as soon as we possibly can and in a manner which has cross-party support.I very much appreciate the support we have obtained for the Bill from the Opposition parties with which I have worked in developing some of the ideas behind the amendments.  I look forward to receiving their support.  I am open to the production of additional amendments from all sides which will strengthen the legislation.  This is a piece of work which has come from both Houses, from an Opposition Senator, as it were, and we have a responsibility to ensure the bipartisan approach applies on Committee and Report Stages.  I will not be found wanting in that regard.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	246	We Independents are often told that the country could not function without political parties because they draft manifestos and position papers before elections, yet they are frequently criticised for breaking their promises.  Those of us who publicly stated that we would commit an act of civil disobedience by not paying the household charge have been criticised by those on the Government side.Regarding a property tax, Fine Gael's "Less Waste Lower Taxes Stronger Growth" document and its election manifesto state:Fianna Fail's proposal, now endorsed by the Labour Party, to introduce by 2014 an annual, recurring residential property tax on the family home is unfair for three reasons:• The initial flat rate charge means that owners of houses in standard neighbourhoods will pay as much as the owners of mansions.• It will be difficult to pay for asset-rich but income poor households, particularly the elderly and the unemployed; and• It will be deeply unfair for a young generation that paid exorbitant amounts of stamp duty and VAT on the purchases on over-valued houses, many of whom now find themselves in negative equity.One could add to the last category people in pyrite homes and those who do not own property, namely, people who are in so much negative equity that all they own are debts.The household charge was not introduced to collect €100, but to create a database of people's names, addresses and PPS numbers so as to allow for the collection of a property tax next year.  I stated as much when the House debated the legislation.One of my main problems with this tax is that we do not have a local government system.  Rather, we have a system of local administration.  In Denmark, extensive services are delivered at local level and democratically controlled.  Had we such a system and if the amount of money levied could be controlled, an argument could be made for funding services locally.  However, we are far from that system.This forms part of my reason for refusing to pay the household charge and for standing in solidarity with others who are doing likewise, as I stated during the debate on the legislation.  This will remain a valid response until a justifiable system is in place.  The charge as imposed is not justified and the Minister was correct when he told the House that it was unfair.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute on this Bill, which is a clear attempt to do something positive about an unjust tax on homes.  I welcome and support the legislation and commend Sinn Féin on introducing it.The Bill is clear and comprises three sections.  There can be no dithering on the main issue - one is either for or against a home tax.  It is not a tax on wealth or property. This is the crucial issue.  It is time the Government admitted its mistake.  It is not good enough that senior Ministers, for example, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, are running around Brazil while people are being penalised at home for the actions of others.Let me challenge the Taoiseach on some of his comments yesterday to Deputy Boyd Barrett, whom he lectured on breaking the law.  Let us examine the State's history.  Since its foundation, 40 Oireachtas Members have been arrested and imprisoned for breaking the law on issues about which they felt strongly.  My good friend and colleague, Deputy Durkan, was jailed in the 1980s for protesting in support of farmers.  The late Tony Gregory went to Mountjoy Prison because of his protest on behalf of this city's street traders.  There is a proud tradition of defending the Molly Malones.  Given these examples, we will take lectures from no one about legislators breaking the law.I have already paid my tax - I paid stamp duty when I moved house.  Many families have already paid central government thousands of euro in taxes.  The Government wants people to pay tax for local government services three times.  The public pays for these services through taxation everyday.  Households pay for the fire brigade service, septic tank charges and management fees.  Water charges will be added to that list soon.  This is the real world, yet the Government wants the same households to pay an additional household charge.I welcomed Deputy Stanley's comments last night.  Not only did he complain about the charge and introduce the legislation, but he also suggested progressive ideas on funding central government through taxation.  I strongly support the suggestion to introduce a third rate of tax of 48% on individuals' earnings above €100,000, which would accrue €410 million to the State.  Group relief is availed of by companies that transfer losses to profitable companies to write down tax receipts.  Its abolition would accrue in the region of €450.3 million.  Abolishing legacy property reliefs would raise €341.8 million.  A 1% wealth tax, which we in this country seem to be against, would accrue approximately €900 million.  These are solutions to the question of funding local government services.  The Opposition is not just introducing legislation to withdraw the household charge.  We are suggesting solutions to the problem.  For this reason, many members of the public listen to what is being stated.I supported the second home levy, as it was a direct tax on people with extra houses.Consider examples of good practice in other European countries.  In Denmark, councils receive a portion of the corporation taxes raised in their respective areas.  In Norway, there is a local wealth tax on natural resources.  We are not examining such ideas because we are too conservative and afraid and our Government is asleep.  In Spain, there is a local tax on development land.  When the land's value increases, a percentage of its value goes to the local authority.  These are sensible solutions.It is important that we realise the difficulty the household charge causes many families.  They are feeling the squeeze, paying many taxes and are suffering.  Many people are losing their jobs and small business are going down the tubes due to the pressure.  It is for the Government to assist these families and to kick-start the economy, yet the household charge's introduction has damaged the fight back.  During the referendum campaign, we discussed growth and developing the economy, but taking €100 and more out of people's pockets is killing the economy, as they would otherwise have spent that money in their local small businesses and shops.I support this commonsensical legislation.  It is important that the Taoiseach, the Minister and the House listen to constructive proposals on local government funding.  Such proposals have been made during this debate.  Of course we must fund local government.  I sat on Dublin City Council for five years and understand the reality of the situation.  We also have a priority to put forward sensible taxation proposals.  This legislation is part of the fight-back and part of trying to kick-start the economy.  I strongly support this Bill.

In published media reports, it is top of the class in compliance with paying the household charge despite one of its Deputies advocating non-payment.  To be specific, 76.3% of households in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown paid which can be positively compared to the national average of 56%.  Why should my neighbour pay for the local services, facilities and grant money while others do not pay their fair share?  Without a doubt, the people of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown have shown a keen sense of civic spirit and decent responsibility.My constituents also have to go out to work, pay mortgages, stamp duty, higher child care costs and higher parking and transport costs.  Mortgages in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown are very high with modest three-bedroom and four-bedroom semi-detached houses selling in the Celtic tiger era for between €500,000 and €700,000.  Many of these home owners are under significant financial burdens but still paid their household charge.  To be fair, many of them also have to pay for their children's education due to the shortage of places in State schools in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown.In the interests of my constituents, I am demanding that those who pay the most receive the most.  There are several councils where less than 50% of registered houses have paid the charge.  My constituents should not suffer for those other councils' lack of legal compliance.  The implementation of a household charge is not a radical, extremist or new age move by the Government.  Such a charge, or a variant of one, is in operation in many countries such as France, Germany, Greece and Italy.  It might be a surprise to some, given that Sinn Féin introduced this Bill, but a household charge, in fact quite a burdensome one, is in operation in Northern Ireland.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	258	In the past two months the Sinn Féin Party has performed more stunts than Evel Knievel.  From doctoring quotes from respected academics to last-minute publicity hungry court actions to this Bill tonight, it appears there is a common thread.  We are using valuable Dáil time on a Bill that does not deserve to be called legislation.  To call this piece of paper legislation gives this House a bad name.  This, like many recent antics from Sinn Féin in this Chamber and beyond is about the next leaflet drop, campaign and opinion poll.  The absence of any genuine political engagement on the issue of the charge exposes the complete and utter paucity of Sinn Féin policy on this and other critical matters of social and economic importance.There is a grand deception at the heart of this approach.  Sinn Féin puts party before country and to hell with the consequences.  This Bill is Sinn Féin at its self-indulgent worst.  The streak of toxic dishonesty that it brings to the debate pollutes and poisons the political atmosphere.  It simply does everyone a disservice.  Sinn Féin would rather play on people's fears than work with them for a better future.  Its quest for power reminds me of the dog that chases the car - he would not know what to do with one if he caught it.  On some occasions, the dog is so focused on catching the car, he eventually gets run over.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	260	The Sinn Féin Party does not come to this debate with clean hands either.  Few believe its rhetoric on the household charge in this State when it demands on average the equivalent of €1,500 per household in the North.  Is this not evidence of a partitionist mentality?  Deputy Stanley should front up.  His MLAs and councillors in the North are happy to suck over £1,000 out of three-bed semis in Newry and spend the money with vigour.I also noted Deputy Stanley wondered aloud last night about what James Connolly might think of the Labour Party today.  There are too many people on that side of the House who have an unhealthy interest in what James Connolly is doing in his grave.  I suggest, however, the founder of the Labour Party could tell the difference between a bunch of power hungry populists and a party focused on giving the people back their self-respect and dignity.  It is the toughest set of circumstances any Government in the history of State has inherited.  The party of Connolly has maintained social welfare rates, restored the minimum wage and removed 330,000 people from the grip of the universal social charge.  It does not posture, pontificate and sanctimoniously lecture everyone.  It does not tell them there are easy options when there patently are not.I recognise the difficulties imposed by this interim charging system.  If we did not, we would be blind and stupid.  I look forward to the Sinn Féin Party and Mahatma Boyd Barrett ditching their cynicism and proving their socialist credentials in joining in the support for moves towards a progressive, fair and equitable property taxation system in the future, away from flat charges.  It is fair to say, however, we will not be holding our breath on that.

However, introducing new taxes for any parliamentarian must be done in a responsible manner.  Like all Deputies, I do not like burdening our citizens with extra taxes.  Many who now support the Opposition may not thank the Government for introducing the household charge.  However, future generations will look back at this time when the country is in an unprecedented economic crisis and thank the Government for taking hard but responsible decisions which sustained us.  In the past, this country became totally dependent on unsustainable tax receipts from a property bubble which are no longer available to us.  These tax receipts were funding public services for which alternative money must be found now.  This country needs a sustainable revenue stream to fund local authorities and services.Rather than being populist and political point-scoring like the Opposition, we should be looking for solutions rather than problems.  It is not good to have legislators who are encouraging citizens to break the law.  Where will those legislators be when the chickens come home to roost when penalties and increased charges will apply?  They will probably be running for the hills at that stage.Sinn Féin, in presenting this Bill, is speaking out of both sides of its mouth.  As other Members pointed out earlier, the fact is it is prepared to charge an average of €1,000 per household in the North of Ireland for domestic rates.

They are happy to spend the charges on local services because they know they are needed.  However, its representatives in this Parliament say the complete opposite.  The citizens will see through this eventually but the sooner the better.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I want to add my voice to those of my Government colleagues who are opposing this legislation.  I speak to highlight some of the inaccuracies I have heard, particularly in some of last night's debate, from the proposers of this legislation.As Deputy Coffey pointed out, nobody in the Government wants a position where new charges or higher taxes must be paid, but the country finds itself in an unprecedented place.  We have never been anywhere near this before and our Government is charged with taking serious decisions with a view to balancing the books and righting our economy.  It was clear at the time of the election and subsequently that the memorandum of understanding entered into by the previous Government with the troika included the establishment of a property-based taxation system.Sinn Féin and some of the Independent Members who spoke in support of this legislation are the only socialists I have met in the world who speak to oppose a tax on property.  I am not a socialist, although I am not particularly happy about the prospect of imposing taxation such as this.  Nevertheless, it is part of the legacy inherited by this Government and we will not be rewarded in future, as a Government, if we do not address the difficult position our economy is in.  That is why I support my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in introducing this particularly difficult legislation.I agree with Deputy Coffey in his criticism of this notion - which seems to have become acceptable - that legislators would go around the country advocating the breaking of laws just because they argue that a specific law is unjust.  If a political movement loses an argument, a vote in this House or an election, it does not mean it has the right to declare a law democratically enacted by a parliament as unjust.  It does not bear examination to say this law is unjust.  The Opposition has lost the argument on the need to balance the books in this economy and that is why this measure has been introduced.In my part of the world, in south Kilkenny, the Sinn Féin Party is organising a series of public meetings in places it did not know existed until quite recently seeking extra funding for local services, which I find appalling.  This is at a time when the party is calling on the public not to pay a tax which goes to providing those local services.  It is crucial for the people who have paid this charge that those who have not yet contributed would be made do so.  I have been struck by the number of members of the public who are not particularly happy about the household charge but who have paid it and who are adamant it should be collected from everybody.  It is important this comes about.

The large head was in control of the northern area, imposing cuts and higher rates on the people.

The body of Sinn Féin will one day have one head instead of two, and the party will scare Little Red Riding Hood.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	276	We live in extraordinarily difficult economic times.  We now require clear political thinking and difficult decisions to restore economic sovereignty, fix the banking system and get public finances under control.  It is not long ago that this country was in a position similar to where Greece is now.  At that time we had utter political chaos on top of economic instability, and for the last weeks of the previous Administration, we were a rudderless ship that was frightening to behold.  In the 2011 election, everybody knew the state of the country's economic fortunes and was aware of the difficult decisions required.  Although such issues will be difficult, I hope they will be fair.We can consider a number of measures taken up to now.  The Government has restored the minimum wage, introducing a baseline earning per hour for every man, woman and young adult in the country.  It has removed 330,000 people from having to pay the universal social charge, increased mortgage interest relief and reconstructed joint labour committees following a ruling by the superior courts of this land.  The Government maintained basic rates of social welfare and income tax levels in the first budget.  It also managed to renegotiate two aspects of the deal with the troika, namely, the terms of the bailout and the promissory notes.  In the 15 or 16 months this Government has been in office, it has taken several measures of note to protect the lower paid and those who felt the brunt of the economic collapse in this country.Nobody wants to introduce a tax but this is in the memorandum of understanding.  We are required to do so by the troika which is paying our bills.  It should be borne in mind we are borrowing millions every month to fund essential public services, and that is before we even consider banking debt.  That is the prison from which this Government is viewing the economic position, and its hands are therefore tied.  None the less, I outlined a number of areas where it has protected the most vulnerable people.It is incumbent on every Member in this House and each political grouping to produce proactive and constructive policies that could help us get out of the mess we are in.  I congratulate Sinn Féin on having the brass neck to produce this Bill.  In the North the party is working with the DUP to bring about savage austerity, and we can compare that with its utterances here about a Government that is proactive in working to get us out of the hole we are in.  It is sheer hypocrisy.  This is a €100 household charge.  The time in the House this evening would be better spent debating a full and equitable property tax and making proposals which the Government can use.The late Jim Kemmy always said the moral high ground was a lonely place and since February last year we have seen Sinn Féin take the moral high ground on one issue after another.  A number of motions were passed at its recent conference.  Motion No. 66 read: "This Ard Fheis calls on the Ard Chomhairle to draw up strict guidelines for all Sinn Féin public representatives with regard to the use of taxpayers money and the drawing down of expenses to ensure consistency of conduct across the party and maintain our credibility with the public".  Reading this morning's edition of the Irish Independent for five minutes would put paid to that lie.  Misappropriating taxpayers’ money to fund a political operation flies in the face of this motion.  It is utter hypocrisy.  About £500,000 has been drawn down from the British Exchequer to fund a political operation in this country, while maintaining an abstentionist policy at Westminster.  This smacks of hypocrisy and plays to people’s fears, taking advantage of the misery they are experiencing.  When people get up in the morning and wonder about the next utility bill or mortgage payment and then look at the difficult decisions being made by the Government, what do they see when they look at the Opposition?  The answer is political hypocrisy and pious political platitudes.  Sinn Féin does nothing but debase the reputation of politics.  That is why politics has been besmirched to such a level because of sheer political cynicism at huge cost to the ordinary hard-pressed individual and at greater cost to the reputation of the body politic.
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	277	There is no party in this House that has a monopoly of wisdom in terms of what the people are suffering.  Everyone in the House knows the terrible state the country is in and the difficult circumstances faced by people in their everyday lives.  Every discussion, be it on television, radio or in the newspapers, is about the debt crisis in Europe, the slowing down of the world economy, the deficit crisis in this country given that we are borrowing €44 million a day or the implications and ramifications of the EU-IMF bailout programme.  I listened to the five speeches made by Sinn Féin Members yesterday and they did not mention any of these topics once.  The basic political and economic scenario facing the country has been ignored in Sinn Féin's Local Government (Household Charge)(Repeal) Bill.  The circumstances I have outlined are directly impacting on the country and dictating the decisions that must be made to balance the books.  They are not popular or easy, but they must be made.  The five Deputies in question, Deputies Stanley, Ó Caoláin, Mac Lochlainn, Colreavy and McDonald, took no time to mention any of these issues when they came here to lecture us on taxation and economic policy.Deputy Stanley has said politics is about making the right decisions, not the easy ones, and improving quality of life for ordinary people on low and middle incomes and that trading on empty truths does not pay bills, create jobs or strengthen communities.  This comes from Sinn Féin which 16 months ago ran an election campaign in which it stated we did not need the EU-IMF deal and could survive on our own.  It claimed the National Pension Reserve Fund could be used to fund services.  I do not know how many times it has spent it by now; it must have been spent six times over in the last 16 months.  Sinn Féin wanted to default, but it also wanted to borrow.  It wanted the banks to collapse but lending to flow.  It had every sort of populist economic fantasy.  The truth is its economic policies have no credibility and there is no substance to them, except short-term political gain.Deputy Stanley has also said to Labour Party backbenchers that the members of the public who elected them are sick to the back teeth of hearing that things could be worse, that they could not be worse for families.  My own personal view as a Labour Party backbencher, because we are separate parties with separate ideologies in a coalition, is that a Fine Gael Government would not have reversed the cut in the minimum wage.  I have talked to Deputies and there was definite consternation about it.

This means Sinn Féin is proposing that nearly half of residential property owners who have no mortgage or mortgage arrears and are not in negative equity should not pay a property tax.  That is not to raise the question of those who acquired properties for investment purposes.The Labour Party in government is committed to having progressive income and property taxes.  We know what Sinn Féin's views are on the household charge, but what are its views on progressive property taxes?  To date, it has avoided the challenge of answering that question, adopting a St. Augustine of Hippo position of "Lord, please give me property taxes, just not yet."  Surely it must acknowledge the difference between a person buying a home under the tenant purchase scheme as in my parish of Ballyphehane and a person buying the vacant palace owned by the late Charles Haughey.  I seriously call on it to withdraw this nonsensical Bill and, failing that, on every serious left-wing Member of the House to vote against it.

Deputy Gilmore promised "Frankfurt's way or Labour's way".  Angela Merkel's way has stepped forward.At the end of the day, we have policies rather than the fairytales the Government has made up.  The legislation attempts to reverse this unfair tax.  People who deal with poverty every day of the week are saying the Government has made the situation worse for people on low and middle incomes.  The Government has mishandled the introduction of the tax and it will not alleviate the suffering people are experiencing.  It will not help people in local authority areas who want more services.  The Government parties need to ask themselves what are the alternatives.  Sinn Féin has suggested alternatives.

The household charge imposes the greatest percentage loss on those on low incomes, according to the ESRI.  How can the Government and, in particular, our comrades in the Labour Party justify a tax, which ordinary people with meagre incomes are expected to pay on the same basis as millionaires?  That is unfair.  People ask me why they should have to pay the same as millionaires.  Why should an elderly person or someone on social welfare have to pay for people who ripped off this country and created the mess?  That is where the anger is coming from among ordinary people and that is why they will not pay the charge.  One only has to look at the number of law abiding, decent people who say there is no way they will pay this.  That took a great deal of courage and we should recognise that.  The Labour Party does not have a monopoly on what is right and wrong in this House.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, called the household charge "a very narrow part" of the Government's programme but this is incorrect.  It represents an important part of what the Government parties are about, which is sneakily attempting to make ordinary people pay more than their fair share for the bailout process Fianna Fáil started and they are happy to continue.  This charge, which Ministers earning €170,000 a year are so eager to claim is paltry or nominal, is not about helping to fund local services or any other services; it is about fulfilling the deal struck with the ECB and the IMF.  The final part of this section of the agreement requires the implementation of a full property tax.  The rumour is that this will be taken from PAYE workers' wages in the same way the Government threatened people to pay the household charge or face the Minister for Justice and Equality's dreaded attachment orders, which were aimed at old age pensioners and other social welfare claimants, something the Labour Party and others said they totally opposed.The household charge is a ham-fisted gimmick which fails miserably to take into account the differences between those who have a barely manageable mortgage for two-bedroom apartments in Santry, Finglas and Ballymun and those who own their Killiney mansions outright.  Sinn Féin opposed this charge and made its arguments against it clear from the outset.  It is an unfair flat rate charge, which will not benefit the people who pay it or the public services they and other residents of the State rely on.  The Taoiseach joked and made light of the cost of the charge by saying it amounted to "less then €2 a week" but, as is par for the course, this was a serious distortion of the facts and a great example of his completely removed position from ordinary people.  The charge cannot be paid in weekly instalments and it was to be paid within a set period or those liable would face late fines.  Many opposed the charge on principle and not because of an inability to pay but, for some, the ability to spare €100 and pay the Government in one lump sum as if they were not struggling to keep their heads above water and as if their fair share has not been paid was too much for their bank balances and their stomachs.In their hundreds and thousands, people rejected this charge.  I called for the House to reconvene the week after the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis to put this Bill into action, having recognised the abject failure of the Government to convince the people of the legitimacy of this charge.  My call fell on deaf ears, as did the calls of thousands of people who surrounded the venue of the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  The leading Government party even closed the blinds unable to bear the sight of a people no longer willing to put up with this.  The Government is intent on making the ordinary person pay repeatedly for services he or she is increasingly not receiving in order that the State can meet its nonsensical commitments to Europe through taxation and a plethora of charges based on its failure to plan a proper taxation system and provide services efficiently where needed.Deputies Nash and Coffey barked at Sinn Féin about the North, pretending to care for the first time since partition about how the people of the Six Counties are faring under the Stormont Executive.  Unfortunately, Stormont does not have fiscal powers and the Government has done little to help change that but I am glad the rates paid by the residents of the Six Counties are frozen at an average of €866 a year.

I hope this allays the fears of the Minister of State's colleagues about the plight of the people of Northern Ireland and I also hope their relief is used to focus better on providing progressive solutions to our financial problems and not solutions that begin and end with the people who can afford it the least paying the most.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	307	During the debate, my colleagues have described in great detail the impact the household charge will have on low and middle income families.  Not only is this flat rate charge unfair, it will make life demonstrably harder for many thousands of families struggling to make ends meet.  I am sure the Minister of State must be aware from her constituency clinics of these people to whom I refer.  However, I would like to focus on a different aspect of the household charge, namely its impact on the domestic economy, jobs and our prospects for economic recovery.  This week, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance said their economic strategy - if one could call it that - is on track.  They say GDP growth returned in 2011, GDP projections for 2012 remain on track and unemployment is stabilising.  Unfortunately for the Government, the hard facts tell a different story.  The last two quarters of 2011 saw a return to negative growth in GDP.  In other words, the State is officially back in recession.  In fact, the domestic economy, where most of the jobs are, has not been out of recession in the past five years and GNP continues to contract at an alarming pace.  Unemployment has not stabilised, with the latest Central Statistics Office quarterly household survey showing that 14.8% of the labour force are out of work.  Meanwhile, the ESRI report published this week forecasts that unemployment will continue to rise this year.  These figures do not include the tens of thousands of people - many of them young - who, faced with a State that has utterly failed them, are emigrating in search of work.These hard facts confirm what people across the State are experiencing every single day, week and month, namely, unemployment, emigration, financial stress and real human hardship.  Contrary to the Government's claims that the economy has turned a corner, the reality is that we are in the grip of an economic, unemployment and emigration crisis.  In the midst of these overlapping crises, what is the response of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government?  Their great plan is to take more money out of the pockets of hard-pressed families in the form of VAT hikes, petrol and diesel tax increases and the household charge.  These taxes and charges not only push families into ever greater levels of financial hardship but also damage the domestic economy.  Every euro the Government takes out of the pocket of a low or middle-income family is a euro taken out of the domestic economy.  It is a euro not spent on local goods and services, with the result that more struggling businesses lose trade and are forced to lay of staff.  This leads to more unemployment, more emigration, less tax revenue and increased social welfare expenditure.In my constituency of Donegal South-West - I cannot be sure it will remain as such after the boundary commission has had its say - the impact of the Government's failed approach can be seen every day.  It is there in the classrooms where dozens of the primary teachers who finish work this week will not be allowed to return in September because of the Government's policy of attacking rural schools and the children seeking to be educated in them.  It can be seen in the closure of Garda stations in rural areas throughout the county and the threat to the district headquarters in the Glenties areas.  Policy failures are clear to see in the pending closure of Lifford Community Hospital, whose patients the Government wants to evict as it has done to other vulnerable people in other counties.  The Government's ineptitude can be seen in the bed closures in Letterkenny General Hospital that are inevitable unless the Government allows the recruitment moratorium to be lifted and provides additional funding for their retention.

We have tabled motions in almost every city, county and town council in opposition to it, many of which have been passed with the support of members of the Minister of State's party.  Those representatives seem to be far more in touch with reality than their colleagues in the Labour Party living inside the Oireachtas bubble.  Moreover, rather than merely stating our opposition to the charge, we have taken action to seek its repeal.  The Bill brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Brian Stanley, seeks to reverse the disgraceful measure the Government imposed on ordinary citizens.Some have questioned why we have not actively called on citizens to boycott the charge.  We have not done so because people do not need politicians to preach to them.  They have had enough of that from the Government.  People are intelligent enough to make informed decisions for themselves, just as I have made an informed personal decision not to pay the household charge.  Many people throughout the State have taken the same decision for the same reasons, namely, that it is an unfair and unjust tax.I do not buy into the argument put forward by this Government that the household charge is necessary to fund local services.  During my ten years as a member of Cork City Council I listened to members of the Labour Party complaining about the cuts in local government funding that were imposed by the Fianna Fáil Party in government.  Yet, in its first budget upon assuming office, the Labour Party did precisely what its local representatives had been complaining about for a decade in regard to Fianna Fáil by cutting the local government fund by more than what this charge would bring in even if every eligible householder paid it.Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, sought to justify the obligation on him, as a member of Government, to introduce unfair and unjust taxes such as this.  One of the excuses offered was, "The troika made us do it".  The troika also stipulated that the Government must bring forward legislation to deal with personal debt, but that Bill has not yet been published.

The Government picks and chooses which troika Bills it wants to draft and implement as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, referred to our position on rates in the North and he tried to use that as another reason to impose the household charge.  It is quite clear he has no confidence in his own position.  We are very confident in regard to what we are trying to achieve in the Six Counties, namely, to regain fiscal powers, to try to regain sovereignty for the 32 counties and to act in the interests of the citizens of this island, North and South, and not in the interests of the troika, which is what the Government is doing.In regard to the Government's bully boy tactics, we heard a letter will be sent to every household which has refused to pay this charge.  It should save itself the cost of a stamp and not send one to me because I will not be paying this unfair and unjust charge.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I commend Teachta Brian Stanley on bringing forward this repeal Bill.  We all know - the Government even admits it itself - the household charge has been a disaster for all those citizens burdened with paying it and for this Government which has stubbornly insisted on imposing it.  It should be scrapped.  Everybody makes mistakes and the Government should simply scrap this charge and introduce fairer and more equitable measures to raise the finance needed to fund local government.Thus far, the household charge has fallen far short of the €100 million it was expected to raise.  At the same time, almost 50% of households are still refusing to pay.  Many are refusing to pay because they cannot afford to do so.  The charge is so obviously unjust that many ordinary citizens who would never think of breaking the law have decided to take a stand and refuse to pay.  It is also acknowledged that many of those who have paid have done so under duress and the fear of legal sanction.This household charge is flawed and it is a failed tax.  It punishes citizens for the failure of Government and the greed of bankers, developers and corrupt politicians.  It targets the disadvantaged and those on low and middle incomes who are struggling to make ends meet.  I have seen this throughout the State - I attended many of the meetings some of my colleagues spoke about - and in my constituency of County Louth and east Meath.  Working people are carrying the burden for the debt of corrupt politicians, speculative financiers and bankers.What is the Government to do?  Will it take everyone to court?  Will it deduct payment at source causing more poverty?  Will it run scare campaigns to frighten citizens into paying?  All of this is costly and divisive and is evidence of the failure of the austerity strategy and what has been happening for the past 12 months.

We made an alternative budget submission but the Government has failed to introduce practical and effective job creation and growth strategies to get people back to work and get the economy growing.Despite its refusal to stand up to the big people, it is prepared to impose all of these new taxes and charges on those who can least afford to pay for them.  I have only been in the House for a year but I see Labour Party Ministers carrying the can in this Chamber for Fine Gael.  I see that time and again.  Where is the Minister, Deputy Hogan, tonight?

It could introduce a third tax band of 48% on earnings over €100,000, which would bring in €410 million in a fair and progressive way.  These are just two examples.The household charge has been rejected by the people.  As I said, the Government should move to scrap the charge and reimburse those who have paid.  I urge all Deputies to examine this issue, recognise the deep hurt this policy is causing, accept there are more socially equitable means of raising local government funding and support this Bill.

How can they defend the indefensible, because that is what everyone on that side of the House is trying to do?  It is an absolute disgrace.Deputy Griffin, the Minister of State and I know people in our constituencies who cannot put food on the table.  I have a letter, which was sent to Deputy Adams's office and which was sent to the Taoiseach, from people who were unable to pay their mortgage or feed their children.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul had to intervene to help them.  These people are being forced to pay the €100 charge.The Minister of State is an absolute disgrace.  She is supposed to be a socialist and protect the legacy of James Connolly, but she has disgraced it.  The Labour Party promised everything and said it would not be Frankfurt's way but the Labour Party's way.  We now know the Labour Party's way.  It is to penalise the poor and victimise the people most repressed in our society.  It is an absolute disgrace.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	349	We sat in this Chamber last night and tonight and listened to the posturing of Sinn Féin and others on a Bill which is irresponsible, ill-thought out and ideologically bankrupt.  Sinn Féin and others want to repeal recently enacted legislation which has, to date, raised €94.5 million.  I did not hear one of them tell me where else we would get that money.  These funds enable the continuation of essential local services and ensure we are moving towards placing the funding of local authorities on a stable and sustainable financial footing.Introducing a charge in 2012 is part of the agreement to which Ireland is committed with the troika and it will be replaced next year by a progressive property tax.  I hope the Deputies will support that but I will not hold my breath.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 is a vital funding element of public services at local level.  The income from that goes towards the upkeep of streets, the maintenance of parks, playgrounds and green areas, the lighting of towns and villages, and the continuation of library services and many more amenities and facilities that people take for granted.  Sinn Féin obviously believes these services to communities are unnecessary as it wants to remove the funding stream that enables their provision.  Sinn Féin is a party that positions itself to the left on the political spectrum, yet believes an Act that introduces a charge of €100 on the ownership of property - an amount that is by international standards relatively minimal and falls far short of the €800 or more that people living on the Falls Road in Belfast pay under a Sinn Féin Administration - should be repealed.  It believes legislation that requires those who own property to contribute towards local services in their area, services that everybody, including the poorest, can enjoy, is inappropriate and should be removed from our Statute Book.  It appears that Sinn Féin is losing touch with the realities of everyday life for those who need those very services, in addition to ignoring the urgency of having funding in place that guarantees services.  This is politics at its most irresponsible.  It is nothing more than a cheap, populist exercise on Sinn Féin's part.The charge is an interim measure and was always intended to be so.  The Government has always been clear on this and on its intention to introduce a full value-based property tax in due course.  Designing, legislating for and implementing a comprehensive value-based property tax takes time.  The household charge measure is preferable to the alternative of rushing through a poorly designed or badly implemented property tax to meet the troika's timeframe.  It is a measure to ensure local authorities have the resources necessary to continue to deliver services to their communities while the option for a value-based property tax is given full consideration.  In this regard, an interdepartmental expert group was established in February to consider the structures and modalities of a full property tax.  The group has recently submitted its report to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The approach to the report will be considered by the Government in due course.Many of the comments last night and tonight were framed as if the Government were unaware of or unconcerned by equity issues.  This is simply not the case.  It is precisely because of these issues that the Government is taking the time required to ensure the full property tax, when introduced, will be as equitable and fair as possible.  It is for this very reason we introduced the household charge as an interim measure.  Equity is an important element of the terms of reference of the expert interdepartmental group.  In the context of the property tax framework, the Government will ensure the issue of fairness and the implications for personal circumstances, income levels and property values are given full consideration.  We will not take any lectures from Sinn Féin in that regard.When imposing the €100 charge, the Government was very concerned with fairness.  In this regard, we ensured a number of exemptions and waivers were included in the legislation.  There is a balance in that the exemptions and waivers must be targeted at those who genuinely need them while ensuring the overall charge is kept as low as possible.  The Government has been successful in this regard.  More than 17,200 people have registered for waivers to date.  The charge of €100 is low by international and Northern Ireland standards.  I am satisfied that many of the most vulnerable groups in society are either exempted or entitled to a waiver from the charge.  In addition to the inclusion of exemptions, provision was made for payment by instalment.Last night, Deputies stated the majority of people have not paid the charge, and they have repeated this tonight.  As of 15 June, just under 960,000 residential properties, or 60% of estimated liable properties, had been registered.  As stated, €94.5 million has been raised.  This is recognition by the broad majority of the population that the charge is necessary to enable the provision of local services and meet our obligations under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, which commits us to a property tax.We all know too well now that our economy, especially our tax revenue, was overly reliant on activity in the construction sector.  The decline in the yield from transaction taxes such as stamp duty, capital gains tax and value added tax on property generally has been a major factor in the imbalance in the public finances.  We are spending more than we are raising.  The necessary correction is sharp and difficult, as we acknowledge.  Unfortunately, more needs to be done over the coming years.  The introduction of the €100 household charge on residential property is one of the measures that must be taken, reflecting the EU-IMF support programme to close the gap between expenditure and revenue.  However, as my colleagues emphasised last night, it should be seen as more than simply a measure to raise revenue.  It is a structural change to the State's revenue-raising system and forms the platform on which to base the full value-based property tax in due course.The Bill proposed by Sinn Féin is wrong.  The repeal of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 would leave a hole in the public finances, putting us in breach of the EU-IMF programme.  It would mean basic local services would be discontinued and our attempts to place local government funding on a sustainable footing and to move away from the volatility of the revenue-raising measures favoured by our predecessors would come to naught.  It would mean we would have learned very little from the recent economic crisis and would have failed to grasp the need for a sea-change in respect of how we raise revenue to provide basic necessities for our citizens.  The Government cares about the financial legacy it leaves to the next generation and that is why I urge the House to reject this Bill.  It would be great if we could hear some positive proposals from Sinn Féin occasionally.

At all these meetings, I noted people who are genuinely worried and terrified.  They are terrified about the €100 charge.  The Government told them they had to pay €100 but that the charge would not be €100 again.  It will not tell them what the next charge will be, although it will be more than €100.

There are old people struggling on low incomes and husbands and wives who were both working a couple of years ago but who now have absolutely no work.  The latter are living on welfare and trying to pay back massive mortgages.  On top of that, they will be hit with the property tax, which they believe is unfair because it is treating struggling families in the same way as multi-millionaires with big mansions.  That cannot be and is not right.  This is why it makes sense to vote tonight.I have listened to the debate since 7.30 p.m.  Members on the Government side have attacked Members on this side and suggested they are not entitled to come in here and introduce a Private Members' Bill.  Of course there are entitled to do so.  They are elected and Sinn Féin is entitled, as a party, to introduce a Private Members' Bill.  It is wrong for people to criticise the party for doing so.  If the very people that were attacking Sinn Féin tonight had been at the public meetings, attended by 500, 700 or 1,000 people, and had been told the people believed what the Government was doing was unfair, they would certainly not be looking down their noses at the Members who introduced the Private Members' Bill tonight.  They would be saying the Members are elected to make their case.There are people watching what is happening this evening.  They are listening to what Members have to say about the €100 charge.  There are those who are genuinely terrified as to what the charge will be in the future.  They wonder whether they will be able to pay and what they will have to sacrifice to come up with the fee.  These people have been hit hard, they are vulnerable and are at a very low time in their lives.  There are struggling to send young children to school and educate them in the best way they can.  They are trying to maintain a certain standard of living for them and to keep food on the table.To be sneering and laughing at the Bill tonight is wrong and disrespectful to people outside the House.  The day on which one treats people with disrespect is a bad day for politics and the politicians involved.  They should not be looking down on anybody.  I am concerned about the people affected and I am grateful for having had the opportunity to speak.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I commend my colleague, Deputy Stanley, on bringing it before the House.  I concur with some of the sentiments of Deputy Healy-Rae, who made a great deal of sense.Sinn Féin has consistently opposed the household charge since its introduction in December 2011 and has done so for a number of reasons.  First, it is our belief that the charge is fundamentally unfair in that it fails to differentiate between those on low incomes and the rich.  Simply put, the household charge penalises hard-pressed middle class families, the working poor and those on social welfare while the wealthy and affluent avoid paying their just share.  Where is the fairness in expecting a single man in receipt of €188 on invalidity pension to pay the same as someone earning €100,000 or more?  It is just not fair.  The household charge is a product of the Government's decision to cut funding to local authorities.  This funding was then redirected for other purposes.The Fine Gael-Labour Government had, of course, other options and it could have raised the €160 million needed for local authorities in a variety of ways.  For example, it could have capped public service pay at €100,000, increased taxes on high earners and introduced a wealth tax.  The Government could have made a determined effort to improve its collection of commercial water rates, 48% of which still remain uncollected.  However, it made a conscious and ill-conceived decision to penalise ordinary people, a significant proportion of whom are already struggling to survive.In my constituency of Cork East, I am, unfortunately, all too familiar with the difficulties people face as a result of this charge.  For example, one of my constituents, a 55 year old man with special needs, was so terrified and frightened by the charge that he came to my constituency office seeking assistance.  Although in receipt of invalidity benefit of €188, this gentleman was still expected to pay the €100 household charge as he lived alone in a small house left to him by his recently deceased mother.Another of my constituents, a full-time carer was also very concerned about where she was going to find the extra money to pay this additional tax.  This woman, like so many others, was living on a carer's allowance of €188 a week and already finding it difficult to make ends meet.  Surely this, and other examples, highlight the inherently unjust nature of the household charge.Indeed, this charge is so essentially flawed and unjust that it should be scrapped.  Ordinary people throughout Ireland are aware of this fact as are significant sections of the trade union movement, community groups and civil society.  The Government's blinkered approach to this issue as evidenced by its refusal to look for alternative sources of funding, coupled with ongoing threats to cut essential local services, is yet another chapter in the politics of fear.  The Labour Party's willingness to be an active participant in implementing this and other charges, and the speed with which it betrayed those who voted for it at the last general election, is evidence, as if it were needed, of how out of touch the Government is with ordinary people.Sinn Féin is committed to building a fair, just and more equitable society.  The Local Government (Household Charge)(Repeal) Bill 2012 is an attempt to begin this process.  With this in mind, I would urge Opposition and, indeed, Government Members to support this Bill and repeal the household charge.

They claimed it is forced on Irish people, not by the Government but by the troika.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan and I know that is simply not true.  The troika, of which I am not a defender, never dictated that there had to be a household charge, nor did it dictate how it should be imposed.  Did the Government ask for it to be removed?  When the Government met the troika shortly after last year's election, it did not demand that any reference to a property tax be removed because it supports a charge on people's homes.  The truth is the Minister of State is using the troika as a smokescreen behind which to hide and dragging the Labour Party along with her.Sinn Féin agrees that local government needs to be properly and adequately funded.  Sinn Féin will continue to put forward fully costed options, as we have over recent nights.

These proposals would not increase the burden on low and middle income PAYE worker or those in receipt of welfare.The Government's contribution has been a charge that does the opposite.  It penalises those who are already feeling the burden of five austerity budgets.  It forces the lone parent further into poverty.  It forces families to decide between bills and food, and we all have heard those stories.  The charge is fundamentally flawed and any analysis would bring one to that conclusion.It is sheer arrogance that the Government could not even see to allowing for waivers.  It did not allow us last December the opportunity-----

It does not even have a veneer of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  If one cannot pay, one faces the full rigours of the law.  Ordinary law-abiding citizens who do not pay or who cannot afford to pay face the trauma of being dragged through the courts and facing a fine of up to €2,500.  If one cannot afford the household charge of €100, one is criminalised and faces fines of €2,500.  This make no sense.  At the current level of non-payment, which, according to the Government figures, is at 43% in my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, the Government will have to drag hundreds of thousands of citizens to court, prosecute them and fine them for the sake of €100.

Legislative provisions relating to moneylending are contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 (as amended) and the offences are set out in Part VIII of that Act.  Persons who engage in moneylending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act, which provides for a prohibition on engaging in the business of moneylending without a licence.  Complaints may be made to the Gardaí who have power to bring prosecutions against unlicensed operators.A person who is guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to  a fine not exceeding €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.The powers of An Garda Síochána in tackling illegal moneylending are principally contained in sections 105 to 109 of the Act, which make provision for a number of matters including Garda powers of entry and arrest.   I am informed by the Garda authorities that where offences under section 98 are reported to An Garda Síochána, the matters will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local District Officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.   There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, sections 10 (harassment) and 11 (demands for payment of debt causing alarm) of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which specifies offences of blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces.I have had enquiries made with the Courts Service and I am informed that there is no record of a successful prosecution for illegal money lending over the past 7 years.  There were 91 charges brought in relation to harassment under section 10 of the 1997 Act but it should be noted this offence has wider application and there is no information available about whether those cases related to moneylending activities.  I would encourage all those with specific information concerning the operation of unlicensed moneylenders to make that information available to An Garda Síochána who I am assured will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.

It is therefore not possible for me to say how many members will be assigned to the stations in question in the coming year.I have been informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Finglas and Ballymun Garda Stations on 31 May 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 120 and 111 respectively.  In addition to these figures, there were 3 Garda Civilians and 14 Garda Reserves attached to Finglas Garda Station and 12 Garda Civilians and 11 Garda Reserves attached to Ballymun Garda Station.  I am circulating with this answer a table containing the detailed information requested by the Deputy on the personnel strength of both stations at the end of each year from 2011 back to 2006.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The majority of failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants including persons refused entry into the State, persons who are removed as a result of being made subject to a Deportation Order, persons who were transferred under the Dublin Regulation to the EU member state in which they first applied for asylum and EU nationals who were returned to their countries of origin on foot of an EU Removal Order are removed using scheduled commercial flights as appropriate.  As there have been approximately 10,000 such persons removed overall in the period in question, it is not possible to give details of the cost, destination and number of persons removed on each such individual scheduled commercial flight.It should be noted that approximately 90% of these removals related to persons refused leave to land in the State. To put it in context, tens of millions people entered the State in the period in question. In the great majority of the refusals of leave to land cases, any costs arising are borne by the carrier.  Removals on foot of Deportation Orders which are carried out using commercial flights usually involve transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return. In addition, most flights have to be booked at short notice, near to the date of departure, which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance.The remainder of failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants who are made subject to Deportation Orders are removed by charter flights contracted by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS). These flights are usually organised in conjunction with other EU Member States through FRONTEX (the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union). In most cases, such joint charter operations which Ireland has participated in during the period in question are partially or fully funded through the FRONTEX budget.The details of the number of persons returned and costs per charter flight for each of the years in question are set out in the table beneath. In many cases, where Ireland participates in a FRONTEX-organised flight which is led by another EU member State, Ireland will only have to charter a plane one-way to the European city where the FRONTEX charter is departing from. After the return of the FRONTEX flight to the other European city following the return of the deportees, the Garda escorts will return to Ireland on scheduled commercial flights.On occasions Ireland has been the lead country on flights and has had responsibility for the cost of the aircraft from Ireland to the country of return and back to Ireland. This cost which is substantially higher than chartering a plane to a European city also includes the provision of an airline crew, ground support at the airports for baggage handling, provision of food to returnees and escorts and also the provision of a medical team on the flight. In addition, some flights are fully funded by FRONTEX, while others, such as flights organised under the European Return Fund are only entitled to a partial refund.In considering the costs of the removal of failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who are the subject of deportation or removal orders has to be taken into account.  These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs, and detention costs in certain cases.  While it is important to keep deportation and removal costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system.  This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers.Finally, Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort. The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.CostDestinationNumbers Removed€118,690.86Nigeria310*Nigeria25€76,167.25Nigeria9€104,216.14Nigeria30€8,503.42Nigeria12€224,750.00Nigeria44€273,948.12Nigeria41€35,205.22Georgia1€1,654.60Georgia5CostDestinationNumbers Removed€7,492.89Nigeria220*Nigeria21€11,140.67Nigeria11€234,674.00Nigeria210*Nigeria280*Nigeria21€277,634.30Nigeria37€85,963.54Georgia38€54,746.50Italy2€25,086.88DR Congo1CostsDestinationNumbers Removed0*Nigeria39€108,990.38Nigeria19€35,505.05Nigeria17€9,364.13Georgia10€14,408.85Pakistan13€3,540.47DR Congo3€27,632.67DR Congo / Nigeria10CostsDestinationNumbers Removed€1,642.78Nigeria1€59,183.94Nigeria21€54,036.30Nigeria12€44,595.00Georgia7€25,886.00Ghana8

I have been informed by the Garda authorities that such property is managed under a dedicated property management system which is designed to facilitate the safe custody of the property.  In that context specific regulations and requirements have been put in place which operate from the taking possession of the property through to its final disposal.  Within this framework each property item is logged and tracked.  The Garda authorities have also indicated that a monthly reconciliation of property records is carried out at each Garda station.  In addition, senior Garda managers undertake the task of ensuring that the relevant policies and procedures are fully complied with.The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and money realised from the sale of unclaimed or seized property is accounted for as an Appropriation-in-Aid within the Garda Vote.  These funds are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Garda Internal Audit Section also audits all monies received by An Garda Síochána by way of Appropriations-in-Aid.  The Garda authorities have also confirmed that the current arrangements for handling unclaimed, seized or recovered property are operating satisfactorily and that they will be kept under on-going review.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I am very conscious that, notwithstanding the fact that public order offences decreased by 10.8% during 2011, anti-social behaviour causes great distress and the Programme for Government underscores our commitment to address this problem.  The Garda Síochána Policing Plan for 2012 includes as key actions measures to reduce public disorder and criminal damage including:identified locations,continue  proactive responses to public disorder including identifying anti-social behaviour ‘hot spots' and deploying appropriate resources to d liaison with the licensed trade and those involved in the management of the night time economy,improving the feeling of safety in the community through the deployment of targeted high visibility patrols.These strategies are supported by the Garda National Model of Community Policing and by local Garda management configuring policing responses to local conditions.  Clear objectives are set by Garda management, such as high visibility in the community and ease of contact by members of the public. Enhanced engagement is promoted with partnership approaches to improving community safety and reducing anti-social behaviour such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.  The Joint Policing Committees and Local Policing Fora provide a further mechanism whereby An Garda Síochána, the local authority, together with elected and community representatives can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of an area, including how best anti-social behaviour can be addressed.An Garda Síochána uses a range of legislative provisions in order to address anti-social behaviour and public order incidents when they occur, including of course the bringing of prosecutions where appropriate.  These include provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts which give Gardaí powers to deal with street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  Powers include the seizure of alcohol to prevent underage drinking in public places and to forestall public disorder or damage to property.  Gardaí may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  These are a more efficient use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings when an offender pays the penalty.Persons who engage in anti-social behaviour may also be subject to the incremental procedures under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  For children, these include a Garda warning, a good behaviour contract, referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.In addition to keeping the existing range of measures and policies under general review, later this year I intend to publish a White Paper on Crime, incorporating a National Anti-Crime Strategy.  The Strategy will act as a overall framework strategy within which all measures to tackle crime, including anti-social behaviour, will be drawn together and which will assist in planning and coordinating the work of all relevant agencies to enhance the safety of our communities into the future.

This is a very lengthy and complex Bill from a legal standpoint, with proposed provisions which do not currently exist in Irish law. While it was hoped that the Bill would be published by 30 April, work on its development is still proceeding in the context of the many submissions received on the Bill which include, the report of the Joint Oireachtas Justice Committee received in early March following their completion of hearings on the Bill.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is important that the provisions of the Bill are legally robust.  This requires careful legal drafting of the text and full consideration of issues which emerge during the drafting process.The troika team was in Dublin in April and progress on the Bill was discussed with them. They are supportive of the provisions contained in the General Scheme of Bill which I published on 25 January last along with my colleague the Minister for Finance.  They appreciate the complexities involved in drafting a Bill of this nature and understand that some additional time is required to finalise the text in preparation for publication.  I expect that the Bill will be one of the matters for discussion with the Troika in the context of their next quarterly review in early July.I can assure the Deputy that the Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the revised time frame for publication of the Bill is now the end of June with the strong intention to commence Second stage in the Dáil prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The great majority of subsidiary protection applications are from persons who have already been refused refugee status following consideration of their asylum claim by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  Each application for subsidiary protection is examined in my Department under S.I. 518 of 2006 European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations.  In the great majority of cases decided upon in my Department it has been determined that applicants have not been eligible for subsidiary protection for reasons such as their account of previous harm lacking credibility, country of origin information from reputable sources is at odds with the applicant's claimed fear of serious harm and the availability of State protection in the country of origin of the applicant among others.For the avoidance of any doubt, I should also state that every application for subsidiary protection is subject to a detailed assessment in accordance with the law and in accordance to the extensive jurisprudence that has developed in this area both here and internationally.  In many of these cases, this detailed assessment can be up to 60 pages in length.  Moreover, in making decisions on applications for subsidiary protection, the findings made in the asylum process are, of course, taken into account.  As the Deputy will know, the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 will provide for refugee status and subsidiary protection applications to be decided in a single procedure.  It is my intention to republish the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 later this year.

The system was launched by myself and the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána on 25 May, 2012, International Missing Children Day.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been no Alerts initiated in the short period since its launch.CRI Alerts may only be initiated by an Assistant Commissioner of An Garda Síochána and only when the following criteria are met:1. The child is under the age of eighteen years;2. There is a reasonable belief that the child has been abducted;3. There is a reasonable belief that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child;4. There is sufficient information available to enable the public to assist An Garda Síochána in locating the child.I am further informed by the Garda authorities to date in 2012 (to 14 June) eight incidents of alleged child abductions have been reported to An Garda Síochána, one of which transpired to be an attempted abduction of the child, who was not taken or harmed.  In five of the incidents the children were recovered safe and well and investigations are ongoing in the remaining two incidents, which relate to parental abductions, where it is suspected the children concerned are in the company of a parent and have been removed from this jurisdiction.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I wish to inform the Deputy that the Irish Youth Justice Service operates as a joint task force staffed by officials from my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I have retained responsibility for the diversion and community aspects of the work of the Irish Youth Justice Service, while my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has taken responsibility for the rest of IYJS, including the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown.Essentially the delivery of restorative justice approaches are primarily a matter for IYJS strategic partners — An Garda Síochána and the Young Persons Division of the Probation Service.  Restorative justice in the context of youth crime was introduced on a statutory basis for the first time in the Children Act 2001.  There are two restorative justice initiatives provided for in the Act: a restorative conference or restorative caution included in the Garda Diversion Programme and a court-ordered restorative justice family conference delivered through the Probation Service.An Garda Síochána are using Restorative Justice processes in the delivery of the Diversion Programme under Part IV of the Children Act, 2001.  Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers are trained as Restorative Justice Practitioners and in Mediation Skills.  More recently, Restorative Justice Philosophy has been introduced to five Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are managed by the Irish Youth Justice Service and operate on the basis of a strategic partnership between IYJS, An Garda Síochána and community based organisations.  In October 2011, Garda Restorative Justice Trainers provided facilitator skills training in Restorative Justice to 10 Youth Justice Workers working in Garda Youth Diversion Projects and to 4 Community Gardaí who as part of their brief liaise with the projects on a regular basis.  IYJS is monitoring the impact of these latest developments and the results will be taken on board in considering future developments in this area.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons provides a mechanism whereby prisoners can be repatriated to their home state in order to serve prison sentences they have incurred abroad.  The Convention is provided for in legislation in this State by virtue of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997, and the process is administered by my Department.  In the period 1995 to 2011 approximately 140 Irish citizens were transferred to Ireland from abroad to serve their sentence here and a similar number of foreign prisoners were returned to their home country abroad to serve their sentence there.  The Convention does not envisage the serving of any minimum term in the sentencing country before a prisoner is eligible for transfer.In this particular case, I had approved the transfer of the person referred to in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.  However, on becoming aware of the family's concerns, I decided to defer the transfer and subsequently met with the family.  I am giving careful consideration to their views and will make my decision in due course.As regards the procedures in place for informing families of victims, or victims themselves, the position is that when victims of crime request, the Prison Service Victim Liaison Officer will enter into direct contact with them, on an ongoing basis, to inform them of significant developments in the management of the perpetrator's sentence as well as any impending release.  The Victim Liaison Officer will also provide victims with general information on the prison system such as the prison regime, remission on sentences and the operation of the Parole Board.   It is important to note that this is a voluntary service.  It is for the victim, or an immediate family member in the case of a person who has died as a result of a crime, to choose if they wish to obtain information about a prisoner.  In this particular case, the family had not opted into the scheme.  However, as I indicated to them, I am going to make changes to the prison victim liaison scheme to provide for a more proactive system.

I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there is currently a Garda CCTV system in operation in Finglas and that the question of extending the system is being considered.  This is a matter which will be pursued in the light of the overall policing arrangements for Finglas and the availability of resources.

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region East Garda Division on 28 February 2011, 31 January 2012 and 31 May 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the table hereunder.Station28/02/1131/01/1231/05/12Blackrock (District F)989191Dundrum757371Stepaside302828Cabinteely393736Dalkey313129Dun Laoghaire (District W)10810498Kill — O — Grange292827Shankill595856Total469450436The Division is supported by 15 Garda Reserves and 23 civilians who provide administrative and technical support to members of the Garda Síochána.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	390	The functions and powers of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) are set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which provides for a Committee in each local authority area.  The Act provides that JPCs operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The current guidelines were issued in September, 2008.In relation to the report referred to by the Deputy, I assume he is referring to the outcome of the review of the operation of JPCs which I have previously mentioned in the Dáil. My Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and An Garda Síochána have commenced work on the review and have canvassed opinions from existing JPC members.  It is intended that a document will shortly be prepared, on the basis of which consultations will take place with the local authorities and other stakeholders. Elected members of the Oireachtas and of local authorities will be invited to contribute to this process.With regard to the allocation of resources for the Louth JPC, or any other JPC, the position is that each agency involved in the Committees is expected to meet the expenses arising for itself from within its own budget. It is important to bear in mind that JPCs are a forum for engagement to promote more effective action by the various stakeholders and are not an additional administrative structure.

His murder was not only a dreadful tragedy but also a shameful crime against this State.  The Deputy may wish to note that the case is currently being examined by An Garda Síochána's Serious Crime Review Team. I am informed that members of the Team have met with the Fallon family and continue to keep them appraised of developments where this matter is  concerned. In that regard, it is anticipated that a preliminary assessment of the case will be completed by September 2012.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be best to allow that examination to proceed.

Any proposals for the closure of Garda stations or the altering of Regional or Divisional boundaries must be set out in the plan. The Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been prepared and therefore it is not possible to say at this stage what it may contain although I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	394	Information regarding the number of searches involving the removal of clothing that have taken place in Bellmullet Garda Station since the incident in question took place on 31 March 2011, as compared to the number that took place there prior to it, is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to attempt to extrapolate. Garda management have informed me that they are not aware of any increase in such searches in the station referred to.As I mentioned in my reply to a similar question on 8 May last, the searching of a person in custody is governed by the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987 and 2006.  Members of the Garda Síochána who fail to observe any provision of the regulations are liable to disciplinary proceedings and members of the public, who believe they have been mistreated, are entitled to make a complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 131 together.The Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.   All prisoners are eligible to apply for such courses and the Prison Service will endeavour to facilitate as many prisoners as possible.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point, prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.As part of its recently published Three-Year Strategic Plan, the Prison Service will build on and enhance current programmes and services including accredited education and vocational training.  A new Incentivised Regimes Policy will also be rolled out which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.My replies to previous Questions explained the criteria which applies including the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account.  Regular review meetings take place in each of our prisons where the Governor, senior management, and representatives from the professional therapeutic services discuss individual cases and make recommendations to an official from Prison Service Headquarters as to how the sentence management of a case should proceed.  This may at times include a recommendation that the person engage in the school, work with the addiction services, etc but may also at times recommend that a prisoner be considered for a transfer from a closed prison, that they be considered for daily temporary release to attend a training programme or at times that they be granted supervised reviewable temporary release.Prisoners serving short sentences, i.e. under 12 months, may be moved to an open centre shortly after committal. Other longer term prisoners being prepared for the transition back into the community may be considered for moves with about 2 years left in their sentence.  Exceptional prisoners who are engaging strongly with the therapeutic services can sometimes be considered for a transfer with up to 4 years left to serve in their sentence.  For prisoners serving sentences in excess of 8 years, recommendations on their sentence management which may include transfers to open centres or temporary release are made to me by the Parole Board.  It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive a transfer to an Open Centre or temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect.The Deputy will appreciate that in all cases where prisoners have applied for a transfer to an open centre, early or compassionate release, or other concessions, there are safety, security, operational and logistical considerations that must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve or refuse the application. There is no automatic entitlement to concessions for prisoners at a specific point in their sentence or in light of specific conduct.  Each case is examined on its individual merits.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Audio Visual CCTV systems have been installed in 4 Garda Stations, namely Letterkenny Station in Donegal and Pearse Street, Store Street and the Bridewell Prisoner Custody area in Dublin.  CCTV systems are due to be installed this year in a further 15 Garda Stations , namely Irishtown, Ballymun, Finglas,  Lucan, Ronanstown, Carrickmacross, Ballymote, Buncrana, Navan, Leixlip, Castlerea, Tralee, Ballincollig, Castleisland and Listowel.  These CCTV systems cover public areas and custody areas in stations but cameras are not yet located in cells due to privacy issues which have to be resolved.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 130 together.There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years.  The problem of prison overcrowding therefore remains a challenging issue which unfortunately cannot be resolved overnight.Given the current number of prisoners in custody — 4,493 on 14th June 2012 — the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of less than 3,000 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety.It must be borne in mind that prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity. Family members, friends and co-accused prisoners often elect or are assigned a shared cell. Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm. There will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.On the 30th April I launched the Irish Prison Service 3-Year Strategic Plan for the period 2012-2015. In accordance with this Strategy, it is the intention of the Irish Prison Service, over the coming three years, to seek to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.The Inspector of Prisons recommended capacity for individual prisons is based on single cell occupancy in cells of 7m2 with in cell sanitation and an additional 4m2 for each additional prisoner  — for example double cell occupancy in an 11m2  cell, triple cell occupancy in a 15m2   cell.  It is also the intention of the Irish Prison Service, during the lifetime of the Strategy, to provide in cell sanitation in all remaining areas of the prison estate.  The attached table outlines the number of prisoners per cell in each prison and place of detention for the week ending 17 June, 2012.EstablishmentNumber of cells/ rooms with 1 person onlyNumber of cells/ rooms with 2 persons onlyNumber of cells/ rooms with 3 persons onlyNumber of cells/ rooms with 4 persons onlyNumber of cells/ rooms with more than 4 personsHighest Number of Prisoners in 1 cell / room / dormitoryArbour Hill87264003Castlerea*1249916404Cloverhill5735772004Cork379613003Limerick103944003Loughan House*64170002Midlands26314151715Mountjoy Female*49303215Mountjoy Male25313622604Portlaoise153603003St. Patrick’s Institution105580002Shelton Abbey*4131658Training Unit70260002Wheatfield1882630002*Mountjoy Female, Loughan House, Shelton Abbey and "The Grove" area of Castlerea Prison comprise of dormitory style accommodation with a variety of room sizes.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I can inform the Deputy that a new system for firearms licensing commenced on the 1st of August, 2009 with the commencement of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  This radically changed the manner in which firearms are now licensed in the State.  Included in these changes was the introduction of three year Firearm Certificates, with a standard fee of €80 for 3 years, and the outsourcing by the Garda of the collection of fees to An Post.  The table below shows the number of Firearm Certificates issued for the years 2009/2010, 2011, and to date in 2012 (up to 11/06/12).   The figures for 2009 and 2010 are combined as new, three year certificates were issued from August 2009 onwards.YearFirearm Certificates Issued1 August 2009 to 31 December 2010187,445January to December 201130,716January to 11 June, 20125,629
(As firearms certs are now issued on a three year cycle, yearly figures no longer reflect the numbers of certs/ licences in existence in the State in that year).
The three year fee for a standard Firearms Certificate was set in 2009 at €80 and like all Government fees charged for services they are subject to  review, from time to time.  The amount generated in respect of firearm certificates fees for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, and to date in 2012 is as follows:YearRevenue from fees2009€2,765,6302010€13,079,2512011€2,234,1792012 (up to 31/5/12)€402,884In the revised 2012 Estimates and the related budget provision, the projected revenue for 2012 for licence fees is €1,607,000.The Deputy has also asked for my views regarding the number of firearms in circulation.  Each application for a firearms certificate is considered on its own merits under the Firearms Acts.  The senior Garda officers of each District or Division are by law the designated persons for deciding on firearms applications.  This is an independent function carried out by them and they must consider a wide range of factors before granting any certificate.  The operation of the firearms licensing system is kept under review and, as I have informed the House previously, my primary concern is public safety.

The costs of security measures for these visits are borne by An Garda Síochána on behalf of the State, as host.  This is the normal practice and where security measures are necessary for Irish dignitaries making visits to other states, the host state bears the cost.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I can inform the Deputy that a range of strategies and legislative powers are employed by An Garda Síochána in order to respond to the situations referred to by the Deputy.  In particular, the Garda Síochána Policing Plan for 2012 includes as key actions the reduction of public disorder and criminal damage through pro-active responses to public disorder including:identifying anti-social behaviour ‘hot spots',the deployment of appropriate resources to particular locations,continued liaison with the licensed trade and those involved in the management of the night time economy,improving the feeling of safety in the community through the deployment of targeted high visibility patrols.In addition, each Garda District and Divisional Officer configures their policing response to local conditions, including by engaging with local communities as part of the Garda National Model of Community Policing and through the work of Joint Policing Committees.  The Joint Policing Committees provide a forum whereby issues of policing concern, including alcohol related anti-social behaviour, can be discussed and solutions recommended accordingly.Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 strong legal provisions are in place to deal with the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 also provides the Gardaí with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking, including exclusion orders in respect of premises, closure orders for licensed premises and catering outlets following anti-social behaviour related offences.  Under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, Gardaí may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place. These are a more efficient use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings when an offender pays the penalty.The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Gardaí to tackle misuse of alcohol.  The Act places restrictions on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse. The Gardaí may seize any bottle or container from a person under the age of 18 and which a Garda suspects contains alcohol to be consumed by a person under 18 in a public place.  They may also, in respect of adults, seize bottles or containers containing alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.  Programmes are available to all prisoners, but some programmes may not be suitable for prisoners on shorter sentences.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	403	In addition to the range of employment law enacted to protect workers from exploitation generally and the redress mechanisms for alleged breaches of employment law, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 (which came into effect on 7 June 2008) criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of labour exploitation (including domestic labour and agricultural labour). For the purposes of the Act, the term "trafficks" is broadly defined. For example, the commission of an offence does not require cross border movement or illegal entry into the State. It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment. Section 1 of the 2008 Act defines labour exploitation in relation to a person (including a child) as follows:(a) subjecting the person to forced labour,(b) forcing him or her to render services to another, or(c) enslavement of the person or subjecting him or her to servitude or a similar condition or state.An Garda Síochána is proactive in attempting to detect any breach of the provisions of the Act of 2008 and investigates all allegations of human trafficking with a view to identifying potential suspects and/or culprits.A comprehensive programme of training in the area of human trafficking has been undertaken within An Garda Síochána. In total over 600 Gardaí have now completed the intensive three day training course entitled "Trafficking in Human Beings; Prevention, Protection, Partnership and Prosecution." In addition, a further 3,500 members of An Garda Síochána have received awareness raising training relating to human trafficking. The overriding aim of the training is to provide members of An Garda Síochána with knowledge of indicators of human trafficking, where to look and how to identify victims of human trafficking.A number of potential victims of human trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation have been identified as working in the domestic labour sector. The incidents concerned are the subject of investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. However, to date, there have no prosecutions in respect of suspected or alleged incidents of human trafficking for labour exploitation in this State.  Three investigations have been completed and investigation files relating to human trafficking for labour exploitation have been submitted to law officers. Directions not to prosecute were received in each of these cases. A further investigation is almost complete and an investigation file relating to domestic servitude is expected to be submitted to the law officers in the near future.An Garda Síochána works closely with other police forces. As a result of an intensive investigation conducted in Ireland evidence was transferred to Romania by way of a mutual assistance request and in December 2009, three Romanian men were sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, five years and five years, respectively for the trafficking of Romanian nationals into Ireland for labour exploitation on farms in Wexford. A number of Romanian nationals who were discovered to have been exploited in this case were rescued and received support from relevant Irish state agencies. With the assistance of the Romanian authorities, the victims returned to Romania at their request.In a number of the cases under investigation by An Garda Síochána little, or no, evidence of human trafficking for labour exploitation has been found but alleged breaches of employment legislation have been identified in some of these incidents. An Garda Síochána works closely with the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) in these matters. This cooperation extends to joint inspections between the labour Inspectors and An Garda Síochána. No cases of forced labour have been encountered in the course of the joint inspections to date. Training has been provided by An Garda Síochána to NERA Inspectors. In addition, representatives from NERA and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Inspectorate attended a two day ‘Train the Trainer' course on human trafficking.An Garda Síochána works closely with relevant state agencies and non-governmental organisations in its efforts to identify and assist victims of human trafficking. In particular, where suspected or alleged incidents of human trafficking involve labour exploitation, personnel from the Garda National Immigration Bureau engage, where appropriate, with the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland.

I have been very concerned however about two prisoners who did not end their hunger strikes, and were approaching the point of real danger. As before, it has been difficult to get a reliable picture of what is the actual position, including the object of the strikes, despite contacts with both the Israeli authorities and with NGOs dealing with the prisoners.I have been encouraged by the fact that both the Israeli authorities and the prisoners clearly recognised the danger of the hunger strikes spiralling out of control, and found agreement last month to avoid this. I have already strongly urged both sides to seek to resolve the issues involved in these two remaining cases with all possible urgency.  I am pleased therefore that it is reliably reported that one of the two remaining cases, and the most advanced and critical one, has been resolved by agreement, and the prisoner has ended his hunger strike. I will continue to follow the other remaining case, and I look forward to an early resolution also of that.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as they do not capture data on the overall net cost of childcare there is, therefore, no statistical basis on which they can provide an estimate of the cost of making childcare tax deductible. In these circumstances, it is not possible to extrapolate the potential net cost to the Exchequer of the proposal.   I would have some concerns about the potential that any tax relief for childcare costs might have on charges for childcare, as it is possible that the main beneficiaries of any such tax relief would be the childcare providers. The introduction of such a relief would also potentially carry a large Exchequer cost which could not be countenanced at the current time.Notwithstanding the absence of tax relief for childcare costs, the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.  For this reason a number of support measures are available. These include, (i) the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, (ii) the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides free childcare places to qualifying FÁS and VEC trainees and (iii) the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. In addition, generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave are provided, as well as child benefit payments.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I am informed by the Central Bank that the Bank continues to redeem Irish pound banknotes, which ceased to be legal tender on 9 February 2002.   As of 31 December 2002, notes to the value of €299.7 million were outstanding. With the approval of the Board of the Bank, a provision of €60 million was created in respect of future redemptions. The balance of €239.7 million, which it was estimated would not be presented for redemption, was accounted for through the Profit and Loss account. This windfall gain then formed part of the payment of Surplus Income to the Exchequer for 2002, as proposed by the Minister for Finance in December 2001.Since 2002, the Bank has continued to redeem Irish pound banknotes which have been charged against the provision of €60 million. The provision was exhausted on 30 April 2010 and in November 2010 the Commission of the Bank approved a transfer of a further €10.0 million to the provision. Irish pounds to the value of €2.4 million were redeemed during 2011 leaving €235 million in Irish banknotes still outstanding and a balance of €5.7 million in the provision at end-December 2011. The balance in the provision at 31 May 2012 was €4.9 million.  The provision relates only to Irish pound banknotes.In respect of coin, as of 2002, the net proceeds from the issue of coin are passed directly to the Exchequer on an annual basis (section 137 of the Finance Act 2002). Irish pound coin to the value of €125 million is still in circulation and is redeemed by the Bank on behalf of the Minister for Finance. Should the Government decide to cease redemption of Irish pound coin, the Exchequer could be expected to benefit over time to the value of the amount outstanding (by way of a higher net proceeds of coin transfer to the Exchequer because the proceeds received from the issue of euro coin would no longer be reduced by the value of Irish pound coin redeemed). However, even assuming that all the outstanding coin will eventually be redeemed, this could not realistically be described as a windfall as the amount redeemed each year is relatively low (€0.4m in both 2011 and 2010).The value of the amount outstanding in respect of Irish pound banknotes and coin as at 31 May 2012 was as follows:Irish pound banknotes —€234 millionIrish pound coin          —€125 million.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	407	As the deputy is aware NAMA has acquired loans from the five participating institutions and is not the owner/operator of properties.  The Agency's role is that of a secured lender.  Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA's website and which are managed by the appointed receivers/administrators, properties continue to be managed by their existing owners or their professional managers/agents albeit NAMA takes a very close interest in their efficient management and sale with a view to maximum loan repayment in order to protect the position of the taxpayer.NAMA's primary concern is that properties securing its loans are professionally managed at the most economical cost to ensure that rental and occupancy is optimised towards the servicing of interest and capital repayment on related loans.  The owners/professional managers are responsible for the efficient running of properties, the collection of rents and service charges, arrangements for letting of vacant units and the operation of rent reviews in accordance with the leases into which tenants have entered.  As lender and holder of security on the asset, NAMA's approval is needed for key decisions such as significant new leases, rental reductions or abatements and plans for ultimate sale of the property.On the issue of rent abatements, as I have previously advised NAMA has published very clear Guidelines, available onwww.nama.ie, for tenants seeking a rent reduction from a NAMA debtor or receiver.  It is important to emphasise that applications for rent abatements may be made in situations where tenants of NAMA debtors can demonstrate that the rents payable under their current leases are in excess of current market levels and, as a result, that the viability of their businesses is threatened. In such circumstances, tenants may seek NAMA’s approval for rent reductions.  The Guidance Note is not intended to provide benefits to tenants whose businesses are trading profitably and who are in a position to honour their current contractual arrangements on rent.  By the end of May 2012, the Agency had approved 145 applications for rent reductions under these Guidelines with just 4 applications refused.NAMA is prohibited by Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act and the normal rules of banking confidentiality from commenting on individual debtors or arrangements between tenants and landlords who may be borrowers from NAMA but NAMA assures me that in its role as lender/security holder it responds promptly and pragmatically to requests from its borrowers regarding lease arrangements including rent abatements on their properties where there is a justifiable case.NAMA does not pay consultancy fees to debtors.  As previously advised to the House it is the Agency's practice to allow debtor companies to retain overhead costs from rental or other income that are produced by their assets where this is necessary for the operations of the debtor companies. The level of overhead is only agreed following a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the debtor's business plan by NAMA. Each cost element is reduced to the minimum and NAMA advised that the level of overhead sanctioned by NAMA typically represents a very significant reduction on the level which prevailed prior to NAMA acquisition of the loans: typically, reductions of 50% to 75% in overhead costs have been imposed by NAMA.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a tax on the commission charged.  The proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. This Bill is well advanced and it is hoped that it will be published this session.

However, it should be noted that an individual who rents out their residential property may be allowed a deduction, subject to certain conditions, in computing the taxable rents from that letting of 75% of the interest accruing on monies borrowed to purchase, improve or repair that property.

The Bank has to date received a number of completed reviews covering specific institutions and a further number of reviews are scheduled to be completed later in the year.  The Bank will submit a report to both me and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, when the review process has been completed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	411	In July 2011, a net amount of €16.5 billion was injected into Irish financial institutions. Following an examination of the nature of the transactions by the Central Statistics Office and Eurostat, €5.8 billion of the €16.5 billion injected was classified as a deficit-increasing capital transfer in the Maastricht Returns in March 2012.  However, the recapitalisation of July 2011 was fully reflected in Ireland's general government debt reported to Eurostat in September 2011, so Ireland is no worse off. This is simply a statistical reclassification from financial transaction to capital transfer for deficit purposes. There is no impact on our debt position.Eurostat reserved final adjudication in their April General Government Debt and Deficit release on the capital transfer amount because restructuring plans of Allied Irish Banks and Irish Life and Permanent, which were used in the analysis, were not approved at that time.  I believe that the Irish Life and Permanent plan is being finalised and will be completed shortly. It is expected that the Allied Irish Banks plan will also be completed in the coming months, ahead of the end Q3 2012 deadline as per the most recent Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies. When finalised, these restructuring plans must be submitted to the European Competition authorities. Once DG Comp has approved the plans Eurostat will be in a position to definitively classify the injections and we can confirm the impact on the General Government Deficit for 2011.

The Council was allocated a grant-in-aid of €650,000 in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2012.  The General Scheme of a Bill to be called the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012, which I published on the 26th of April 2012 in the context of providing information for the referendum on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, includes provisions for the statutory establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council which includes its funding arrangements.  The draft legislation proposes that the Fiscal Council should be funded directly from the Central Fund subject to an annual limit of €800,000.  This limit, which will be adjusted each year by the annual percentage change in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, represents an increase of 23% over the grant-in-aid provided for in 2012.  I expect to publish the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 before the summer recess.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	413	As the Deputy will be aware, a key component of the Financial Measures Programme (FMP) is the establishment of transparent deleveraging plans to reduce the Irish banking system to a manageable size and to stabilise its funding base. The Central Bank has agreed with the External Partners that a sustainable Loan to Deposit Ratio for the aggregate domestic banking system is 122.5%.  Total deleveraging achieved across government supported banks was €46 billion through end December 2011 against 2011 expected deleveraging of €36 billion.  In addition, Irish banks have enjoyed deposit inflows despite the very difficult international environment.It is important to maintain the progress in downsizing our banking system which was made in 2011, and we are working to refine the deleveraging framework to minimize risks to lending to the economy and discourage excessive competition for deposits. Nonetheless, it is also important, as part of the overall strategy to maintain progress in regard to deleveraging and this momentum will ensure that banks will be better able to support the real economy in the shortest possible timeframe.  As you may be aware the deleveraging programme is monitored on an on-going basis and discussed with EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF. Any refinements or adjustments which are required are considered and addressed as part of this process.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I have been informed by the covered banks that their wholesale funding maturity needs should be met as follows in the next two years:
IBRC:
IBRC is a non-pillar bank that had the majority of its deposits transferred to AIB in 2011 by Ministerial order. As a result, IBRC is heavily reliant on official sources for its funding. Any wholesale maturities that come due are met from either the Bank's existing resources or drawings on official sources.
PTSB:
PTSB expect to meet maturity needs from deposit growth and the benefits of restructuring the balance sheet. PTSB will continue to review opportunities for secured debt issuance.
AIB:
AIB has a planned term issuance schedule that will refinance maturing wholesale debt maturities out to the end of 2014, including a combination of Secured Funding and Government Guaranteed bond issues with unguaranteed issuances restarting from 2014 onwards.  The extent of AIB's wholesale funding refinancing requirements will be influenced by the level of customer deposit funding and deleveraging activity. These are on track. Continued stability in their customer deposit franchise would allow the bank to meet its wholesale maturity needs in the next two years even if it could not access wholesale markets by utilising its unencumbered liquidity buffer.
BOI:
In the case of BOI, a material reduction in the wholesale funding requirement to the end of 2013 is expected consistent with planned deleveraging and the achievement of a loan to deposit ratio of 122.5% by December 2013. Maturing open market term funding is more than offset by the planned reduction in the overall wholesale funding requirement, thus limiting the financing requirement from the open market.

PTSB:
PTSB have informed me that they are not in a position to answer this question as they have not finalised their redundancy plans.IBRC: IBRC have informed me that as part of IBRC’s progress towards wind down, the Bank is currently operating redundancy schemes in its Irish, UK and US operations. The redundancy schemes running at present in the UK, Ireland and the US are currently planning 169 redundancies at a total cost of c. €7.2 million* (average cost c. €43,000).  All exits from the Bank are to be completed by 30.06.2013. The redundancy scheme currently running in the US will result in the ultimate closure of the Bank’s operations there.
*Includes US$ amount for the US redundancy scheme converted using US/Euro FX rates as at 18.06.12.

AIB:
AIB have informed me that the costs prior to launch of the programme (programme still open) was approx €200m. However, AIB anticipate savings in the region of €170m per annum on completion of the programme assuming that targeted voluntary severance / early retirement numbers are delivered.  As you are aware, Bank of Ireland is not a state owned bank.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	416	While the economy is growing again, it will take time for export growth to feed through to the labour market and the domestic economy. This is because it will take households, firms, and government time to work through the imbalances which had built up during the boom.  The Government is acutely aware of the headwinds which the domestic economy faces in this regard. We have therefore taken a number of steps to support domestic activity and job creation, including the introduction of the Jobs Initiative shortly after coming into office and the structuring of Budget 2012 in such a way as to be as growth-friendly as possible.In addition, the Government also established NewERA and the Strategic Investment Fund within the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) last September, and published the Action Plan on Jobs in February. The Government has also taken a number of steps to ensure there is sufficient credit available to business. Moreover, in relation to tax-policy, we have also sought to support firms and encourage job creation through extending the three-year start-up relief scheme, improving the R&D tax credit scheme and replacing the Business Expansion Scheme with a new Employment and Investment Incentive.  Furthermore, I would point out that the Taoiseach has consistently sought to have growth moved up the European agenda, and I note that the "EU growth agenda" will be discussed at the European Council meeting on the 28th-29th June.Moreover, following long-term negotiations, the Government has reached agreement with Troika representatives that all of the proceeds from the sale of State assets will be used, in one shape or another, to support job creating initiatives in the economy, which will in turn support domestic demand. Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature. The other half, while destined eventually to pay-down debt, will, in the first instance, be constituted as a fund to guarantee additional lending into Ireland, for example by the EIB, in support of further investment in job-creating initiatives.Overall, the economy is expected to record a second successive year of positive growth this year. My Department's latest forecasts — which were published in April's Stability Programme Update — project GDP growth of 0.7 per cent this year with exports leading the way. The recovery is expected to broaden out and gain ground next year, with growth of 2.2 per cent foreseen.  These forecasts are similar to those of other domestic and foreign forecasters.  Regarding the domestic demand component, near-term prospects remain muted, with a further contraction envisaged for this year. However, the pace of decline is set to ease relative to 2011 and should come close to stabilising next year, before domestic demand starts to increase once again in 2014 and 2015.

This, I believe, will go some way to helping mortgage holders who purchased at the peak of the housing market.  Under the current system, mortgage interest relief is set to be abolished in 2013.  In Budget 2012, I extended the current rates of relief for anyone purchasing in 2012.  This is 25% for first-time buyers and 15% for non-first time buyers.  Anyone currently qualifying for mortgage interest relief or who purchases in 2012 will receive the relief up until the end of 2017.  These measures will cost in the region of €55 million per annum.  Mortgage interest relief is set to be abolished from 2018.There were two other property related tax measures in the Budget: the reduction in the rate of Stamp Duty on non-residential property transactions to a single rate of 2%, and the Capital Gains Tax incentive for property bought between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2013, which provides that, if the property is held for at least seven years, any gain related to the initial seven year holding period will be relieved from CGT.  The measures will facilitate greater activity within the property market, leading to additional employment and activity in related sectors.  Only the CGT measure relates to the housing market.The measures have been in place for six months so it is early to assess their impact.  However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been an increase in the number of property transactions reported to the eStamping system for Stamp Duty purposes — there were a total of 20,317 such transactions recorded in the first five months of 2012 compared to 18,207 in the same period in 2011.

The figures are available to download athttp://www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/cmab/Pages/ BusinessCredit.aspx and the latest table is also attached.In relation to the total outstanding stock of loans to SMEs, there are three figures for consideration, as shown in table A.14.1 — total outstanding loans to all SMEs, total outstanding loans to SMEs excluding those engaged in financial intermediation, and total outstanding loans to SMEs excluding those engaged either in financial intermediation or property-related sectors. Based on the change in the outstanding stock of loans to SMEs between end-Q1 2010 and end-Q1 2012, as reported to the Central Bank by all resident credit institutions, the change in lending to SMEs has been as follows:TableTotal outstanding loans to SMEs:6%Total outstanding loans to SMEs excl. Financial Intermediation:7%Total outstanding loans to SMEs excl. Financial Intermediation and Property Related Sectors:-20%I am informed by the Central Bank that it is important to note that the change in the stock of loans reported on the credit institutions' aggregate balance sheet can sometimes reflect non-transaction related effects, for example changes in the reporting population, valuation changes due to fluctuations in exchange rate effects, or other reclassifications. As a result, the Central Bank publishes quarterly transactions or "flows" figures, which provide details on the true underlying flow of business during the quarter. These figures adjust the change in stocks in order to strip out the impact of any such non-transaction effects. Based on these underlying flows, the developments in the outstanding stock of loans to SMEs between end-Q1 2010 and end-Q1 2012 are as follows:TableTotal outstanding loans to SMEs:-12%Total outstanding loans to SMEs excl. Financial Intermediation:-16%Total outstanding loans to SMEs excl. Financial Intermediation and Property Related Sectors:-15%It is also important to note that SMEs are paying down existing debts at a faster rate than they are demanding new lending. The November 2011 Mazars survey on credit demand published by my Department showed that only 36% of companies surveyed requested bank credit in the period April-September 2011. This reflects the level of finance required by the companies surveyed, for trading at current levels, together with a reluctance to borrow for investment in new capital projects until foreseeable returns are more positive.  It is for the above reasons that the lending targets applied to the pillar banks was viewed as being a more appropriate policy instrument than applying a target with respect to the overall stock of lending to SMEs.

Rounding may affect totals
The Deputy should be aware that in relation to 2011, the information is set out in the end-December 2011 Exchequer Statement, which is available on my Department's website.The figures for 2012 and 2013 are the estimates from the time of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) in late April and are likely to be subject to change as more up-to-date information becomes available later this year and into next.  Given that the bank guarantee (ELG Scheme) is subject to six-monthly EU Commission approval and that the Central Bank Surplus income is largely related to interest earned on the provision of exceptional liquidity assistance (ELA) whose future usage is difficult to estimate, it is not possible to reliably estimate the revenue from these sources beyond the years mentioned.As provided by the 2010 Finance Accounts, non-tax revenue as a proportion of total Exchequer revenues was 7.4% in 2010. The end-December 2011 Exchequer Statement showed that non-tax revenue accounted for 7.1% of all Exchequer revenues last year and April's Stability Programme Update estimates that they will account for 6.7% of Exchequer revenues this year and 4.8% next year so the share of overall Exchequer revenues is actually decreasing.In summary, as the table above illustrates, Exchequer non-tax revenue is forecast to decline over the next two years and I am satisfied that at this point these forecasts are robust in nature.

It is the case however that as a means of improving budgetary reporting and allowing for comparability officials from my Department are discussing with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the possibility of separately producing an alternative presentation of Exchequer information, some of which would be on a gross basis.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	422	The Report of the Commission on Credit Unions identified 51 credit unions at 31 December 2011 with total realised reserves below 10%, of which 25 credit unions were seriously undercapitalised with reserves below 7.5%.  The Report noted that, since December 2011, some credit unions have been assisted by private funds to address this position.The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has since 1989, operated on an all-island basis a savings protection scheme (SPS) for credit unions. The SPS operates by providing financial support to credit unions that get into difficulty.  As this is a privately owned and managed fund it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the information requested.  The Commission on Credit Unions recommended the establishment of a statutory stabilisation mechanism whereby financial assistance could be given to credit unions on an individual basis, in certain circumstances, with certain conditions attached to the provision of such assistance. This would be facilitated by the establishment of a stabilisation fund to be managed by the Central Bank. Work on the heads of Bill to provide the statutory basis for this recommendation is currently ongoing.

The Report recommended that the credit union sector be restructured on a voluntary, time-bound and incentivised basis. The Report set out a timescale for the completion of the restructuring process by the end of 2015.  Restructuring is to be facilitated by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (the ReBo). Expressions of interest have already been sought for appointment to the ReBo which is due to be established on an administrative basis.  This timescale is necessary as it provides for the establishment of the ReBo, engagement with credit unions, formulation of restructuring proposals and approval or otherwise of such proposals as well as allowing time for the ReBo to provide support and advice to restructured entities.

The NAMA Report for the fourth quarter of 2011 confirms that, of the loans transferred to end December 2011, 20% of the nominal debt was classified as performing and 80% was reported as non-performing. This is a disimprovement on the third quarter when 21% of the nominal debt was classified as performing and 79% was reported as non-performing. However, NAMA advises that it expects the situation to stabilise once NAMA's engagement with debtors moves into the implementation phase and as it invests in assets.As previously advised to the House, NAMA is continuing to address the issue of non-performing loans in the course of the Debtor Business Plan process. The outcome of NAMA's deliberations on the viability of a Debtor's business plan will determine whether these delinquent loans will be enforced or re-financed on new terms.  It should be noted that where Debtor Business Plans are agreed, the loans may be restructured and the performance profile of the overall loan book will change as performance is assessed against the restructured loans. The restructuring of loans will not reduce the amount owed to NAMA.

The net euro drawdown figures are net of deductions including the prepaid margin on the first EFSF disbursement and discounts applied for below par issuance and also reflect the effect of foreign exchange transactions.

These figures are for net drawdowns and include the effect of maturing and rolling over of short term EFSF financing.

XDR  is the currency code used to denote the IMF’s  Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), an international reserve asset which is composed of a basket of currencies consisting of the euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, and U.S. dollar.

1Non-euro liabilities are translated into euro at the rates of exchange at 15th June 2012. The net euro amount received by the Exchequer was €49.42 billion after adjustment for below par issuance and deduction of a prepaid margin (Note 2), and also reflect the effect of foreign exchange transactions.2A prepaid margin of €0.53 billion was deducted from the loan of €4.19 billion drawdown on 1 February 2011 giving a net liability of €3.67 billion. This margin prepayment will be refunded to Ireland in 2016. The total liability of €50.46 billion included in the National Debt (€130.1 billion at 15th June 2012) takes account of this reduction.3Short Term EFSF Funding totalling €1.48 billion maturing in 2012 is due to be replaced by longer term funding.

Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 — over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary — and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary.In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet future demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five year programme announced on 12 March last is focused on meeting those demographic needs. In the context, therefore, of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation, it is not possible for me to advance with a summer works programme this year.

As the Council is an independent body, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in individual cases. The matter should be taken up directly with the Council.

The well-tried methodology in place to deal with issues that arise in the course of the examination process is the development of the marking scheme by the Chief Examiner and his college of examiners in light of the circumstances of that year's examinations.  All observations received in relation to any subject are reviewed by the relevant Chief Examiner in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject.

This announcement did not include a proposal to establish a new primary school in the area referred to. However, my Department will continue to monitor enrolments in the Portobello area to ensure that there is sufficient school accommodation to meet any projected future demands.

My Department is awaiting receipt of a Stage 2a submission (Developed Sketch Scheme) from the school's Design Team.  Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements it has not been possible to advance all school building projects concurrently. The project referred to by the Deputy was not included in the five year construction programme announced in March.  Schools which have not been included in five year construction programme, but which were announced for initial inclusion in the building programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.

This new scheme is being legislated for by way of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, which is a major wide-ranging and complex piece of legislation.Following enactment and commencement, the new scheme will apply to all future new entrants in all areas of the public service including the civil service, education sector, health sector, local authorities, Gardaí, Defence Forces, regulatory sector, non-commercial State bodies, Oireachtas and the judiciary.  I am taking this Bill giving effect to the Single Scheme at Committee Stage on 21 June.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to pressing forward with the Bill to introduce the new scheme with a view to ensuring that it becomes law as soon as possible.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21647	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	442	Section 29 (3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Competition Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 30(1)(b) of that Act, the Competition Authority is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of the Act.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Authority, I have no direct function in the matter.Details of the undertakings who were held by the Courts to have breached competition law together with relevant offences and penalties are contained in the Annual Reports of the Competition Authority.  These Reports have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and are also available on the Authority's websitewww.tca.ie.  These Reports also contain information on the number of complaints received by the Authority in the year.I am aware that the total number of fines imposed on individuals and businesses under the Competition Act 2002 is four, ranging from €50,000 to €80,000 and totalling €260,000.  In addition twenty five fines were imposed between 2006 and 2012 under the Competition Act 1991, as amended, ranging from €1,500 to €35,000 and totalling €293,500.  Under the Criminal Law Act 1997, three fines totalling €75,000 were imposed on individuals for aiding and abetting breaches of the Competition Acts, also since March 2006.  32 fines in total were imposed for competition law offences, including aiding and abetting offences.The total number of jail terms imposed on persons for breaching the Competition Act 2002 was two of 15 months duration each. Both sentences were suspended for five years.  In addition, since March 2006, six jail sentences ranging from three months to two years and totalling 51 months were imposed on individuals under the Competition Act 1991, as amended.  All six of the sentences were suspended.  A further three jail sentences ranging from six months to fifteen months and totalling 33 months were imposed under the Criminal Law Act 1997 since March 2006 for aiding and abetting breaches of the Competition Acts. All three of these sentences were suspended.  In total therefore 11 jail sentences, all suspended, were imposed.

This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	448	The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.Every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant.  Persons seeking a rent supplement must, firstly, satisfy the Department that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources.  In addition, the Department must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  The Department must also be satisfied that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.In a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined.  In such cases, documentation is normally required showing that a joint custody arrangement is in place and being availed of before a decision can be made.  The fact that one parent is in receipt of rent supplement would not, in itself, preclude the other parent from being entitled to assistance towards their rent.

However, in accordance with the Programme for Government, the situation regarding the 75 raised bog natural heritage areas will be reviewed in conjunction with the Peatlands Council and decisions will be made in advance of the cutting season in 2014.In April 2011, the Government made a decision to put in place a compensation scheme for those who have been required to cease cutting on the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation.  My Department is giving priority to implementing this scheme, which is not applicable to sites in natural heritage areas. In the circumstances, and in light of the decision to review the approach to these areas more generally, the issue of any further purchase of land or rights in natural heritage area bogs, including the land referred to, is being kept under review.

I am advised that the basis for all the conclusions in the scientific study is set out in the study itself. I have organised for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputy and IFI scientists are available to discuss the report with the Deputy if he so wishes.  I am also informed that the study, which cites a number of relevant and internationally respected scientific papers, was subject to robust peer review in the context of its publication in the prestigious "Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences".Regarding the Marine Institute study cited by the Deputy, I understand that this refers to papers assessing the results of all the field experiments on the release of emamectin-treated salmon smolts protected against sea lice and non-protected control groups.  I am advised that findings in this study, in relation to the impact of sea lice infestation on marine survival of wild salmon, correspond in some respects to findings of the IFI study (2012) in that  both studies found broadly similar results on this issue.  The findings in the IFI study also indicate that sea lice emanating from marine salmon farms can be among the factors causing increased marine mortality of salmon.

Interested parties were invited to make submissions regarding the proposed revision in the current system of VRT and motor tax to adjust CO2 bands and rates in line with technological advances in motor vehicles while maintaining a positive environmental incentive to reduce transport emissions.The public consultation period ran to 1 March 2012.  Submissions were received from motoring representative organisations, motor dealers and other elements of the motoring industry, and also from private individuals.  These submissions addressed the likely impact of possible changes to the structure of motor taxation, and I do not propose to commission a separate study.  My Department and the Department of Finance are considering the submissions and possible options with a view to bringing proposals to Government.

These Acts also set out the functions and duties of local authorities in these areas, including powers of enforcement.  The ongoing implementation of enforcement actions is a matter for local authorities, primarily through litter wardens and dog wardens.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislation underpinning the household charge.  The household charge is on a self assessment basis and interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.  The exemptions from payment of the household charge are:Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction,Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive,Voluntary and co-operative housing,Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling,Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts, andResidential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).The waivers which apply concern:Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, andOwners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.

The development of new noise legislation by my Department will be considered in the context of this commitment; however, as indicated in the Government Legislation Programme published on 17 April 2012, it is not possible at this time to indicate when the legislation will be published, having regard to other priorities in the area concerned and the broader range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department’s remit.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I have no plans currently to introduce a monthly payment option for motor tax.   The current half-yearly and quarterly payment options incorporate a surcharge to cover the higher administrative costs involved in processing such applications.  The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-year and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of €20m.  Were a monthly pro-rata system to be introduced, the loss in income would have to be compensated for elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.  It would also have a negative transitional impact on the flow of income to the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund.  In considering options for a monthly payment option, regard would also have to be had to the set-up costs in the motor tax system, and increased ongoing administrative and financial costs and controls.

#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.   Following further consideration as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the Semi State sector could undertake the function, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.  The proposed public utility model represents a major change with significant implications for local government, the water industry in Ireland and its many stakeholders.   Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, and these skills within the Bord Gáis Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.A phased transition is proposed to ensure continuity of service and the building of a fit for purpose organisation within a reasonable timescale, and it is also expected that Irish Water will maintain a strong regional and local focus for operational delivery.  Service level agreements will be put in place between Irish Water and local authorities and these arrangements will be place until 2017 at the earliest.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  It will also mean that the majority of staff will remain in the direct employment of local authorities for a considerable period.   The Department has had initial engagement with ICTU, and there will be detailed engagement with Staff and Trade Unions in the rollout of the proposed changes.Work is now focused on the finalisation of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning in more detail. The implementation strategy is being developed in collaboration with other relevant Government Departments, local authorities, BGE and NewERA.  This strategy will provide the platform for dealing with a broad range of implementation issues during the transitional phase, including dealing with matters which cross the boundaries between Irish Water functions in relation to water services and those functions which will remain the responsibility of local authorities or other State bodies which impact on the water environment.   The rollout of the strategy will also involve co-operation with local authorities and staff to ensure that the change is managed well.  The strategy will focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following a restructuring process, and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in this reform process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I wish to inform the Deputy that under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed by the Service that it has been providing the funding necessary for the ongoing upkeep of the courthouse in Ballyhaunis, including in respect of necessary repairs and maintenance.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.I am also informed by my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that information in relation to investigations, prosecutions and successful convictions for offences under the Companies Acts 1963-2009, for the years 2003 to 2011 inclusive, are available in the Annual Reports of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement for those years. The relevant Annual Reports have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are also available on the website of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement atwww.odce.ie/en/media_general_publications.aspx.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill will provide for the establishment of a DNA database, a commitment in the Programme for Government. The database will assist the Garda Síochána in the investigation of crime and in finding and identifying missing and unknown persons. It will do so by providing the Gardaí with a source of high quality intelligence that will facilitate better targeted investigations.  The database will be populated by DNA profiles generated from biological samples taken from persons detained in connection with the investigation of serious offences (generally those attracting sentences of 5 years or more) and convicted persons including persons subject to the registration requirements under the Sex Offenders Act 2001.DNA profiles constitute sensitive personal data. As such, their retention on a database or otherwise constitutes an encroachment on the individual's right to privacy. With this in mind, the Bill will adopt a carefully calibrated approach to their retention and use, taking account of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. For example, retention arrangements will distinguish between persons who have been convicted and those who have not been proceeded against or who have been acquitted and between adults and children.Indefinite retention will generally apply in relation to convicted persons (subject to some special provision for child offenders) whereas persons who have not been proceeded against or who have been acquitted will have an opportunity to apply to the Commissioner for the removal of their profiles from the database in certain circumstances. In the event that they do not do so or their application is refused, default removal periods will apply ranging from 5 to 10 years.  The approach adopted in the Bill will maximise the effectiveness of the database in the fight against crime while ensuring that the individual's right to privacy is not infringed in a disproportionate manner.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in July, 2011.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.  As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Persons who feel they have been discriminated against in access to services on the basis of their family status and/or civil status may avail of the redress mechanism provided under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2011 and refer a complaint to the Equality Tribunal. Information and advice is available from the Equality Authority in respect of this legislation and on making such complaints. In view of the independence of these agencies in the exercise of these statutory functions, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on any particular case.In the event of non-compliance with a court order, parties may bring any breach to the attention of the court. The court can only act to enforce or vary an order where the matter is brought back before the court.  I made the comments referred to by the Deputy in the context of a debate on non-marital fathers and guardianship in which I also stated that: "there is no major obstacle to the biological father of a child being named as the guardian of the child in circumstances in which the father has an established relationship with that child."For the very many fathers who take responsibility and who form relationships with their children, there are simple measures they can take to secure their legal responsibilities in relation to the child: either by making a statutory declaration referred to in section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Children Acts 1964-1997 together with the child's mother appointing the father as a guardian, or in the absence of agreement between the parents, by seeking a court order appointing the father as a guardian under section 6A of the Acts.

Given the extensive costs which would fall on the Exchequer on the provision of a guardian ad litem service for children in family law proceedings, I have no plans to make such provision in the prevailing economic conditions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	477	The Probation Service is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in the community.  Their role is to work with offenders to challenge and change their behaviour and make good the harm done by their offending.  Historically, the Probation Service did hold a role providing reports to the courts in respect of applications for custody and access.  Relevant legislation, such as section 47 of the Family Law Act, 1995 allowed probation officers, as well as persons nominated by the Health Service Executive or any other person specified in the order to prepare social reports in family law proceedings.  However the involvement of the Probation Service in family law cases was discontinued  due to lack of dedicated resources and for policy reasons.  There are no plans to re-establish this service.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 129 together.I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the strength of An Garda Síochána in all ranks on the 31 May 2012, the latest date for which figures are available, was as set out in the following table:Rank31/05/2012Commissioner1D/Commissioner2A/Commissioner8Chief Supt.38Superintendent148Inspector284Sergeant1,940Garda11,160Total13,581While regulations have previously provided for the numbers permitted in each rank, these have been upper ceilings for those numbers, rather than target strengths, and it is therefore not practical to indicate precise levels of vacancies at the different ranks.  It is a matter for Government to decide on the number of appointments to senior ranks (above Inspector level), and a matter for the Commissioner to make appointments to ranks up to Inspector level.I am, however, fully conscious of the importance of maintaining a sufficient strength in the senior ranks to support the investigative, management and supervisory capacity of the Force. To this end I am in ongoing discussions with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to agreeing an approach by Government on the appropriate strengths in the senior ranks, taking into account  reforms and efficiencies being implemented by the Commissioner.  I expect that this will enable the making of a number of senior appointments in the near future.

Civil Legal Aid
The Legal Aid Board spent €54,207 in County Galway during 2011. This represents 3% of the Legal Aid Board's Private Practitioners Budget.
Criminal Legal Aid
The Deputy should note that details of payments made to barristers are not available because relevant addresses on the Department's payments system are shown only as payments to the Law Library and therefore cannot be differentiated.  The information being provided in this category is therefore in respect of solicitors only.  A total of €852,114 was paid to Galway Solicitors in 2011, which represents 2.94% of total payments nationally.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 to 123, inclusive, together.The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in relation to the incident alleged to have occurred in Banbridge.  Neither I nor An Garda Síochána have information to support the allegations relating to this jurisdiction.  There is, of course, no question of members of the PSNI or the British Army having lawful authority to act in this jurisdiction.  Instead, as I have informed the House previously, An Garda Síochána and the PSNI co-operate very closely in discharging their respective roles.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Under the Garda Síochána Acts 2005-2007, the Commissioner is required to submit, before November of each year, a policing plan for the forthcoming year.  The Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been prepared and therefore it is not possible to say at this stage what it may contain, although it is expected that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network.While the latest recorded crime statistics show a decrease in most types of crime during 2011, I am, of course, concerned at the increase in certain categories of crime, notably burglaries and other property crimes.  In particular, I share the widespread outrage at recent incidents of aggravated burglary, where elderly people were terrorised in their own homes.  Although the overall incidence of crime is generally lower in rural than in urban areas, I am very conscious of the deep distress these disturbing assaults can cause and the fear they give rise to in rural communities.I welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the resources available to him in a targeted and strategic approach — though the use of such measures as Operation Fiacla — and continues to confront those who are engaging in this form of criminality.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	484	As the Deputy will be aware, membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and offences committed by members of criminal gangs may or may not be connected with an individual's membership of such gangs.  It is therefore not feasible to provide the Deputy with the particular information sought.  However, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which entered into force on 23 July 2009, introduced a number of provisions which strengthened the law dealing with organised crime.Since the enactment of that legislation on 23 July 2009, up to 31 May, 2012, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the provisions of the Act have been used on 164 occasions where arrests have been made relating to organised crime.  In the same period, eight individuals have been charged under the legislation, six under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (participating in organised crime) and two under section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (directing a criminal organisation).In February, 2012, the two persons charged with offences contrary to section 71A, Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, 2009 were before the Courts and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of an offence contrary to section 72 — participating or contributing to certain activities. The Law Officers directed that the other charges be withdrawn and on 11th June, 2012, both persons were sentenced to 9 years imprisonment. The remaining six individuals are still before the Courts.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no function in the matter. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána was 13,581.What will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force. Difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.The decision on when recruitment will re-commence will also take into account the rate of retirements in the Garda Síochána and Government targets, set in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, to reduce the numbers of public servants.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	486	The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and dealt with appropriately, including by juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge penalty notices or initiating criminal proceedings.  Any persons found engaging in such behaviour will be dealt with appropriately in accordance the law.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 135 together.My replies to previous Parliamentary Questions explained the criteria which applies including the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account.  Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons.  The prisoner, their family, or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession.  Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board though it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect.As I stated, when publishing the Report on the escape of a prisoner from Loughan House, the decision to send this prisoner to Loughan House was wrong.  At the time, I instructed the Director General of the Irish Prison Service to take all necessary steps to ensure that a mistake of this nature does not reoccur.  I have been informed by the Director General that measures have been taken to provide additional oversight in the decision making processes in order to ensure that such a decision cannot be made in the future.  Where consideration is being given to the transfer of a prisoner serving a sentence for a homicide related offence to an open centre, that decision must now be made by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service.All decision making staff and prison governors have been reminded of the need to take appropriate account of all the criteria to be applied to such decision making in a balanced and considered manner.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	489	The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish prisons.  Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates or criminal activities outside the prisons.  The Deputy can be assured that gang members are being managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership/allegiance to these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.I am aware of the difficulties for everyone involved and appreciate the efforts made by prison management and staff to deal with this issue on a daily basis within our prisons.  The Irish Prison Service has introduced all possible measures to deal with this and has built up considerable experience in this regard.  A number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons. For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG) have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison. These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda Síochána to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs.  Gardaí are also provided with reports detailing the release dates of this category of prisoner.  Furthermore, the Risk Management of Offenders Group within the Irish Prison Service meet on a regular basis to share intelligence and decide in a strategic and collaborative fashion on the placement of leading gang members across the prison estate, having regard to the associated protection issues involved.

I am making further enquiries with the relevant authorities to see if information of the nature sought is available and I shall be in further contact with the Deputy in this regard.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	491	There has been a significant level of staff retirements across the public sector as a whole over the past year with the Prison Service being no exception.  The moratorium on public sector recruitment also applies to the Prison Service.  While some of the retirements have been offset by a certain level of sanctioned recruitment, the Prison Service has nonetheless had to absorb significant staff losses.Any shortfall in staffing is managed on an ongoing basis in line with the manpower planning strategy of each prison.  The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, also referred to as the Croke Park Agreement, has put in place a transformation programme as part of the prison reform programme enabling the Prison Service to continue to deliver services at the same or an enhanced level notwithstanding reductions in staff numbers in each prison.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is ongoing but limited due to resource constraints. The current budgetary provision provides for approximately 30,000 paid training mandays. In 2011 and 2012, I sanctioned paid training mandays to include support for the training of new recruits to the RDF. This was sufficient to train approximately 400 recruits during 2011 and 2012. The military authorities manage recruitment in this context. The numbers actually enlisted in any one year may not reflect the numbers of recruits trained in that year. In 2011 there were a total of 267 reservists enlisted and up to the end of May 2012 there have been a total of 85 enlistments to the RDF.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.Lariam is a malaria chemo-prophylactic agent first authorised for use in 1989 by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), which is the statutory regulatory body charged with regulating the use of medicines to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines available in Ireland.  Research has shown that it is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  While certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in Drug Safety Newsletters in 1996 and 2003, the Irish Medicines Board remained of the view that the benefit/risk profile for the product remained acceptable. The IMB continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate. Lariam remains the medication of choice for the Defence Forces for missions to sub-Saharan Africa and continues to be certified by the Irish Medicines Board.There are two other IMB-licensed anti-malarial medications (chemoprophylaxis) available to the Defence Forces-Doxycycline and Malarone.The choice of chemoprophylaxis medication depends on the risk of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and finally adherence issues:a. Doxycycline has to be taken in the absence of dairy products.  It has a daily dosage regime.  While it can cause minor but troublesome, mainly gastrointestinal side effects, it can also produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes (akin to severe sun burn) in some individuals.  This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climes. For this reason it is not recommended for first line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  It is the anti-malaria chemoprophylaxis of first choice by the Defence Forces in some geographic regions, e.g. Afghanistan;b. Malarone is unsuitable for use as it is licensed for no more than 28 days continuous use in a malarious area by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB).  In this context this prophylactic agent is only suitable for use where the overseas deployment does not exceed 28 days.  It has a daily dosage regime.  All three of these drugs are recommended by the World Health Organisation and other travel advisory bodies such as the United States Centre for Disease Control.In accordance with best international practice in prescribing any of these medications, and taking account of the contra-indications, warnings and side effects highlighted by the IMB, the Defence Forces screen all personnel for medical suitability.  The screening system rules out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions for example depression, anxiety, neurodegenerative disorders etc., which, as has been indicated by the IMB and other regulatory bodies worldwide, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.In the case of overseas missions to malarious areas, the medical screening involves a one-on-one assessment of the individual's suitability to be prescribed the selected anti-malarial agent in line with current IMB guidelines.  This typically involves review of the individual's previous experience, if any, with the medication. The individual's medical history is also screened for those conditions which have been identified as precipitating serious side effects in association with the medication.  In addition, blood tests are carried out to ensure that the liver is healthy, as liver disease is an accepted contraindication to the use of Lariam.It is the policy of the Defence Forces Medical Corps that personnel who are found suitable for Lariam should commence their medication three — four weeks in advance of their travel.  The purpose of this precaution is two-fold — while it allows a slow build up of the medication in the bloodstream, it also permits assessment by the person of their individual reaction to the medication while still in Ireland. During this "probationary" period the individual can consult with a Medical Officer (MO) over any adverse reaction, minor or major. Some minor reactions may be transient but if persistent, or troublesome, the individual will be deemed to have ‘sensitivity' to the medication and will be found not medically suitable for the mission.Personnel are screened both before and after deployments and all necessary actions are taken to ensure that those with contraindications to Lariam use are deemed unsuitable for overseas service and are not prescribed the medication.

Also the establishment of the Authority as a separate agency under the aegis of the Department of Defence (as proposed in the Bill) would involve additional costs in terms of staff, accommodation, expenses and payments to members of the Authority, which would be significantly greater than the costs incurred by my Department in administering the Curragh Lands.  This Government has targeted the rationalisation of State agencies as a key cost saving measure and in that context it would be inappropriate to establish a separate agency to manage work currently being done by my Department. Given the requirements of administrative efficiency, and the technical difficulties with the Bill I do not consider it prudent to reactivate the Bill.   The management and protection of the Curragh plains is an on-going process.  The Curragh provides a working environment for three main users, the Defence Forces, the horse-racing and training industry and sheep owners.  In recent years there has also been a marked increase in the level of use as a leisure facility mainly because of the population growth in the area.Officials from my Department meet regularly with the various parties involved in the use and management of the Curragh, for example there have recently been meetings with the Turf Club, the Curragh Golf Club, An Garda Síochána and Kildare County Council.  A wide range of issues are discussed at these meetings including the development and protection of the Curragh plains and how best to deal with the day to day issues of illegal parking, dumping, etc.Also as part of the on-going management of the Curragh my Department officials liaise with various Departments and State Agencies including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the Chief State Solicitors Office to ensure that best practice is adhered to in relation to the development and up keep of the Curragh Plains.

The person named wrote to my Department on 13 June enquiring about eligibility under the National Reserve.  A reply issued to the person named on 18 June.The 2012 National Reserve caters for farmers, who commenced farming after 17th May, 2010.  Applicants are required to submit a 2012 Single Payment application form detailing all lands which they are currently farming.  In addition, applicants are required to meet certain criteria with regard to income limits and educational qualifications. Off-farm income cannot exceed €30,000 and total income, including farm income, cannot exceed €40,000. Applicants must have obtained a FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture or its equivalent. The green certificate in farming is regarded as equivalent for this purpose.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 15th May, 2012.The National Reserve is a scarce resource and is only replenished from entitlements that remain unused over a period of two consecutive years. Therefore, applicants who have existing entitlements with a value of €10,000, or greater, will not be eligible for an allocation of entitlements from the 2012 National Reserve.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	499	Since the introduction of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, early years settings that are registered with the HSE have to comply with the Regulations concerning their practice.  These Regulations cover the core obligations of the adult practitioner which are set out in Part II, Section 5 and state that:
“A person carrying on a pre-school service shall ensure that each child’s learning, development and well-being is facilitated within the daily life of the service through the  provision of the appropriate opportunities, experiences, activities,  interaction, materials and equipment, having regard to the age and stage of development of the child and the child’s cultural context”. 
While these Regulations do not include a formal requirement for adults to be qualified, the guidelines clearly recognise the relationship between qualifications of staff and meeting the requirements of the Regulations:
“It is acknowledged that many childcare staff have a qualification or are working towards achieving one.  In centre-based services, it is considered that the person in charge should aim to have at least fifty percent of childcare staff with a qualification appropriate to the care and development of children.  The qualified staff should rotate between age groupings”.
The de-facto standard that exists for childcare practitioners is set out in Síolta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education. Standard 11 governs professional practice and states that:"Practising in a professional manner requires that individuals have skills, knowledge, values and attitudes appropriate to their role and responsibility within the setting.  In addition, it requires regular reflection upon practice and engagement in supported, ongoing professional development”.
Within this standard, the recommended minimum educational requirement for adults to be included for the purposes of calculating ratios of adults to children is FETAC Level 5 or equivalent.The introduction of universal pre-school provision in January 2010 and with it the requirements that pre-school leaders have to have a minimum of a full award at FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications has acted as a major impetus  for early years practitioners to acquire qualifications.  To assist staff to achieve the full requirement in advance of the September 2012 deadline, arrangements were put in place by my Department to provide a subsidised on-line training initiative.  A subsidy of €50 per module was provided which reduced the cost per module to €125.The early years sector is to be commended on the level of upskilling that has taken place in recent years and which, in the main, has been done voluntarily and in the person's own time.  Early Years practitioners have taken responsibility for their own development as practitioners and are to be congratulated on their commitment to life-long learning.  Much as I would like to be in a position where I could incentivise all relevant training for early years practitioners, our current economic situation is such that this is not possible.  Training standards and quality measures in the early years sector will be addressed in the Early Years Strategy.  Work has commenced on developing that strategy.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	500	The purpose of the forthcoming National Children and Young People's Policy Framework is to provide an overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.  The Children and Young People's Policy Framework will build onOur Children — Their Lives, Ireland’s first children’s strategy which was published in 2000, and it will cover the period from 2012 to 2017.  The development of a new policy framework will also meet one of the key recommendations in the implementation plan for the Ryan Report.The new Children and Young  People's Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way to comprehend the  continuum of the lifecourse from infancy, through early and middle childhood, to  adolescence through to early adulthood.  The policy framework will further bring together key policies of relevance to children and young people that are instanced in the Programme for Government including those relating to prevention and early intervention initiatives, early childhood education, breaking the cycle of disadvantage through area based approaches to address child poverty, addressing youth homelessness and aftercare provision, and addressing issues around  anti-social behaviour.As it is an overarching policy framework, it is not a vehicle for developing or setting out an national training programme for any practice frameworks.  However, the implementation of quality measures in the early years sector is likely to form part of the Early Years Strategy, one of the age cohort strategies which will be developed under the policy framework. Work has commenced on developing that strategy.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I recently announced that my Department has begun work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy. I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing to this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland's Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for under-one age group.  At present pre-school services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is pro-active in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children's lives.

The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) sends an Article 15 Assessment Report on the prospective adoptive parents to a Hague Convention approved Accredited Body nominated in advance by the prospective adoptive parents.  The Accredited Body sends an Article 16 Child Report to the AAI. If the AAI approves the proposed placement and the referral is accepted by the prospective adoptive parents, the AAI will issue an Article 17 Placement Approval Notice to the Accredited Body nominated by the prospective adoptive parents. The Accredited Body may then place the child with the prospective adoptive parents.Prospective adoptive parents should not take custody of a child or accept a placement prior to the Adoption Authority of Ireland issuing an Article 17 Placement Approval Notice.  The AAI also advises that the National Central Authority for the United States of America (the State Department) has informed the AAI that the State Department is the only Agency in the USA authorised to issue an Article 23 certificate.  Further details will be announced on the Adoption Authority of Ireland's website.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.Improving access for patients to both unscheduled and scheduled care in hospitals across the country is central to the role of the Special Delivery Unit which I established in my Department.  Since the SDU become operational in September 2011, it has worked closely with a range of hospitals across the country including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  Both hospitals work closely with the SDU Liaison Officer and there are weekly meetings held with the management teams of both hospitals along with representation from management of the local community services.  In addition to discussing current performance issues and trends, the Liaison Officer works with the hospitals to improve patient pathways and develop and improve operational issues.While the provision of funding is not a core function of the SDU, there are limited resources available to assist hospitals to meet its targets in relation to unscheduled and scheduled care.  With regard to unscheduled care (Emergency Departments) funding was made available to Our Lady of Lourdes and Connolly Hospitals as part of the successful SDU initiative in 2011 to ensure that the number of patients waiting in ED was kept to a minimum over the Christmas and New Year periods.  A limited amount of funding has also been made available in 2012 to assist the hospitals to meet their targets in relation to trolley waits. In relation to Connolly Hospital, funding related to opening additional bed capacity for short-periods and also to fund an initiative for hospital avoidance for older persons run by the Geriatricians.  In relation to Our Lady of Lourdes, funding has been made available for an initiative involving Community/Hospital Liaison, Weekend Liaison Nurse and Home Support to enable earlier discharge home and avoid hospital admissions. In addition, I have made funding available to Our Lady of Lourdes to facilitate the opening of 11 acute medical beds to cover a bed capacity shortage identified by the National Acute Medicine Programme.To date the SDU interventions in relation to unscheduled care have resulted in a reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys in ED. In relation to Connolly Hospital, up to 8 June 2012, there has been a reduction of 12.6% in the numbers waiting on trolleys when compared with the same period in 2011. In relation to Our Lady of Lourdes the reduction has been 18%.  With regard to Scheduled Care (In-patient and Day Case Surgery) last year, I instructed all hospitals that no person should be waiting more than 12 months for surgery by the end of the year. The scheduled care access targets set for public hospitals for 2012 are that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for surgery, no child should wait more than 20 weeks for surgery and no person requiring a routine GI endoscopy should wait more than 13 weeks.Our Lady of Lourdes reached the 2011 12 month target with some targeted assistance for a small number of cases from the NTPF. In this year the hospital is progressing towards the 2012 access targets assisted by a targeted programme of support agreed between OLOL and the NTPF. This support is directed towards adult ENT, Urology and GI endoscopy procedures and also towards paediatric ENT and General surgery. These are the areas where the greatest challenges, in terms of faster access times for procedures, exist.  Connolly Hospital also reached the end 2011 12 month maximum waiting time target. The hospital has agreed a programme of support with the NTPF in order to ensure delivery of the 2012 maximum access times targets for adults, children and for routine GI endoscopy procedures. This support is focussed on General Surgery, GI endoscopy and on Respiratory Medicine.

A call for submissions was made in national newspapers and a notice was placed on the Department of Health website. The closing date for receipt of submissions is the 16th July. Nursing Homes Ireland, and any other interested parties, have an opportunity to feed into the review through that consultation process.When the public consultation process has concluded, the Department of Health will be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review. This process takes approximately 4 months. It is anticipated that the review itself will take approximately three months to complete. It is expected that the review will commence in the last quarter of this year and be completed in early 2013.It is not possible to be more specific about the exact timelines involved at this point. The timeframe for the Request for Tenders being published will be dependent on how many submissions are received and how long it takes to analyse them. Thereafter, the awarding of a contract for the review will depend on how many tenders are received. The more tenders that are received, the longer it will take to evaluate them.The Terms of Reference for the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme are:Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation—1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices,3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services,4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other  sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review may require significant amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I am committed to exploring a range of mechanisms to seek to secure public bicycle schemes in other cities, including Galway.  Although a scheme in a city such as Galway is technically feasible, its commercial viability would require a collaborative approach with the private sector.  Funding provision to meet the capital investment costs of a scheme has been identified within the five-year allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures Capital funding.  However, operational funding is not available from within the constrained current funding allocation.  My Department is exploring options to meet the operating costs of a scheme including a sponsorship deal which could prove to be very attractive for a private sector organisation.  There is also potential for funding that could be unlocked by Galway City Council through the provision of additional advertising space in the city.  However, the potential and extent of funding from advertising will require further examination.  Optimal procurement approaches will be determined in the context of the best mechanisms to bridge the operational funding gap.
