          <p eId="para_1">Rents have soared to unaffordable levels in the decade that Fine Gael has been in power. The latest <i>daft.ie</i> report is a nightmare read for workers and families caught in the private rental trap. The report shows that new rents across the State increased by nearly 14% in 2022. All counties bar one saw double-digit increases. Some of these increases are frightening: County Mayo, up 21%; County Roscommon, up 20%; and County Galway, up 19.4%. The average rent now stands at a staggering €1,733 a month. Here, in Dublin, it is even worse, with tenants paying on average €2,293 per month. These are extortionate sums and there is worse to tell of. Apartments blocks are being built now where the asking rents will be even higher. Indeed, in my constituency there are three-bedroom apartments newly built where people are being asked to fork out nearly €4,000 a month in rent. That is €48,000 a year just for rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Meanwhile, what people are being offered for their hard-earned money is beyond a joke: €625 per month for a bunk bed in a room with three other people, which is the one I am showing the Taoiseach; €1,880 per month for a room the size of a parking space where you pull your bed down, which is the one I am now showing the Taoiseach; and €1,100 per month for a bedroom, use of the kitchen and a utility room, but the rest of the house, which is in County Kildare, is off limits, which is the one I am now showing the Taoiseach. This is soul-destroying stuff.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> The rent crisis has had a devastating impact on the lives of an entire generation. People in their late 30s and 40s are stuck in house shares because they cannot afford to rent a place of their own. Young people are unable to move out of their parents' homes because they have not a chance of renting. So many are financially crippled by years of paying these rack-rents and are faced with the choice of moving back in with mam and dad or emigrating for their shot at a better life in another country. At the sharpest end of this crisis, thousands of families face losing the roof over their heads when the eviction ban expires in April. This is all happening because Government housing policy is failing.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> Week after week, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael come in here and gaslight Ireland’s renters by telling them that their housing plan is working, but how they can make that claim to people who hand over the lion's share of their income on rent and who then see the rest of their income gobbled up by sky-high energy bills, childcare fees and grocery bills is beyond me.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Renting in Ireland means your life and aspirations are on hold. You wonder when the next ripoff hike is going to happen or when the landlord might tell you to get out. It is no way to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Léiríonn géarchéim na gcíosanna atá ag éirí níos measa teip polasaí tithíochta an Rialtais. Ní mór don Rialtas gníomhú anois chun cíosóirí a chosaint. Ciallaíonn sé sin cosc a chur ar arduithe cíosa agus cosc ar díbirt a shíneadh amach. Renters are now at breaking point and it is the job of the Government to protect them. I am asking the Taoiseach to do three things: first, to legislate urgently to ban rent increases for three years; second, to deliver a meaningful cut in rents by putting a month’s rent back to into tenants’ pocket through a refundable tax credit; and, third, to extend the ban on evictions until the end of the year.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_2">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as a ceist. Is é Tithíocht do Chách an plean atá againn chun úinéireacht tí a chur i bhfeidhm, a chinntiú go bhfuil rochtain ag gach duine tithíocht ar ard-chaighdeán chun cobhsaíocht a thabhairt do chíosóirí, agus chun daoine atá i mbaol a bheith gan dídean a chosaint. Is cuid dár gcultúr agus dár stair í úinéireacht tí. Ní féidir linn glacadh leis nach mbeidh daoine in ann a gcéad teach a cheannach go mbeidh siad greamaithe i laincis cíosa.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> At the outset, I thank the Deputy for her question. As she knows, Housing for All is our plan. It is all about making sure people have a secure home and, ideally, a home that they own if they wish to become a homeowner. Rents in Ireland are very high and a lot of people are struggling to pay the rent and everyone on this side of the House acknowledges this. It hits hardest on people who are moving out of home for the first time, people who are returning to Ireland - about 30,000 people return to Ireland every year - as well as people who are new to the country having come here to work in our public and private sectors. The Government is acting to help. We are helping in four ways that are significant. First, there is a rent tax credit of €500 per renter, €1,000 for a couple, and €1,500 for three people sharing. We have had 170,000 applications already for this rent tax credit. We encourage people who have not applied to do so. It will cover a few weeks' rent for a lot of people and one month's rent in some cases. I hope it is something we can build on in future budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Cost rental, which has been talked about for a long time and was initiated by the last Government, has been made a reality under this Government. It provides cost rental housing that people can rent with secure tenancies at a much lower rent than the market rent. We want to scale that up over the coming years and we intend to do exactly that.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> There are rent pressure zones, which most renters are covered by, meaning rent increases are between 0% and 2% per year. The <i>daft.ie</i> report, to which the Deputy referred, shows that rents rose by about 3.8% for existing tenants - the vast majority of tenants - in the past year. This is much lower than the figure of 13.7%, which only refers to new-to-market tenancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> In addition, the Government is helping people to buy, which is the most significant thing in my mind because we want people to become the owners of their own homes. About 70% of people in Ireland own their own home. I would like to see that figure much higher. That figure is certainly nowhere near that high for younger people. It is probably around half that figure. That is why we want to see more people buying their own home and that is why we are helping. There is the help-to-buy scheme where people get two years' of their income tax back so they can buy their own home. That is a scheme that Sinn Féin promised to take away for first-time buyers. We now have the first home scheme for people who can get a mortgage but do not have enough to buy the house. That gap can be bridged through the first home scheme, something which Sinn Féin has promised to take away if it gets into government. That is why we need to make sure these schemes stay in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">I have just set out what is the reality for so many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">This is now beyond crisis mode. People are paying €640 per month for a bunk bed sharing with three other people in a small bedroom. That is four people in one room. Where does this end? Where does this stop? At what point does reality dawn and do we see the necessary actions? The Taoiseach has set out what the Government has done under its plan, Housing for All. It is not working; ask any renter or anyone out there who lives in the real world and they will tell him the magnitude of his failure because they live it every single day. </p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I put it to the Taoiseach again that he needs to do three things. First, he needs to effectively cut rent by putting a month's rent back in every renter's pocket by means of a refundable tax credit. Second, he needs to ensure there are no further rent hikes. The rent pressure zones are not delivering that at all. Third, and I would like him to address this point in particular, the eviction ban must be extended to the end of the year. If it is not extended, not alone will we have these still soaring, disgraceful, rack-rents, but we will have a further surge in homeless which would be an intolerable situation.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">We are acting on this. Just in the past few weeks, we have introduced rent tax credits at €500 per renter, €1,000 for a couple, three people sharing getting €1,500 and four people sharing getting €2,000. That is going to help people in a meaningful way with their rent costs. That is something I believe we can build on in future budgets if the public finances allow. We are also making a reality of cost-rental housing. This is something talked about for a very long time and it is now a real option for people to be able to rent securely and pay a rent that is much lower than the market rent. We need to scale that up big time over the years ahead. We are doing exactly that using the Land Development Agency, LDA, in particular, and we have the rent pressure zones. Most tenants in Ireland are covered by rent pressure zones now. These are sitting tenants and as we know from the <i>daft.ie</i> report, rents rose for sitting tenants by approximately 3.8% last year which is very different from what is the case for new-to-market properties. The only way we can deal with the very high rents for new-to-market properties is by increasing supply, and that means standing up to politicians and parties who oppose new developments, often opposing them specifically because they are for rent-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">The cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on workers, families and businesses right across the country. Since 2021, energy prices have trebled. They have more than doubled since Russia invaded Ukraine last year. Average energy costs for consumers are now a staggering €4,300 per year. Everyone getting their gas and electricity bills in recent weeks will have been shocked by the amounts. As consumers suffer, energy companies are profiteering from this crisis and making what can only be described as obscene profits. At what point will the Taoiseach say enough is enough? These relentless price increases cannot continue. The toll they are taking on both families and businesses is disastrous. Nearly 270,000 customers were in arrears on their bills at the end of last year. Across the country, many families are choosing between heating their homes and feeding their families. The impact on businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, has also been ruinous. Many otherwise viable businesses are facing the prospect of closure simply because they cannot afford to keep the light or heat on. Just €26 million out of a total budget of €1.2 billion has so far been drawn down from the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS. This low take-up is evidence that the scheme is simply not fit for purpose. It is time the Government tried a new approach. A targeted energy price cap would cap the price of average energy usage for both businesses and households. This would mean that everyone would get their essential energy needs at a reasonable and affordable cost. Those who use in excess of that amount would pay more. Wealthier households would not disproportionately benefit and it would also incentivise energy conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">This is something that was introduced in Germany in December so we know it can be done. It would reduce prices and, crucially, provide security and certainty to households and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The Government introduced electricity credits at the start of this crisis because it said it was the quickest way to get supports to people. Now, more than a year later, the Government has had the time to design a better model of supports. A targeted price cap is the best way to support businesses and households, but it must be accompanied by a windfall tax to ensure energy companies cannot price gouge while the cap is in place. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, first promised a windfall tax in August and the EU signed off on one in September. Many other EU countries, including Germany and Spain, to name just two, have introduced a windfall tax. Why is the Government dithering?</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Tomorrow, the Social Democrats will table a motion calling for targeted energy price caps. Will the Government support our motion and introduce them? When will we see the long-promised windfall tax finally introduced?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_10">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">I thank the Deputy. I want to acknowledge the enormous pressure a lot of people, families and businesses are under because of the rise in energy costs. We have seen a dramatic rise in energy costs over the past two years, almost entirely driven by international factors, and exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and other factors related to it. In fairness, a lot has been done by the Government to help people with the rising cost of living. I might read them out later, but I can identify 25 individual measures alone that the Government has introduced only in the past year or so to help people with the cost of living in lots of different ways. We have always acknowledged that it is impossible to fully insulate everyone from the rising cost of living, though we strive to insulate those on the lowest incomes and those dependent on pensions and social welfare to the greatest extent that we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The Deputy mentioned the fact that some energy companies will make very large profits this year. They made very large profits last year and will do so again this year because of the high cost of energy. In many cases, they will make profits they never thought they could make. That ranges from the Corrib gas field to oil and petrol refineries and State-owned companies like the ESB. That is not fair, right or okay, and we will act on it. When it comes to State companies making very large profits, we can use the dividend system to take a special dividend and use the money to help families and businesses with the cost of living. When it comes to private companies, we have a windfall tax. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, updated the Cabinet on that earlier today so there will be such a tax on energy companies. I do not want to give too much detail, but the plans are very well advanced and hundreds of millions of euro will come in from a windfall tax on energy companies. That is money we did not factor into the budget for this year. It is additional funds we can use to help defray the cost of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> When it comes to businesses, we acknowledge that the take-up of TBESS was a fraction of what we thought would be. The Ministers, Deputies McGrath and Coveney, are working on enhancements to that scheme so that more businesses qualify for it and they get larger amounts. We acknowledge that the take-up and drawdown of the scheme has been a fraction of what we thought would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> We are reluctant to introduce price caps because they are very hard to cost. Essentially, if we introduce a price cap, the Government is saying that this is the cap people have to pay and we will pay the rest no matter what it is. Even if it is limited and targeted, it is very difficult to work out what it will cost and there are big risks involved in that. It is essentially a contract for difference, which the Deputy will remember in respect of Anglo Irish Bank. While the Deputy gave examples of Germany and Spain, it is also something that the Truss government tried in Britain and it did not work out so well.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">I thank the Taoiseach. I welcome the indication that we are moving to a windfall tax, however late in the day. What is the timescale for the introduction of such a tax?</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Will that be retrospective? </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The Taoiseach spoke about the main energy companies and the extent of the profits they have been making. We know that in the first six months of last year, the ESB made profits of €390 million, yet it imposed three separate price hikes last year. The profits of Bord Gáis Energy went up by 74% in the first six months of last year, yet it increased electricity prices on four occasions and gas prices in five occasions. Does the Taoiseach not accept that it is time to call a halt? We need to introduce the windfall tax but we also need to ensure there are direct benefits for households and businesses from that windfall tax. We need to reach a point where energy bills are again somewhat affordable. No deals are available at the moment and we need urgent action on this.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">A windfall tax on energy companies is weeks away. I do not think we are late in the day because companies pay tax now on profits they made last year and last year only ended six or eight weeks ago. We will have that tax in place in the near future. It will be retrospective in the sense that the companies will pay it on the profits they made last year and will pay it again on the profits they make this year, so we will have two years of revenue coming in from that windfall tax. We will be able to use that to help businesses and households with the high cost of energy and the high cost of living. It will be a few months before we start seeing those gas and electricity prices fall but I believe we will start seeing them fall in a few months' time - first for businesses and. subsequent to that, for households.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> We do not have exact figures yet but we do anticipate that a number of State energy companies will record very high profits, with the ESB being one of those. There are two mechanisms we can use to recoup some of those profits. One is the special dividend while the other is the windfall tax. We intend to use those mechanisms to take that money back and make sure we can use it to help homes, families and businesses with the cost of living.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">Yesterday, I attended a powerful rally at Grangegorman organised by the students' union at TU Dublin in response to a racist attack on international students. Two hundred students came out to say that we will not stand for people being attacked because of the colour of their skin or where they come from. It is exactly what we need in response to the spate of violent racist attacks we have seen in the wake of the anti-refugee protests - no pandering to racism but standing up strong against it.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> It is the same spirit that will motivate thousands of people to participate in the Ireland For All solidarity march at Parnell Square at 1.30 p.m. this Saturday. It is now supported by almost the entire trade union movement; by migrants' organisations such as the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, the Irish Refugee Council and the Immigrant Council of Ireland; by anti-racist organisations like United Against Racism and Le Chéile; by feminist organisations like the National Women's Council of Ireland and Women's Collective Tallaght; by community organisations like Ballymun For All, Drimnagh For All and East Wall Here For All; and by football clubs and boxing clubs. The list goes on. They all understand the need to take a stand against racism and division. They know that in order to build a movement to force the Government to actually deal with the housing crisis, the health crisis and the neglect of our communities, we must stand united and that it only serves those who benefit from these crises to have people wrongly divided and wrongly blaming asylum seekers and refugees. </p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The Government has taken a very different approach. Last Wednesday, the Taoiseach told the Dáil that we should not play into those arguments. The very next day, he told the media that we need to be fair, firm and hard when it comes to migration. He spoke about people who come to Ireland with a false story or on false pretences. It was a shameful attempt to pander to anti-refugee sentiment and this shameful rhetoric has been matched with shameful actions. The Government has left over 100 people fleeing war and persecution sleeping on the streets in the context of an increase in racist violence. The Minister for Justice spoke inaccurately about people coming to our country illegally while speeding up deportations.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">It is not a mystery where this political rhetoric will end up, because all across Europe, Fine Gael's sister parties have done exactly the same thing in response to the rise of the far right. All that has achieved is to legitimise its arguments and allow it to shape its narrative and drive its rise further.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Thankfully, the thousands who will turn out on Saturday do not share the Taoiseach's approach. They know there are enough resources in this country for everybody to have a decent home, a decent job and a decent standard of living, and they want to see homes for all, healthcare for all, services for all and an Ireland for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Will the Taoiseach listen to them? Will he abandon the current strategy, combat misinformation instead of pandering to it and tackle the underlying causes of alienation, which give fuel to anti-refugee sentiment, by committing to building social housing, using vacant properties and providing quality, accessible public healthcare for all?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:25:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_39">Let me say at the outset that I do not believe there is any excuse for racism of any form, whether it is directed towards people who are new arrivals to this country, people who have been here for a long time or people who were born here. People should be judged by the content of their character and not the colour of their skin, full stop, and I do not think any of us, coming from any perspective, whether it is centre, right or left, should try to politicise the issue of racism or try to gain from it in any way. I certainly hope the Deputy will not be doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> We are facing, in Europe and in Ireland, an unprecedented refugee crisis, the likes of which we have never seen in this country. In the past year or so, we have accepted and welcomed maybe 100,000 people to Ireland, an absolutely huge number of people, most from Ukraine but others who have come from other parts of the world. By and large, we have been able to provide them with accommodation, food, shelter, heat and light, access to education and healthcare and, in many cases, access to employment too. I know it has not been a perfect response, but I am proud of the societal response from Ireland as to what we have managed to do in the past year. No country in western Europe, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, has accepted as many people from Ukraine as we have. Despite the enormous challenge, I believe we have done well it in the round and we should be willing to say that and to thank the Irish people and communities around the country, in particular, for the very warm welcome they have given people.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> It is a real struggle to continue to find more accommodation and there is no point in being in any denial about that. If, two years ago, we had had amazing foresight, known Putin was going to invade Ukraine and we had built a city the size of Waterford with 20,000 houses and apartments for people who might come here, that place would be full by now. That is the scale of the numbers coming in. We have to try to manage that as best we can, and we will.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> There are lots of people who will try to exploit the migrant crisis, for all sorts of reasons, on the far right and on the far left, and I will not be called out on that issue because I do not think it is right to conflate issues such as housing, healthcare, unemployment, crime, domestic violence or any of these things with migration. No matter what problem a country has, racists and the far right will blame that on migrants, and I think it is a mistake to conflate them. There are plenty of opportunities to have a go at the Government about any issue and I know the Deputy will take those opportunities, but he should not mix it up with an antiracism campaign. That is a mistake and I think he is playing into the hands of the far right in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">The Taoiseach says the far right and the far left will exploit the migrant crisis. I am not sure whether he has noticed, but the far right is organising protests outside the temporary, inadequate, emergency accommodation of asylum seekers. What is the far left doing? We are working with others to build a solidarity march to say that refugees are welcome and that these people are not responsible for the housing crisis. I have no idea what the Taoiseach is talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> The Taoiseach said people should not use this issue for political advantage and I agree. He will be talking to Senator Regina Doherty, who has spoken about people taking advantage of some of the “frailties in our system". He will be speaking to Fianna Fáil backbencher Deputy John McGuinness, who has called for a plan to move asylum seekers into a Kilkenny city hotel to be paused. He will be having a chat with himself, perhaps, about the use, very conscious, of the terms “fair, firm and hard”, which generated precisely the headlines he wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Ordinary people do not agree with the Taoiseach's Government. They disagree with it for the creation of the housing crisis and for the representation of developers, speculators and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">They also do not agree with those who try to exploit those divisions. </p>

          <p eId="para_52">It is absolutely right that people should stand up against racism. We are working on a new national anti-racism strategy and will have that quite soon. We will implement it and fund it. However, I do not think that anyone should use an anti-racism campaign to promote a particular political party or particular ideology and I do not think that should be done. I will keep on saying that whether the Deputy likes it or not. As I have always said, I believe migration has been a good thing for Ireland. It has been good for our economy, good for our public services and it has helped to enrich our culture as well but people do want migration to be managed properly. There is nothing wrong with people wanting migration to be managed properly. That means being fair with refugees who come here from abroad fleeing war and making sure they get the protection that they deserve, and having legal pathways to migration. A total of 40,000 work permits issued last year to people coming here as economic migrants legally but it does mean being firm with the minority of people whose stories are not true and who come here on false pretences, telling them that their application will be processed quickly and refused, and that they will be returned. There is nothing wrong with that and if the Deputy thinks that nobody should be returned home, even if their story is false, he should be honest about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">At the start of the year, a major incident was declared at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, because of the number of people presenting in the accident and emergency department. In response a protocol was agreed whereby a limited number of patients could be brought by ambulance to Ennis instead. A meeting was held on 17 January with the Minister for Health, HSE senior management and the management of UHL as well as Oireachtas Members from the area. The Taoiseach's attendance at the meeting was noted and very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> The acknowledgement by HSE management that UHL's model 2 hospitals such as Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's Hospital were underutilised was very welcome. At the meeting, I asked what additional resources would be provided to Ennis hospital in light of the new protocol and was told that a review would take place. It was implicit in the reply that those resources would be provided. Instead, all surgery stopped in Ennis for the month of January. Two newly equipped theatres lay idle and specialist staff were redeployed across the hospital. </p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I raised the under-resourcing of UHL with the Taoiseach's predecessor, Deputy Micheál Martin. I agree with him that it is not the Taoiseach's job to run a hospital but it is the Taoiseach's job to ensure that hospitals are adequately resourced within the constraints of national finances and that hospitals across the State are equally resourced. By any figures, UHL seems to be understaffed relative to the population of the region and relative to other regions and it is the Taoiseach's job to ensure that the existing resources are adequately managed. </p>
          <p eId="para_57"> Is the Taoiseach happy that the mid-west and UL Hospitals Group is adquately resourced relative to other parts of the State? If so, is he happy that those resources are being adequately managed? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_24">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_58">What we want to achieve in healthcare, guided by the Sláintecare plan is essentially three things. We want healthcare to be affordable, that is, free at the point of use for a lot of people and affordable for everyone; access where people are getting healthcare in a timely manner; and we also want good patient outcomes. I am not satisfied with where we are with that as a country and I acknowledge that we have a lot more work to do and not just in the mid west region but across the country as well. People will bandy about a lot of different figures as to which region has the most beds, the least beds or which budget and I am not sure we always compare like with like when we do that. However, since December 2019, or roughly since this Government took office, we have seen a very big increase in investment in healthcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">University Hospital Limerick, for example, has grown its workforce by more than 1,000 full-time staff since then, just two and a half years, and its budget has increased by 20%. A 96-bed inpatient ward block is under construction in Limerick. The Minister for Health turned the sod on that back in October. As I have indicated before, we need to start planning for further bed expansion in UHL because it will be needed. </p>
          <p eId="para_60"> In relation to Ennis, Nenagh and St. John’s hospitals, there has been a shift in policy. Our ambulance service is different from what it was ten or 12 years ago and we believe we can now safely bring patients directly to hospitals like Ennis, Nenagh and St. John’s if the patient is stable. That makes sense for many reasons I do not need to explain to Deputies. Unstable and severely ill patients go to the emergency department in Limerick while those who are sick but stable will go to Nenagh or Ennis. We acknowledge additional resources will be required in those centres if they are to see additional patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The medical assessment unit pathway for Nenagh came into force on Tuesday, 7 February and the pathway for Ennis Hospital came into operation on 9 January. The new pathway allows stable medical patients meeting agreed clinical criteria to be treated in the model 2 hospital rather than having to go to the emergency department in Limerick. We think that will make a positive change and a difference. It is envisaged that similar measures will be introduced in St. John’s Hospital in Limerick in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">Like the Taoiseach, I hope it will make a positive change but the change it did make was the cancellation of surgeries in Ennis, two theatres lying idle and specialist staff being redeployed. There is something badly wrong with the utilisation of the model 2 hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> The Taoiseach talked about figures and the Minister for Health talked about 1,000 people in the UL Hospitals Group. I received other figures yesterday saying just 60 of the 3,000-odd whole-time equivalent positions created in 2022 were in the UL group, notwithstanding the fact that UHL is the most consistently overcrowded hospital in the country. This time last year we learned there were no additional beds to be provided there, despite the fact they were being provided in less crowded hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> This has an impact on real people. I have a letter from a 78-year-old woman who presented at Ennis Hospital and was told that, because there was no orthopaedic consultant available, she had to go to Limerick. She was on a trolley in Limerick for days. That is just another statistic but it is a real life affected by the fact we are not utilising our model 2 hospitals in the region to the extent we can and should.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T14:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_65">I do not know exactly why surgery was cancelled in Ennis during that period. The Minister for Health is beside me and has said he will check that out. It could be that the hospital was simply full of medical patients. That happens, particularly during winter when the surgical wards have to be given over to medical patients because so many people come in with pneumonia, respiratory infections and other things. That is why surgery is sometimes cancelled and it is one of the reasons we want to develop surgical hubs and elective hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> The Deputy will know what is happening in Croom, for example, where there is elective and managed care only. One of the risks of using the medical assessment units more in Ennis and Nenagh hospitals is that if more medical patients are taken to those hospitals, surgical beds may be taken up by medical patients, thus requiring surgeries to be cancelled. That is something we always have to factor in and is one of the reasons we are moving towards surgical hubs and dedicated beds.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">It is not agreed. I ask for an adjournment of the patient safety Bill to next week. We all know this is important legislation that we need to get right.

The Minister knows, however, that this amendment regarding the time at which women who are diagnosed with cancer are told about the patient safety review has to be instituted in law. Otherwise, the Bill will not pass the Vicky test and we will not be able to support it. I ask the Taoiseach to please give a week to put in the amendment to be able to achieve this.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">A report published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> presents in very stark terms the recruitment and retention crisis in An Garda Síochána. One in four Garda stations has seen a drop in staff, and 42 stations have no gardaí permanently assigned to them. In my constituency of Dublin Central we have lost 30 gardaí in the past year. The truth is that the Taoiseach's Government has overseen a significant depletion in Garda numbers over the decade it has been in power. When it comes to recruitment, we have another case of the Government setting big targets and falling very short on delivery. There simply are not enough gardaí to adequately police some areas, despite the very best efforts of those working on the front line. This creates real worry for people that their communities are not safe and are not protected from crime. How will the Government now respond to this crisis and ensure that An Garda Síochána is staffed to the required level?</p>

          <p eId="para_125">An Garda Síochána is made up of sworn gardaí and Garda staff. We anticipate that both will increase in number this year. We have provided funding for more than 1,000 gardaí to be recruited this year. This will be enough to cover retirements and resignations, and will result in an increase in the total number of gardaí. While training was disrupted as a consequence of the restrictions related to Covid, the total number of gardaí who completed or began training last year was almost 500. We expect to see some of them coming through in the next few months.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">The average cost of rent in Ireland in December was €1,733 per month. This is according to the latest Daft.ie market report. We know that after tax, the take-home pay for a full-time worker on the minimum wage now stands at just €1,724 per month. This is nearly €10 less than the average monthly rent. We know that rents have more than doubled in the past decade and have jumped nearly 14% in the last year alone. Homes are now unaffordable for so many, and unavailable too as the market is chronically starved of homes. There are now just 1,000 or so homes across the country available for rent, according to Daft.ie. We know that everybody in the State is touched by the housing crisis. Last Thursday evening, we in the Labour Party put forward a set of eight emergency measures. We called on the Government to adopt these measures to enable the Government to urgently address the housing crisis and this chronic shortage of housing supply. It was unfortunate that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, did not even join us for that debate. We ask that the Taoiseach would now withdraw the countermotion to ensure we do not have a division in the House on the constructive proposals we are putting forward to address the housing crisis as an emergency measure.</p>

We should have data from the census and also the Residential Tenancies Board data when they come through. There is no doubt that a lot of people are paying very high rents and are struggling to pay them. This is why we brought in the rent credit, for which some 170,000 people have already applied. I encourage those who have not yet applied to do so. The Minister has put down his countermotion and there will be an opportunity to debate it in the House.</p>

The Attorney General is normally part of the visit to Washington D.C. with the Taoiseach, which is a very important visit. In a breach with that protocol up to now, the list today shows that the Attorney General will be a solo dignitary to Argentina and Chile.

I do not believe it is correct to say that the Attorney General always travels to Washington D.C. with the Taoiseach. It has happened in the past. In the past the Attorney General has not travelled at all, and in the past the Attorney General has travelled to other locations. I believe I am correct in saying that what the Deputy has outlined is not the case. I can only remember one occasion when the last Attorney General came to Washington D.C., so I do not believe the Deputy's point is quite accurate.</p>

One of my constituents is a 50-year-old private who has served for almost 29 years, including on seven overseas trips. He is a highly trained individual with level 3 qualifications, but is being forced to retire. It is ludicrous to replace him and to train another qualified person when this man is fit, capable and eager to retain his role. Retaining these experienced personnel is a key enabler in strengthening the capability of our Defence Forces. What is going to happen when the ever-depleting backbone of the Defence Forces becomes so rare that they cannot pass on their experience to new recruits? Since the extension of service was obtained for sergeants, the Department of Defence has been advocating for change, but the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform has been stalling on permitting this solution. I ask the Taoiseach to step in to ensure this happens. Is the Taoiseach aware that for the first time in more than eight years, the number of-----</p>

          <p eId="para_148">Morale is on the floor in An Garda Síochána. The issue is not compulsory retirement but people are flocking away from the job. I salute Garda Pat Kelly who recently finished his term in Carrick-on-Suir. The number of gardaí in Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cahir and Cashel is appallingly and frighteningly low. How far will the Government leave this go before it gives proper recognition and support? I refer to boots on the ground, not officials in offices, bodycams or anything else. We need members of the force. An Garda Síochána in Cahir recently held a magnificent party for senior citizens. It was a wonderful community event, which has been held every year. This is the 24th year. Garda numbers are needed in order to cover each other. In Carrick-on-Suir, for instance, there is only enough gardaí to fill one roster, not to mind three or four. It is a frightening situation, and it is so unfair to the gardaí who, by and large, do an excellent job. I support them always, but they need the resources and the numbers to be safe and to keep the community safe.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I appreciate that gardaí all over the country are under a lot of pressure. As our population increases, we need to increase the number of gardaí as well. The number of gardaí is now over 14,000, up from 12,800 back in 2015 when it was at its lowest in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Funding is available to recruit 1,000 new gardaí this year. There will also be additional Garda staff. It is reasonable to point out that of the 14,000 sworn gardaí in An Garda, approximately 100 resigned last year. That is a resignation rate of about 1%. In the modern world, where people tend not to have jobs for life in the way they did, a 1% resignation rate in an organisation is well below average.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">Is the Taoiseach aware, despite what one might be led to believe, that the size of the national herd in Ireland is the same size now as it was when we joined the European Union 50 years ago? In that time, emissions of greenhouse gases have increased exponentially in other sectors in Ireland. The demand for meat and dairy produce has also increased exponentially around the world. If it is not met from Ireland, it will be met from elsewhere, notably, South America. What has changed is that Irish farmers have incurred huge debts as a result of being encouraged by successive Governments, of which the Taoiseach was a member, to move from beef to dairy. Many farmers invested vast amounts of money, encouraged by the Government and paid out by the banks, that they now owe. Does the Taoiseach understand their frustration as we now talk about culling a national herd back to numbers less than when we joined the EU? They feel they are being scapegoated for other sectors.</p>

Farmers who made the significant investments the Deputy talked about have been supported by the State through targeted agricultural modernisation scheme grants, and other supports in those areas, in order to be able to produce that food more sustainably into the future. We will continue to support our agriculture and farming sector in doing that.</p>

A huge number of working families are still feeling the brunt of the cost-of-living crisis. I urge the Taoiseach to retain the universal measures and supports the Government put in place, whether these are the energy credits, excise on fuels, childcare, tax credits and so on.

          <p eId="para_158">I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of the cost of living. We have seen inflation slow in the past few weeks. It is easing but there is a big difference between inflation slowing down and the cost of living going down. The cost of living is not going down but is still rising, which is hurting many families and people. We have not made any decisions yet. We will do so over the course of the next few days and sign off on them at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting. The Deputy's point is well made that we need targeted measures for those who need the most help, in addition to universal measures, because there is not a family in Ireland that is not being impacted in some way by the high cost of living.</p>

The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, recently presented our fifth and sixth periodic reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child at the UN, the response to which issued just last week. In that response, the committee recommends that the State reviews relevant legislation, including the Disability Act, to bring it in line with a human rights-based approach to disability, particularly with regard to the definition of "disability" and with due regard to the needs of Roma and Traveller children. In response to that recommendation, does the Government plan to review the Disability Act 2005? If so, when might such a review happen?</p>

Meath people travel longer and farther distances than people in any other county. They are in a commuter hell. We have been promised a rail line for 20 years and, shockingly, even at this stage, no money has been set aside or ring-fenced for this project, and we are being asked to wait for potentially another 16 to 19 years before the rail line is built.

We have a shocking transport service in west Cork, and everybody depends on a car. Many of our younger people are trying to get a driving test and now the waiting list is seven months for them as they try to get on with their lives for work or for other reasons. I brought this issue up with the previous Taoiseach and failed to get anywhere. I am pleading with the new Taoiseach to try to intervene to get a second driver tester appointed to Skibbereen. It is a huge area. We are talking from Ballinhassig out west to Skibbereen, obviously, up into Beara and the Mizen Head and Sheep's Head peninsulas, a huge area to cover with one tester.

They want to be able to stay on when they turn 60 but the current rules do not provide for this. All other county council staff, as the Taoiseach knows, can stay on until 70 years of age. It is widely known that retirement age is only 55 for these firefighters and an annual medical has to be passed for them to stay on, which is totally understandable. If they fail, naturally enough they have to retire and the limit is 60 years of age. We are facing a crisis in the emergency services. Can the Government consider extending the retirement age across the country, once staff pass their medical, to at least 63 or 64?</p>

          <p eId="para_177">That is something we are examining. As I said earlier, I have never been a big fan of rigid or compulsory retirement ages if people are fit and healthy and are able to pass a fitness test. Why would we not allow them to stay on, particularly at a time when we are finding it so hard to get staff across society and the economy because of full employment? It might have been different ten or 15 years ago when unemployment was high and we were trying to create opportunities for young people but there is no sector of our economy or society that is not struggling to get staff because of full employment. That makes us rethink our attitude to allowing older people or even not so old people to work for a bit longer.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_179">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for a public inquiry into collusion between British State forces and other persons, between 1968 and 1998, to commit, assist, or prevent prosecution of, offences, including murder, in the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">We in Aontú are happy to be able to move this Bill in the Dáil. It is an important Bill for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> An incredible number of innocent people have lost their lives due to British violence, British murder and British collusion in Ireland, North and South, for well over 50 years. In many of these situations, there have been no investigations whatsoever. In many of these situations, there have been cover-ups of the murderers' actions, both North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> There is a generation who are coming towards the end of their lives who are desperately seeking justice and desperately seeking the truth of what happened to their loved ones. Indeed, in many cases, that search for truth and justice has become intergenerational with grandchildren taking up the work of trying to achieve justice for their loved ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> It is an incredible situation that we have in some cases even those who perpetrated these murders finding that their career prospects improved and that their careers benefited. The danger is that we are at a crux. We are at a crossroads. We are in a really important stage right now in Ireland, North and South, because people know the British Government is seeking to bring through the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill. That legacy Bill, if enacted, would, in effect, allow people to get away with murder. The legacy Bill is a continuation of the policy that saw British state forces kill Irish citizens and British state forces collude in covering it up. In fact, that is what the legacy Bill looks to do today. It looks to cover-up those murders, in some cases up to 50 years later.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> It is important that the Irish Government does not stand idly by regarding the Bill. The Government has been weak in standing up to the British on the Bill. I encourage the Government to state on the public record that it will bring the British Government to the European Court of Human Rights if the British Government proceeds with a Bill that is in direct contravention of European law in terms of people's human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The Government should set the record straight, leaving the British in no confusion whatsoever that if they proceed down this shocking route of the legacy Bill, it will meet the full efforts of the Irish State, legally, diplomatically and politically, to prevent them from proceeding with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I have gone on the record as saying that if the British Government proceeds with the legacy Bill, I, as an Aontú TD, will have no option but to name people who were involved in the murder, for example, of the 14 civil rights marchers on Bloody Sunday.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> The Taoiseach and the Government will be aware of the hundreds of murders attributed to the British state forces. I refer to murders and massacres such as: the Dublin and Monaghan bombings; Bloody Sunday; the Ballymurphy massacre; the Springhill massacre; the murders of the Miami Showband members; the murders of the O'Dowd and Reavey families; and the murder of Denis Mullen, the father of Aontú councillor, Denise Mullen. These are all shocking and heart-breaking murders that happened in our country over that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> It is incredible that there has been no comprehensive investigation in all of this. We have situations, especially in the murder triangle where the Glenanne gang, which was a group of loyalist thugs worked hand-in-hand with the RUC and with British military in killing well over 120 Irish people in that small area, yet there has been no proper investigation of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> The Aontú Bill, if passed, would allow for a commission of investigation to be set up in this State that would be allowed to compel witnesses in the South of Ireland. It would have the power to take evidence from people outside the State. It also would have the power to consider information collected from other published state investigations from outside of the southern State.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> We are looking for a similar Bill to be passed in the North of Ireland, in Stormont, which would allow for the investigation to have compellability in both jurisdictions of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I ask the Taoiseach to take this issue seriously. This is a train coming down the line currently that will impact significantly on hundreds of Irish families who have been significantly wronged by the British state. The Bill offers us an opportunity to provide some level of justice to those people.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">As I noted to the President of the European Parliament earlier this month, one of the necessary ingredients to create change in the world is to speak honestly with our friends. I believe this honesty is needed now more than ever from the EU and the international community in its engagements with Israel, as Israel heaps injustice after injustice on the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_221"> Political leaders have, I believe, a responsibility to name Israel's aggression for what it is - an apartheid regime. Equivocation on calling out this violent system of apartheid is failing everyone as Israel's new administration lurches even further to the right.</p>
            <p eId="para_222"> In a television address, President Herzog warned at the weekend that Israel is on the brink of constitutional and social collapse as the ultra-right coalition sets its sights on the judiciary. Earlier that same day, the prime minister told a meeting of his government that he wants to strengthen illegal settlements and the security cabinet announced its plans to authorise nine illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Prime Minister Netanyahu's so-called reforms of the judiciary will significantly interfere in the courts' ability to overrule a cabinet decision that seeks to so brazenly break the law. These are not the actions of a democratic state.</p>
            <p eId="para_223"> It remains my firm view that Government must introduce and support the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018. This is now a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">I also want to raise the issue of Palestinian rights. Indeed, two weeks ago, I called on the Government to take a strong stance in defence of Palestinian rights. Conditions have worsened since, as we have seen the new far-right Netanyahu government in Israel, which took office at the start of the year, take even further steps to trample on the rights of the Palestinian people and, indeed, take further steps to undermine democracy in Israel also, with concerning plans to meddle with the judicial system. Indeed, we saw at the weekend a mass demonstration of nearly 100,000 people outside the Knesset protesting against plans to undermine the independence of the judiciary there.</p>
            <p eId="para_225"> The same Israeli Government has introduced draconian security clampdowns in Palestinian areas in Jerusalem and the West Bank and we have seen the expansion of illegal settlements with reports of 5,000 new settler homes being planned. It appears the current government has no interest in a two-state state and, indeed, no interest in pursuing peace. The state itself in Israel, it appears, has been captured by the far right and we have seen appalling deaths already. At least 40 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by army fire this year alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_226"> I am asking how can Ireland, and the EU indeed, maintain trade relations with a country that is carrying on like this. Will the Taoiseach and his Government take on Senator Francis Black's Bill to ban the import of goods from illegal settlements and from occupied territories, as we, in Labour, and others across the Opposition have called for?</p>

            <p eId="para_227">Every nation-state has an obligation to protect and maintain its borders; so too do the 27 member states of the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">In this context, I wish to ask the Taoiseach about his attendance at the special European Council meeting last week, where the issue of migration was addressed. It seems this issue has risen to the top of the EU agenda, as it has in Ireland. I understand a substantial package of new measures to deal with illegal migration was agreed by EU leaders, including the provision of EU funding to improve border protection capabilities and infrastructure. President Ursula von der Leyen talked about strengthening our external borders. Of course, EU nation-states have a moral and legal obligation to shelter those fleeing war and persecution. We also know that legal migration benefits our economies, among many other things. However, people are now asking for appropriate measures to be taken to speed up the determination of international protection applications, to ensure deportations actually take place, to deal with applicants coming from so-called safe countries of origin and to address the problem of applicants losing or destroying their travel documentation. What approach did the Taoiseach take at last week's special EU Council meeting?</p>

            <p eId="para_229">Israel is involved in a brazenly naked illegal occupation of Palestinian land and territory. This week, its cabinet authorised further illegal settlements on land that, under international law, is designated for the Palestinians. In the first month of this year, 50 Palestinians died in what was the deadliest month we have seen in decades, with the Israeli army running constant military raids into Palestinian territory, as they did last year. International human rights organisations have said, categorically, that the entire apparatus of the Israeli state has been operating on an apartheid basis against Palestinians since its foundation. Will the Taoiseach explain why the EU and our Government does nothing about this? Will he explain to me, to the world and to the Palestinians why the EU says that any and all means must be used to support the Ukrainian people in their fight against the illegal occupation of their country, but not a thing is done to support the Palestinians in their fight against the illegal occupation of their land and territory, the crushing of their right to self-determination, the apartheid system that is obnoxious to international law and to human rights and the 17-year-long siege of Gaza? The murder, oppression and persecution goes on and nothing is done. No sanctions are imposed. Will the Taoiseach explain the double standards?</p>

            <p eId="para_230">The Taoiseach said earlier in reply to me that nobody should be trying to make political gain out of migration. Will he distance himself from the conclusions of the European Council meeting and from Deputy Haughey's comments just now? The meeting represented a further hardening of the fortress Europe policy. The tone was set by the hard-right government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Italy, followed by the so-called centre right. There was agreement on reinforced co-operation on search and rescue missions in the central Mediterranean, a reference to the activity of NGOs that have saved the lives of people who would otherwise drown as a result of fortress Europe policies. A total of 25,000 people have died in the past nine years as a consequence of fortress Europe, which is being strengthened and strengthened. Over the past eight years, the aggregate length of fences at the EU's external borders has gone from 315 km to more than 2,000 km. There has been no attempt to address the illegal and violent pushing back of refugees into the ocean where they could drown. Will the Taoiseach reject this fortress Europe policy, which serves the interests of nobody?</p>

            <p eId="para_231">The crackdown on asylum seekers announced at the EU summit last week was based solely on the narrative of the far right. These are not my words or the words of any radical socialist; instead, they are the words of a colleague of the Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil MEP, Barry Andrews, and he is right. When I made the point in this House last week that the Government's failures on housing were a gift to the far right, the Taoiseach urged me to consider my language. The next day he flew to Brussels and said that the EU needed to be "fair, firm and hard" on the asylum issue. He gave himself a get-out-of-jail card by saying the EU needed to be hard on the traffickers, but that was the small print. It was not the headline and a man of the Taoiseach's experience would know, or have a pretty good idea at the very least, what the headline was going to be. Given that he is careful with his language, will the Taoiseach admit to the House that this was a dog-whistle?</p>

            <p eId="para_232">Has the Taoiseach received clarity from the British Government regarding the concerning Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the recently proposed roll-out of the electronic travel authorisation, ETA, scheme for third country nationals crossing the Border? I have grave concerns about this proposal. The Border is already too hard. We cannot have a situation where people travelling across Ireland could be subject to visa requirements. This is an affront to the Good Friday Agreement and would cause untold damage to community, societal and business relations on the island. My colleague, Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, tabled a motion in the Seanad, which received unanimous support, condemning the introduction of the electronic travel waiver for non-British citizens. If introduced, ordinary men and women who wish to travel to the Six Counties, be it for work, tourism or for study, will be expected to apply under ETA. The policy is both absurd and offensive. Will the Taoiseach assure us that no new restrictions on the free movement of people on this island will be introduced?</p>

            <p eId="para_233">The issue of migration is sensitive and we all should be careful in the way we speak about it. It is important that we do not call one another names. We must speak respectfully on the issue without labelling people with certain names. Both extremes of the political spectrum seem to be ramping up tensions in this regard. Middle Ireland wants to help people who are fleeing war, violence and famine, but they also want to be able to differentiate between those who need help and those who do not. On the radio last week, the Taoiseach mentioned he wanted the length of the process to be reduced to six to eight weeks. It takes 80 weeks currently for applications to be decided on. Some people are waiting 14 years for their application to be processed. The Taoiseach said he did not know how many people were being deported because such information is not collected. Is this the case and, if so, is this the right way to proceed with this?</p>

            <p eId="para_234">When the Taoiseach answers the Deputies' questions, in particular those of Deputies Haughey and Tóibín, will he explain the complications for a person seeking sanctuary in Ireland coming from Eritrea, for example, where they do not have the capacity to get a passport in the way we do, or a person fleeing persecution in Afghanistan, where passports have not been issued since 2021, or a person arriving to Ireland from Georgia fleeing on the grounds of LGBT persecution, or a person from a place where we have not given any working visas to? There is a complexity to this and there is dog-whistling under the guise of speaking on behalf of middle Ireland. The people of Ireland are very decent but we need to understand the complexities and streamline the process to make it easier for people coming here, particularly from regions of the world where it is far more difficult to access the resources we have at our disposal in Ireland.</p>

I have yet to see evidence of that but I will check her remarks in March to see if she does so.</p>
            <p eId="para_236"> I agree that we must support a two-state solution and we continue to do so. We support the right of Palestinians to their independence. We oppose the settlements and the expansion of the existing settlements, and anti-democratic forces, whether they are in Israel or Palestine.

These conclusions were supported by centre-left Governments, the Party of European Socialists and the European Green Party in government. For my part, I supported the conclusions on behalf of the Irish Government. I also made the case for legal pathways, which is something we in Ireland do better than other countries. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, at which I was the Minister last year, issued a record number of 40,000 work permits to economic migrants who wanted to come here and who we wanted to come here. When there are legal pathways to migration, that is the big door. We should have a big door when it comes to migration-----</p>

            <p eId="para_260">-----but we also need controls as well. I do not agree with the view that we should have no controls at all or have no nations or borders. Those who have that view should be honest about it and not try to cover up that they do not believe in any returns or any borders. They should be honest about that if that is their view.</p>
            <p eId="para_261"> As the Deputy rightly pointed out, my reference to being hard was specifically in reference to traffickers. We need to be hard on traffickers. That is what I said in Brussels, what I said on Sunday and what I am saying again here today. I do not see any reason to misrepresent it. The Deputies must have their own agenda if they are trying to misrepresent those words. I agree that we all need to be careful in the words we use. Those of us who are politicians in the centre ground need to be willing to talk about migration. We have been a bit afraid to talk about it, quite frankly, for the past number of years. If those of us in the centre ground do not talk about migration, we will allow the far right and the extreme left to dominate the debate in this regard and that will not be good. That is why we need to talk about it and find ways to talk about it carefully but sensibly as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_262"> In relation to the electronic travel authorisation, I raised this matter with Prime Minister Sunak when we had our phone call a couple of weeks ago. We have not met in person yet but I hope to do so soon. I expressed our very strong concerns about the impact this could have on third country citizens. It will not apply to Irish or British citizens but could certainly apply to EU citizens living in Ireland, North or South, and non-EEA citizens living in Ireland, North or South, and could make their lives difficult. They could inadvertently find themselves breaking the law in some circumstances just by crossing the Border. We have real concerns about that and would seek to have those allayed.</p>
            <p eId="para_263"> On the issue of deportations, approximately 700 orders have been issued since September. I do not know the exact figure of the numbers of people who have been affected but they are very small. What I am told is that in most cases where somebody has a deportation order served, they will either return to their home country or go to another country of their own volition. Very rarely does a deportation have to be effected. Some people also just disappear into the system and that makes them very hard to trace.</p>
            <p eId="para_264"> Deputy Gannon mentioned individual countries. In the context of this debate, it is probably not a good idea to mention or list individual countries. I have been advised not to do so by people in the past and I think that should work in all directions. To be frank, I can understand-----</p>

            <p eId="para_274">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> The Mulvey report, Dublin's North East Inner City: Creating a Brighter Future, which was published in February 2017, contains recommendations for the social and economic regeneration of Dublin's north-east inner city. The report has been further supplemented by the north-east inner city strategic plan 2020-2023. Implementation of the Mulvey report and the strategic plan is overseen and progressed by the programme implementation board. The board meets on a monthly basis and its members include representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, business and the local community. The board is assisted in its work by six subgroups comprised of Departments and agencies, and community representatives. These subgroups look at enhanced policing; maximising educational, training and employment opportunities; family well-being; enhancing community well-being and the physical landscape; substance use, misuse and inclusion health; and the alignment of services. </p>
            <p eId="para_276"> Officials from the Department of the Taoiseach work closely with the board, the subgroups and the dedicated programme office based on Sean McDermott Street. The chairperson of the programme implementation board reports to an oversight group, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach. Membership of the oversight group is comprised of senior civil servants across Government Departments and agencies who are actively engaged with the work of the north-east inner city initiative. This group ensures strong and active participation by all relevant Departments and agencies and deals with any barriers or issues highlighted by the board. Following the recent resignation of the chairperson of the board, arrangements will be made for the appointment of a new chairperson and I will advise the Government of a nominee in due course. In the interim, the work of the board will continue with the aid of the Department of the Taoiseach. The Government is committed to ensuring that the programme implementation board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfil its ambition. From 2016 to 2022, inclusive, the Government provided over €38.2 million in funding for the initiative. In 2022, funding was increased by €1 million to provide €7.5 million for the initiative and the Government has committed a further €7.5 million for this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_277">I have raised the need to review this initiative with the Taoiseach's predecessor, the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, and I raise it again with the Taoiseach at this juncture. We need to assess in real terms what progress has been made. The review needs to also include the need to expand the boundaries of this initiative because only one section of the north inner city is actually covered. Other areas which have been just as affected by poverty, drugs and the whole gangland phenomenon have been left outside of its scope. This has caused a real problem right across communities. I argued back in the day that all of the north inner city needed to be included. I believe that remains the case. I hope a proper thorough and independent review of the initiative will occur. The north inner city community coalition, a very broad-based coalition, has, I understand, written to the Taoiseach. It wants to meet him to talk about the appointment of a new independent chairperson. It is important that the chairperson is independent. I understand the Taoiseach has not yet undertaken to meet this group. Will he meet it?</p>

            <p eId="para_302">I have two specific questions. Has the Taoiseach decided who will take over as chair of the north east inner city programme implementation board since the resignation of Michael Stone? He said he will announce the nominee in due course. Can he give us a timeline and some indication as to who it will be?</p>
            <p eId="para_303"> I would also like to raise an issue with the Taoiseach on behalf of my Labour Party colleague in Dublin Central, Senator Marie Sherlock. She has asked what the Government is planning to do about the severe shortages of preschool and early years places in the area. Research undertaken by Young People at Risk, YPAR, a group of childcare professionals, community groups and others under the auspices of the north east inner city task force, has found that one in four children in the north east inner city have no preschool place. Can the Taoiseach indicate what money will be put in place for the area to deliver new childcare and early years places?</p>

            <p eId="para_304">I believe we are now six years into the north east inner city task force following the Mulvey report and €38 million has been spent. Where is the record of achievement? Deputy McDonald asked for a review. I would like a review. The Taoiseach may remember that the reason the north east inner city task force was initiated to combat drug related crime, poverty and dereliction in the area. Six years later and with €38 million spent, what can be pointed to as a record of achievement? Young people are still being taken into the drugs industry - and it is an industry - not only in the north inner city but throughout Dublin. Dereliction remains a problem in the area. The boundaries are rather obscure. Last year, we had a conversation about O'Connell Street, which does not come under the north inner city committee's remit, which seems strange. Hardwicke Street, an area just outside the catchment, does not receive the same level of funding as the north inner city task force. The independence of the chair is an issue of utmost importance. There was an expectation that the Taoiseach would announce a process for the selection of a chair, in consultation with the community.</p>

            <p eId="para_305">Last week, the Taoiseach, in responding to Deputies Barry and Pringle, suggested that those who are pointing to the need to address the housing crisis were in some way giving succour to the far right. They were not; both Deputies were very clear about their position that refugees are welcome in this country. Does the Taoiseach accept that it is the case that where there is deprivation, neglected communities, a deep housing crisis with multiple generations living in one home and so on, it breeds alienation and is fuel for the likes of the far right to take people's righteous anger and turn it in the wrong direction? That is not to justify or excuse in any sense any racist or anti-refugee sentiments and so on. Rather, it is simply the reality that the likes of the far right prey on real social issues but then points people away from those responsible, that is, those at the top, towards those at the bottom.</p>

            <p eId="para_306">I thank Deputies for their questions. Regarding the programme implementation board and the appointment of a new chair, no decision has yet been made on the appointment of a chair but I would very much welcome any suggestions or nominations that Members may have, perhaps on a confidential basis. It can be difficult to approach people for these roles. The enthusiasm for taking on this kind of work is not what it used to be for all sorts of obvious reasons, but any suggestions from Deputies would be dealt with confidentially and welcomed.</p>
            <p eId="para_307"> I reiterate that the Government is fully committed to the important work that has been under way in Dublin's north east inner city to oversee the long-term social and economic regeneration of the area. The north east inner city programme implementation board and subgroups, established following the publication of the Mulvey report and which comprise Government Departments and agencies alongside community representatives, will continue this work and ensure sustained momentum for the many initiatives being driven under the board's programme of work. Arrangements will be made for the appointment of a new chairperson for the implementation board. As I mentioned, I will advise the Government of a nominee in due course. In the interim, the work of the board will continue with the assistance of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> Regarding the letter to which Deputy McDonald referred, I have not yet seen it. I am sure the Deputy's inbox is as big as mine and on any given day, I could receive 100 emails and letters, if not more, coupled with requests for meetings. They will all be responded to as soon as we can get to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_309"> I was asked about childcare and school provision. The early learning and care component of the Sheriff Street crèche and after-school education support programme, formerly on Sheriff Street, closed after the landlord informed the service in May 2020 that the lease of the premises would not be renewed after 30 June. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is looking at the wider implications for capacity in the area. However, affordable alternative premises have proved difficult to secure. Several options have been explored by the service but were found to be unsuitable in terms of size and affordability. The Dublin city childcare committee, in consultation with other stakeholders, is continuing to consider options in the area to minimise the risk that local families will not be able to secure appropriate early learning and care placements, should the need arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_323">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 25, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_324"> The Cabinet committee on housing met on 30 January. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for 9 March. The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of Housing for All. The quarter 4 2022 progress report was discussed at the most recent meeting of the committee, and was subsequently approved by Cabinet and published on 7 February. This is the sixth quarterly report under Housing for All and details further progress in the Government's commitment to increase the number of homes for our citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_325"> Just under 30,000 new homes were completed in 2022, not including student accommodation and derelict homes brought back into use. This exceeded the target of 24,600 set in Housing for All and represented the largest annual delivery of new homes in over a decade. The quarter 4 progress report outlines our progress in accelerating the supply of homes, while bringing about fundamental reform in the delivery of housing in our country. The Government is now focused on the 2023 target of 29,000 new homes, and we hope to exceed that.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> Through Project Tosaigh and Croí Cónaithe, we are enhancing the financial viability of homes which already have planning consent. The quarter 4 report details initiatives which will accelerate the adoption of modern methods of construction, MMC, which has the potential to improve construction sector productivity, innovation, speed of delivery, sustainability and, ultimately, cost. Over 30 sites have been identified for accelerated delivery using MMC, involving over 1,500 new social homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_327"> We are also making progress on vacancy and dereliction. In 2022, over 2,300 vacant social homes were brought back into active use. On 30 January, the Government published a new vacant homes action plan which will return as many recoverable vacant properties back to viable use as soon as possible, while also revitalising communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_329">For a very long time, some of us campaigned for the Government to introduce a policy of using public money to buy the homes of people threatened with eviction. Very slowly, and not very consistently, the Government has started to do that. It is not doing enough. A cohort of people is not getting any benefit from this, namely, those who happen to be over the social housing income thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_330">This is because the Government will not sanction the purchase of homes if these people are not on the social housing list. These people are not entitled to HAP and, therefore, are in many cases in a worse position. I know of a family who are going to court for an enforcement order to evict them from the home in which they have lived all their lives. They have written to the Taoiseach and the Minister and they believe they will probably be living in their car with their two children by next week. These are working people who have paid their taxes and have always paid their rent. Will the Taoiseach do something about that?</p>

            <p eId="para_331">People need to know whether the Government's partial eviction ban will be extended after 31 March. We need to have a proper eviction ban such as the one we had during Covid. We know for a fact that the number one cause of homelessness is eviction from private rental accommodation. This is from Focus Ireland. We know that eviction bans work. They are not the full answer to the housing crisis but we saw the impact during Covid when the figures dropped from about 9,000 to about 6,000 before rising.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> We are heading towards having 12,000 people, almost 4,000 of whom are children, homeless. Will the Government commit that those people will not be evicted and we will have a proper eviction ban as long as this housing crisis lasts while we build social and affordable housing and use vacant properties?</p>

            <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_333">I have two questions on housing and planning policy. The Taoiseach will have seen the explosive allegations in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> by Mark Tighe reporting that ESB staff have been accused of seeking backhanders from companies to get works completed and new developments connected. We know there are significant delays in getting connections from the ESB for new developments. These are slowing down and obstructing delivery of new homes and other developments. The report said there was evidence of a payment of €10,000 agreed with an ESB engineer, among other such payments. This begs the question as to whether this is a common practice and if it extends to other public utility company. What does the Taoiseach and Government propose to do about it? Is An Garda Síochána involved? Will there be an investigation into this practice and will the Government set up a confidential reporting line so that those who may have been asked to make payments to speed up delivery of residential and other developments can report it without risking such developments?</p>
            <p eId="para_334"> The draft planning and development Bill is before the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for pre-legislative scrutiny but the draft seems to have removed the requirement for local authorities to reserve land for use as allotments for cultivation. Many of our councillors are seriously concerned about this deletion. Can the Taoiseach assure us that it will be addressed?</p>

            <p eId="para_335">In recent months, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage issued a circular allowing HAP residents at risk of homelessness to remain in their homes and the local authority to purchase their homes. This has been broadly welcomed and comes as a relief to many families. However, the implementation of this circular has varied from local authority to local authority. For example, one local authority has used the new initiative but has placed a five-year stipulation on a person's tenure for it to be available to him or her. Another local authority has not availed of the initiative as much as it is already on its way to meeting its social housing targets. Is it about time that the <i>ad hoc</i> implementation of this good initiative was regularised with specific guidance and criteria issued?</p>

            <p eId="para_338">The final progress report for 2022 does not include social and affordable rental or purchase output. This omission is incomprehensible. When will the Government publish these figures? The <i>Daft.ie</i> rent report for the same period shows new rents spiralling upwards to record highs. Spiralling rents are, of course, a consequence of Government failure to deliver adequate levels of social and affordable homes. At least one third of renters should not be living in privately rented accommodation and the private developer sector alone cannot deliver the volumes of homes to rent or buy at prices that working people can afford. Property price inflation will continue to rise without an adequate market intervention that meets that challenge head on. The Children's Rights Alliance has highlighted the lack of a specific focus on children or a dedicated plan that targets child and family homelessness in the Housing for All strategy. When will that be addressed? I had other questions but I do not have time to put them.</p>

            <p eId="para_339">I want to ask the Taoiseach about the number of homes that were completed in 2022. Significant data were published on this today. In his previous remarks, the Taoiseach repeated the claim that almost 30,000 new homes were completed last year. However, figures published today by Construction Information Services show that fewer than 24,000 homes were actually built. This figure is based on hard data compiled from the National Building Control Office, which certifies completions. This is a gap of 6,000. Does the Taoiseach agree that the hard data compiled by the National Building Control Office are highly reliable as it has a legal role in certifying house completions? How does he explain the gap of 6,000 for which there is no paper trail?</p>

            <p eId="para_340">According to <i>Daft.ie</i>, new rents in the past three months of 2022 were 13.7% higher than in the same period in 2021. Rents have increased to an average of €1,733 compared with an average rent in 2011 of €765. It is incredible that since Fine Gael took office in 2011, we have seen an increase in rents of 126%. The Taoiseach, his Government and his party have left a massive legacy to tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people who are struggling to pay rent. In my office, I see on a weekly basis people who have to migrate westwards - people who are leaving Dublin to live in Ashbourne, then move to Cavan and then move on to Leitrim because they cannot afford the rents. They are surfing a wave of rent affordability across the country. It is incredible that local authorities are only now looking at ways to identify vacant homes for the vacant home tax. Will the Taoiseach tell us when the vacant home tax be put in place?</p>

            <p eId="para_341">The <i>Daft.ie</i> report published yesterday shows that it now costs way more than €20,000 to rent for a year in Cork city. A generation that could not afford to buy its own homes now cannot afford to rent. After the publication of the report, Ronan Lyons said that "among the worst affected cohorts are younger adults, with the median adult age of leaving the parental home having grown almost 50% in the last decade." In other words, since shortly after Fine Gael came to power, if the median average age was 18, it is now close to 27, and if it was 20, it is now close to 30. Does the Taoiseach accept that his Government has let down the under-30s very badly indeed on this issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_342">I welcome the figures in the quarter 4 report. Regardless of what figures we look at, we see last year's performance on housing was better than any other year for some time. Certainly in terms of public housing, we are back to where we were in previous decades. In my constituency, there are sites off Oscar Traynor Road, Collins Avenue, St. Joseph's Hill, Parkview, Church of the Annunciation and Kildonan, all of which involve public housing on public land. However, where we are struggling is on sites like the Ballymun Shopping Centre site where there is a necessary commercial element and retail must be provided. Dublin City Council has gone out for expressions of interest. Given the changing interest rate market, this has proved challenging and I am not sure the interest that was there last year or the previous year is still there. We need the Land Development Agency to examine this site in partnership with Dublin City Council. We need both retail and housing built on it and we need the same action on the site as we see on many other sites.</p>

            <p eId="para_343">The Government finally moved on the issue of the rent tax credit and introduced a watered-down version of the Sinn Féin proposal. However, the requirement for the landlord to be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, excludes so many, including students. Will the Taoiseach clarify whether RTB registration is a requirement? This punishes renters for landlords not following the rules. Students under the rent-a-room scheme and digs-style accommodation are also excluded. This is particularly galling for parents when the Government promoted this heavily as its solution to the student housing crisis this year. The tax credit is also restricted to rentals in the State, meaning that a family in Donegal with a student studying in Derry is excluded as are students forced to study abroad because there is no place for them here. PhD researchers are also excluded as they are not recognised as workers. Parents and students are technically included but it seems that no effort was made to include them in practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_344">Will the Taoiseach urgently review this?</p>

            <p eId="para_346"> In respect of Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan's question about the tenant <i>in situ </i>scheme, that is a scheme the Government supports and I know the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage supports it very strongly. We are providing funding to local authorities for it and we need to push it and promote it more. One thing we are considering is an amendment to the Housing Act to put a positive duty on local authorities to assist people who may fall into homelessness because homelessness prevention is probably the most effective, nevermind cost effective, way of reducing the number of people who are homeless. If we put a positive duty on local authorities in that regard, we might see fewer people falling into homelessness and more properties being bought up by local authorities or approved housing bodies, as the case may be.</p>

            <p eId="para_352">We might have a chat afterwards and he can let me know where it is. We can certainly ask the LDA to take a look at it.</p>
            <p eId="para_353"> On the rent tax credit, it does cover students who are paying rent and where parents pay on their behalf, but it does not cover unregistered landlords. The difficulty with unregistered landlords is they should be registered. They are either not registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, or are not paying their own taxes, and that has to be regularised. I do not think we could have a situation where we pay the tax credit in respect of a property that is not registered. I think that for lots of reasons, we could not do that. It does apply only to people who are renting in the State. If they are renting in Derry, for example, it would be up to the Government in Northern Ireland to bring in a rent tax credit. There was a lot of time when Deputy Conway-Walsh's party could have done that, in fairness, but it did not. The same applies, obviously, to other jurisdictions too.</p>
            <p eId="para_354"> In respect of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's question, I did not see those figures out today. As I understand it, the figures that suggest we built close to 30,000 new homes last year come from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and there is no body we could say is more accurate than the Central Statistics Office when it comes to statistics. It is certainly not subject to political influence and does not spin statistics or anything like that. Where there are different numbers out there, I would tend to go with the ones from the CSO rather than from anywhere else, but the Deputy raises a legitimate question and I do not know what the discrepancy or difference is, so I will make inquiries about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_355"> We do not have the exact numbers for new social housing for 2022 yet, but the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, tells me it will be close to 8,000 new builds last year, which looks like it will be the highest number since 1975, and that is a very significant increase in the provision of new social housing. In most of our lifetimes, no government has built as much social housing as this one did last year, but we need to build more and we have a higher target again for this year and the year after.</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> As for the median age of people leaving home, I think I saw the report and, if I remember correctly, the median age now for people leaving home is 28. It was lower but it has gone up. Of course, the Government accepts responsibility for putting that right and we are doing that through the help-to-buy scheme and the first home scheme and also by increasing supply. As I have said before, just under 70% of people in Ireland own their own home, but that is not the reality for people who are in their mid-20s and mid-30s and we need to change that. At the heart of the Government's housing policy is a commitment to increasing home ownership again. We do not believe in the rent-for-life models other people believe in. We want to see home ownership increase, but for those who are renting, we want to make sure they have secure tenancies and affordable rents too.</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> Deputy Bacik mentioned the allegations in respect of the ESB. I only became aware of them through media reports at the weekend. I have been briefed since. I am seriously concerned about them. The ESB is a respected State company and a respected public body. I would not like to believe these things are true but they may well be true, and if they are true, it is a very serious matter. I have been briefed that the Garda is involved now, that a Garda investigation is under way and that a confidential phoneline is available for people to make reports. I encourage anybody, whether home builders, businesspeople or anybody who has information on this, to share it with the Garda because we need to get to the bottom of it very quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_358"> In respect of the eviction ban, or partial eviction ban if you prefer, we will make a decision on that in the next few weeks. When we took the decision to reintroduce it, we had hoped it would see the numbers of people in emergency accommodation fall, because they did fall during the period of the pandemic restrictions. That has not happened. Numbers have continued to rise and it shows many factors are at play when it comes to homelessness.</p>

            <p eId="para_360">Family breakdown is one and another, of course, is people being evicted from private rented accommodation. We are seeing a change in the profile of people who are homeless. It is quite different from what it would have been five, six or seven years ago and that is a factor too, but we will assess that over the next couple of weeks. It will remain the case that if somebody is not paying rent or is engaging in antisocial behaviour, that will be grounds for eviction. I do think we have a problem - it might be a small problem but it is a growing problem - of people who cannot move back into their own home. People might go away for six months or a year, maybe to Australia, Dubai or Britain, come back and find they cannot move back into their own apartment or house. That is a difficulty. It might be okay for six months but if it is extended for longer, I think it becomes a real problem.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Charlie McConalogue)<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_365">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> The Bill, which I am pleased to bring forward, legislates for two areas. The first part seeks to modernise the area of veterinary medicines and medicated feed. As Deputies may be aware, at EU level last year, we saw the implementation of two new regulations in this area. The Bill will reinforce those regulations in Irish legislation in a once-in-a-generation change.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">It shows our commitment to key objectives in the regulations, namely addressing antimicrobial resistance and protecting the supply of veterinary medicines and medicated feeds while supporting Irish farmers and businesses through this unique period of change.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> The second Part of the Bill provides through the amendment of the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act 1955 for the creation of a national fertiliser database which will collect data on import, sale, supply and use of fertilisers and allow for analysis of this data to assist in the administration of other departmental schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I take this opportunity to thank the stakeholders who have engaged with my Department during the past three years on the issues at the core of this Bill. I also thank the members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for their valuable work both through meetings with my Department and in particular their work on the pre-legislative scrutiny report. I believe the report’s recommendations that have been incorporated into the Bill, where possible, have helped to strengthen the Bill I put before the House today. I also wish to recognise the work of my own officials and the Attorney General and his office in the preparation of the Bill and in the very significant work and engagement to bring it to this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> As we all know, Ireland’s agrifood sector plays a critical role not only for the economy but also for hundreds of communities. It is our largest indigenous sector and is truly the lifeblood of rural Ireland. Total exports of agrifood products last year were estimated by my Department at €18.7 billion. This phenomenal success is driven by the farm families and fishing communities of Ireland who are the bedrock of the sector, which is the envy of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> This Bill and the matters provided for within it will play a key role in the success of our agrifood sector going forward. In January 2022, I enacted SI 36 of 2022, the European Union veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed regulations, to give effect to EU Regulation 2019/4 on medicated feed and EU Regulation 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products. This Bill provides for powers to make regulations on areas that these recent EU regulations left to be determined by national law such as the retailing of veterinary medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> The Bill will repeal the Animal Remedies Act 1993. It will provide for the introduction of a national veterinary prescription system, NVPS. This system, which is being developed by my Department, will position Ireland as a leader within the EU in terms of regulatory oversight on the use of veterinary medicinal products in food-producing animals. Ultimately, this will help us to protect human and animal health and our shared environment, provide us with the best opportunity to access new trade markets and increase the viability of our food-producing sector, thus protecting and supporting jobs in our economy and in rural Ireland in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> Tackling antimicrobial resistance, AMR, is accepted as being critically important to achieving the best public, animal and environmental health outcomes, achieving economic, environmental and socially sustainable development and ensuring food security. AMR is now a leading cause of deaths worldwide. It is incumbent on us all to address this problem. The European regulation is now a cornerstone to support the achievement of the objectives set in the European one health action plan and in the farm to fork strategy against antimicrobial resistance. The regulation recognises the important role of the animal health sector in addressing the one health challenge of antimicrobial resistance, which has been referred to as the silent pandemic. This Bill strengthens Ireland’s position in the global fight against AMR and supports a sustainable agrifood sector. Actions taken to improve animal health and prevent disease are key to reducing the use of antibiotics and effectively tackling antimicrobial resistance. These actions align well with Ireland’s national farmed animal health strategy, with one of the key enabling principles being prevention is better than cure. This Bill provides a wide range of measures to fight AMR and promote a more prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials in animals. These measures serve to protect public health, as well as animal health, by working to keep antibiotics as effective disease treatments into the future. Vets as the prescribers and, indeed, gatekeepers of antibiotics have a key role to play to promote their responsible use. The farming sectors have a responsibility to work collaboratively with their vet and other farm advisory professionals to ensure the best possible health outcomes for their animals, and to use antibiotics only when absolutely necessary. The growing understanding of the risks of AMR is among the key drivers for recent EU veterinary medicinal regulation change. AMR is a global health threat, posing significant challenges to human and animal health, and to the Irish farming sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The Bill also provides for the introduction of the new national veterinary prescription system, NVPS, and the collection and effective use of the data collected therein. This has the potential to provide local, national and international benefits across the sector to multiples of stakeholders. The system itself is a free-to-use digital online platform which is accessible from any desktop or mobile device which allows veterinary practitioners to record and issue veterinary prescriptions to their clients for veterinary medicinal products including medicated feed. The introduction of the NVPS will meet the Government's commitment under its digital strategy to introduce greater digital services to its citizens. It will assist with Ireland's national one health-one welfare, antimicrobial resistance and antiparasitic resistance programmes by identifying where and when particular medicines are being used and why, to what levels and in which animal species, information which was never previously available to the policy makers addressing these international disease issues. It will assist with the development and provision of farmer education policies on the effective and good use of veterinary medicinal products. With this education, it is expected that vets and farmers alike will prescribe and use less medication over time, ultimately resulting in huge financial savings to farming communities. It will also provide greater choice and control to the individual farmer on where they purchase their medications. It will help to develop the sustainability of the food producing farming community. The data will assist policy makers in identifying alternative medicinal options and practices from a farming perspective through detailing good farming and prescribing practices. Its introduction will simplify and reduce administrative burdens by digitalising cumbersome and labour-intensive manual prescription and dispensing processes. It will provide assurances to international trading partners that Ireland is at the forefront of safe food production with the highest level of regulation on the supply and use of medications in its food-producing animal population. It will aid Ireland with its EU regulatory veterinary medicinal products usage data submission commitments under the EU regulation and will also help with efficiently directing limited Department and other national resources when scheduling inspections or introducing national programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> I am committed to ensuring a competitive marketplace for the supply of all veterinary medicines and a continuation of the current routes of supply into the future. The importance of competition in the marketplace and protecting the choice of the farmer in where he purchases antiparasitic veterinary medicines is central to the work of my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> The Bill, when enacted, will also enable the collection and processing of information on the import, manufacture, sale, supply and use of fertiliser in the State. It will enable data related to fertilisers and lime to be collected from the point of import into the State, or manufacture for sale, to an end user. The climate action plan 2023, Food Vision 2030 and the EU farm to fork strategy have all set ambitious targets to reduce fertiliser use including reducing emissions associated with chemical fertiliser use by more than 50% by the end of this decade. There is also a need to improve water quality, especially in specific catchment areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_377"> This Bill is divided into three Parts. Part 1 of the Bill provides for standard provisions in relation to the Title and commencement of the Bill, including a commencement order for section 7, which relates to the establishment of a national database for the prescribing and dispensing of veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed, and also for the repeal of the Animal Remedies Act 1993 and certain provisions of other Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Part 2 details the regulation of veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed with section 4 providing the definitions for Part 2 of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_379">Sections 5 and 6 provide for restrictions on those who may issue a veterinary prescription to ensure only registered veterinary practitioners do so. The recent advice received from the Attorney General’s office brings clarity to certain issues regarding prescriptions raised in the pre-legislative scrutiny report. The Bill provides for persons permitted to dispense a veterinary medicinal product subject to a prescription. It also provides for the making of regulations in relation to the prescription and dispensing of veterinary medicinal products or medicated feed, including such areas as setting the maximum validity period of a veterinary prescription other than an antimicrobial, specifying the contents of a veterinary prescription, the emergency dispensing of veterinary medicinal products by pharmacists and, as recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, producing a list of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that can be dispensed in lieu of the product on the veterinary prescription.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> Section 7 provides for the establishment, maintenance and operation of a database, called the “national database” in the Bill, on which veterinary prescriptions and dispensing of veterinary prescriptions shall be recorded. This will be known as the NVPS. This section deals with the information held on the database, who it may be accessed by and shared with and the reasons for the processing of the data.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The explanatory memorandum that was published with the Bill contained an error in detailing section 5 where it stated “that all veterinary prescriptions shall be issued electronically and dispensed and recorded on or transmitted to the national database”. This detail should have been included in the explanatory memorandum at section 7. This section is necessary to give legal effect to the NVPS, to permit the collection of the data needed to operate such a system and to comply with the general data protection regulation, GDPR. The NVPS will also be utilised to assist in complying with Ireland’s obligations under Article 57 of EU 2019/6 on the collection of data on the usage of antimicrobials. I have provided for the introduction of the NVPS on commencement order, which will allow the necessary time to further develop the NVPS as necessary to facilitate the continuation of existing retail and supply chains of antiparasitic products. The use of the NVPS by prescribers and dispensers of veterinary medicinal products is a key tool in ensuring a competitive market for the supply of such products.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> Sections 9 to 26 provide for the rules on retail. The recent EU regulation states that retail of veterinary medicinal products is a matter for national law. The rules being introduced cover areas including the routes of retail of veterinary medicinal products to ensure they are retailed in an appropriate manner. The routes are detailed in the Schedule to this Bill. The labelling requirements of veterinary medicinal products that are subject to a prescription, or those that are retailed out of their original packaging, are detailed to ensure the correct information in relation to the supply and use of the product is clearly displayed. An application process is provided for the granting of a retailer’s licence to enable someone to retail veterinary medicinal products. The obligations that attach to such a licence, including training of retail responsible persons, are outlined. Rules on retailing on the Internet are provided for, along with powers to make further regulations in that area. Record-keeping provisions for those who are retailers, as well as a provision that retailing must only take place from a fixed premises, are detailed. The procedures around the special import licences that vets and wholesalers may avail of in certain circumstances are also covered in this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Sections 27 to 30 provide for the making of regulations on the possession, administration, advertising and storage of veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> Sections 31 to 34 provide for the making of regulations on the licensing of the importation of certain veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed in circumstances permitted under EU law, other matters that EU regulations left to national law and general provisions on licences and regulations made under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Sections 35 to 56 are enforcement matters. The provisions of these sections are adapted from the Animal Remedies Act 1993.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Turning to Part 3 of the Bill, which contains eight sections, the proposed legislation will amend the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act 1955 to provide for a register of fertiliser economic operators, a register of professional fertiliser end users and the establishment of a national fertiliser database and associated provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> Sections 57 and 58 provide definitions for Part 3 of the Bill, while section 59 provides a means for substances not considered fertilisers or feeding stuffs to be excluded from the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Section 60 provides for the application of a licence and the right to appeal if a licence is not granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Section 61 provides for the establishment of a fertiliser economic operator's register and a fertiliser end user register. It also provides for a national fertiliser database, which will encompass the registration of fertiliser economic operators and end users. Information on the manufacturing, import, placing on the market, making available on the market or sale, whether wholesale or retail, of fertiliser products will be included in the database.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Section 62 provides for the appointing in writing of such persons or class of persons as the Minister considers appropriate to be authorised officers for the exercise of the functions conferred on an authorised officer under this Part. This section also provides the powers for an authorised officer and details the specific circumstances in which an authorised officer can use their powers. It also provides the procedures for properly processing the information collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Section 63 provides for the prosecution of offences under this Part of the Bill and Section 64 provides for penalties for offences under the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_392"> The national fertiliser database will provide for accurate tracking of fertiliser sales along the supply chain. The recording of fertiliser sales data at farm level will facilitate traceability and monitoring of quantities and types of fertiliser used over time. Additionally, farmers can use this data to demonstrate compliance with any future voluntary industry sustainability or quality assurance initiatives. The data captured in the database will provide a solid basis for future policy interventions to support our environment and climate ambitions. It will assist farmers in improving nutrient use efficiency on their farms, thereby contributing to the key targets on fertiliser use under the climate action plan, and will facilitate improved compliance with nitrogen and phosphorous limits. Data from the database will also facilitate regulatory controls by my Department under Ireland’s nitrates action programme, nitrates derogation and the eco-scheme liming and reduced fertiliser options under Ireland’s Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan. </p>
          <p eId="para_393"> In time, checks that previously involved examining paper records supplied by farmers will be completed using information from the database. This will significantly reduce the administrative burden that would otherwise be placed on farmers. Establishing the database will also meet a commitment that Ireland made during negotiations with the European Commission to secure the current extension to Ireland’s nitrates derogation. At this stage all EU member states availing of a nitrates derogation have set up, or are in the process of setting up, a national fertiliser database.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> Under the Bill, anyone wishing to purchase fertiliser for professional use will have to register as a professional fertiliser end user, the vast majority of which will be farmers. Farmers or agents acting on their behalf will be able to register using the Department’s online portal, <i>www.agfood.ie</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> In response to recommendations made during pre-legislative scrutiny, I reiterate that this will be a simple process and will only be required once. Non-farmer professional fertiliser end users will have to apply to my Department for registration. Once registered, they will be assigned a unique identification number. Professional fertiliser end users will have to submit stocks of fertiliser on their farms or premises on dates to be agreed as part of the consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The pre-legislative scrutiny process raised the issue of purchase of fertiliser by sports clubs and organisations. The purchase and use of fertiliser in quantities sufficient for use on football fields and their environs is considered as a commercial use and sports clubs will be required to register as professional fertiliser end users. Beyond registration, it is not anticipated that there will be any burden placed on clubs, particularly if they do not hold stocks on site. The sale of fertiliser to sports clubs and organisations will be recorded by fertiliser merchants.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> Non-professional users of fertiliser, such as gardeners producing for their own use, will not be impacted by this legislative proposal. Businesses or individuals selling fertiliser must also register with my Department as fertiliser economic operators and will be required to submit information to the national fertiliser database as set out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> The Department has been engaging with fertiliser stakeholders over many months to ensure this process is as straightforward as possible. In this regard, retailers of fertilisers will have two options to supply their sales data. This information can be submitted through an application programme interface, API, which will allow sales data to be sent directly to my Department’s IT systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Alternatively, the information can be submitted manually through the Department’s online portal, <i>agfood.ie</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> The robust data sharing provisions in the legislation will allow the potential specific sharing of data with other bodies to achieve environmental and sustainability targets and will be fully in line with general data protection regulation, GDPR, and other data.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> In conclusion, I look forward to support for this important legislation that will provide many far-reaching benefits for farmers, public and animal health and welfare and the environment. I also look forward to the debate on Second Stage and other Stages of the Bill as it progresses through the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> I thank all who have contributed so far and officials in my Department for their work in bringing this legislation together. It is heavy and complex legislation, but it is important we progress it given its significance. Both elements of the legislation involve the daily lives of farm families and, therefore, it is important that we continue to offer as much clarity as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#MattCarthy" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_403">EU Regulation No. 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products had been due to come into effect in January 2022. I first raised concerns about the transposition of that regulation with a predecessor of the Minister in July 2020 after some concerns had been raised with me and other Deputies by stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> At that time, a response to a parliamentary question from the then Minister stated that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_405">The specific rules will be determined by National law and it is the intention of my Department to provide for Responsible Persons who operate within the Licensed Merchant sector to continue to have a role in the dispensing of veterinary medicinal products as provided for in the current legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Of course, as time passed, the responses of successive Ministers changed and became less committal, which raised fears in those in the co-operative and licensed merchant sector, in particular, as well as those pharmacists who provide valuable and necessary access to veterinary medicinal products in many rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The purpose of this regulation is largely to combat antimicrobial resistance and ensure the correct and proper controls and dispensing of veterinary medicinal products more generally. I want to put on the record that we absolutely support the intention of limiting antimicrobial resistance, which is one of the greatest threats to human health internationally. Ireland, of course, must play its part in addressing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The fact is, though, that the European Union recognised that the existing prescribing and dispensing regime on this island was already sufficiently robust in that a derogation was placed into the regulation specifically to allow for the continuation of those existing prescribing regimes in Ireland, both North and South, and Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Prior to the withdrawal agreement, Britain availed of that derogation. I am told that the British Government reached out to its Irish counterparts to facilitate a joint approach towards the derogation and was told that Ireland was not interested in its approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I later learned from officials within the European Commission that they were confused as to why Ireland had not availed of the derogation. This was effectively indicated by responses my colleague, Sinn Féin MEP Chris MacManus, received when he put questions to the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> It has seemed for quite some time that the Department has stood against the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine with regard to this Bill, as well as various approaches and legal opinions that have been suggested and brought forward by stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Now, it seems on the face of it that the Minister and Department have accepted to some degree that the role of responsible persons does need to be protected. This is clearly in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee because responsible persons are well-educated and well-qualified in the field in which they ply their trade. They have obtained level 6 qualifications, which will essentially be deemed worthless if we proceed as was initially intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> We have seen this in the absolute collapse in sales of anti-inflammatory products at some co-operatives after similar regulations impacted those products, with sales dropping by over 80% in some cases. As I understand it, it appears there is an acceptance now of what would be described as common sense and that there has been a conversion, but it is not reflected in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> We are close to resolving this issue in a way everyone can get on board with. Nobody is talking about liberalising the prescription or dispensation of antibiotics. In terms of antiparasitics and vaccines, a mechanism is required whereby the client patient practice relationship can be amended regarding farmed ruminants and equine in cases only where those animals are covered by herd health plans operated by licensed merchants, co-operatives or pharmacies.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> I have been advised that the preferred route is to achieve this through a change to the Veterinary Council of Ireland’s code of ethical prescribing and if that can be achieved, then job done. If it does not appear to be feasible, however, then it is still my view that it is up to us collectively as legislators to resolve this situation in primary law.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Given that there has been a weak approach to this regulation to date, I do not believe it is either fair or practical for us to leave this solely in the hands of the Minister and his officials simply to pass this legislation with a promise or a hint that responsible persons will be taken care of down the line. We have seen where that has gotten us in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> My request and appeal to the Minister is that he clearly engages with the Veterinary Council of Ireland to secure the necessary amendments at that level in advance of Committee Stage. Otherwise, I believe we will need to bring forward amendments to the legislation at Committee Stage so that nobody is left beyond any doubt that the matter has been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> I have a continued concern with regard to pharmacists, whose code of conduct prohibits them from having a beneficial relationship with what is prescribed. It would be appreciated if the Minister could speak to this and inform us of how he plans to approach that matter ahead of Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> With regard to this aspect of the Bill, there have been concerns among the farming community, in particular, that this legislation could damage competition, reduce farmers' ability to shop around for veterinary medicinal products and drive up costs. We now have this national veterinary prescription system, NVPS, proposal. It does appear, however, that the system itself appears to have been beset with delays. Internal Department communications I received under a freedom of information request saw officials express concern as to whether the NVPS will actually deliver significant access to generic products.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> With this in mind, it would be useful ahead of Committee Stage if the Department could provide the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine with a briefing paper as to how the engagements with the Health Products Regulatory Authority on this matter are being dealt with, as well as the scope of the generics list that will be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> In terms of the national fertiliser database, of course, this can play an important role in monitoring fertiliser use across the State and assist to deliver improved water quality and reduce greenhouse gases and ammonia emissions, which is something on which we collectively agree and which are aspirations we share.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> There is one obvious problem with the so-called national fertiliser database in that it is not actually national. In the absence of an all-Ireland approach, there are clear concerns as to how measures will be effective, particularly in Border communities, with which the Minister will be well aware in his own constituency, where it is very possible that a farmer's nearest merchant is actually just across the road but happens to be in a different county and different jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Sinn Féin wants to work with the Minister on Committee Stage to ensure that stakeholder concerns regarding the level of data gathered and that the overhead this might place on farmers has been fully addressed, alongside the concerns raised with regard to that limitation in terms of the scope of cross-Border trade. It is not true to say that the situation will be the same for farmers operating on a cross-Border basis who are purchasing fertiliser in County Tyrone if they live in County Monaghan or even <i>vice versa</i>. The fact is that they will have to register as both fertiliser end users and fertiliser economic operators simply for doing the same thing as somebody in a different part of the country, namely, going to the local merchant to purchase fertiliser. That creates concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">With regard to the NVPS and the national fertiliser database, concerns have been expressed by farmers as to how their data may be used for purposes outside of what we understand the primary purposes of the legislation to be. I am sure the Minister will welcome farmers being security conscious in the context of their data. With a view to addressing these concerns, has a data protection impact assessment has been carried out? If not, will the Minister ensure that it is carried out for the NVPS and the national fertiliser database? I hope he is sincere in saying that he is willing to engage with stakeholders and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine as we move to Committee Stage. The stated intentions of the Bill are laudable but we cannot allow a situation where it puts additional financial pressures on farmers or puts local key business in rural communities out of existence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinBrowne" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_425">I thank the Minister for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> A derogation that would have allowed for responsible persons to continue to dispense some veterinary medicinal products, VMPs, without a veterinary prescription was not availed of by the Government. As the Minister knows full well, it led to a lengthy debate on the future of the role of the responsible persons under the new regulation, and the impact this could have on licensed merchants, co-ops and rural economies in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine heard that if this sector of the rural economy was, effectively, to be disempowered, animal welfare could also suffer through a lack of responsible persons and the services they provide through co-ops and licensed merchants.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Another aspect of the same issue concerns the knowledge value of responsible persons and the depth of knowledge they have about the local area, and of health trends on certain farms or within certain flocks and herds. If the role of such people was made redundant, an important skill set would be lost to farms. An important source of information would be gone and rural Ireland would have another challenge to overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> The Minister will be aware the committee was told how when similar regulations were introduced relating to anti-inflammatory products, a subsequent 90% decrease of sales of these products was witnessed in co-ops. This is a not a trend we want replicated. All of this has led to numerous discussions about the value of responsible persons, co-ops and licensed merchants, each of whom has an in-depth knowledge of the local area. This knowledge cannot be easily replicated and covers qualifications that should not be rendered useless. While there are indications that the evidence given to the committee, and discussed elsewhere, has impressed upon the Minister that the role and contribution of these experts should be maintained, the Bill we are discussing still does not expressly say how this will be delivered or what role will be there for the responsible persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Nobody is arguing against the need to tackle antimicrobial or antiparasitic resistance. Rural Ireland and the quality of the food we consume in the State are dependent on the protection of these medicines. We need to take an approach that works for rural Ireland’s economy, that works for animal health, and that works to ensure the viability of the medication we are discussing. When it comes to herd health plans, we cannot be allowed to dismiss the role played by licensed merchants, co-ops, pharmacies and so on. It is good that the Minister has acknowledged this but a plan needs to be outlined, which I will get to shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> The other matter of concern within the agriculture community is in the area of competition and the ability of farmers to shop around after getting the veterinary prescription as demanded under the planned system. Some farmers are likely to feel obliged to purchase these medicines from the vet, given that under the legislation, they must get their prescription from vets. This is where the NVPS came into the picture. It still does not take away from the fact that some farmers would feel unable to look their vet in the eye if they were to get the prescription from them but were then to shop for the product elsewhere. It is human nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> We now understand that the Minister would like to address the concerns I have referred to through a measure outside the legislative arena. This would involve the VCI and the development of a new annexe to accompany its code of practice. In essence, it would enable vets to prescribe without a client-patient-practice relationship presence for farmed ruminant animals, including equines, that are under herd health plans operated by local merchants, co-ops and pharmacies. Of course, this would not involve antibiotics but it would allow professionals within the co-ops and pharmacies who work with individual farmers to prescribe or dispense antiparasitic and vaccine VMPs. If there is a failure or some inability to get this done, then it could be introduced to the legislation, and Sinn Féin will seek to get this added to the legislation on Committee Stage. Allowing for the management and dispensing of antiparasitic products and vaccines under herd health plans managed by professionals in their area seems like common sense. It would benefit farmers and rural communities, and would be of benefit when it comes to animal health.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Another concern I have with the Bill, which is related to the issue I have just addressed, is the lack of an all-island approach to the prescribing and dispensing of VMPs. The derogation I mentioned earlier was not adopted by the Government, but was adopted by Westminster and, therefore, two different regimes will emerge on the same island. The risk to animal health is real in such a circumstance, with knowledge gaps in what has and has not been administered to animals. This would have a knock-on effect to our food standards. This is another reason to work on refining the Bill, as I have suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> I will turn to the national fertiliser database. Similar to the importance of ensuring the viability of antiparasitic products, vaccines and antibiotics, monitoring the use of fertiliser is a key factor in meeting our environmental goals. However, the lack of an all-island approach again throws the purpose of the database into question. For example, in some areas a supplier from across the Border may be the nearest for a farmer in the Republic. Concerns were also expressed at the use of data and the volume gathered.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I look forward to having a discussion on all of these matters when the Bill is examined further on Committee Stage. Equally, I hope the Minister will work with the committee on finding the best way forward for rural communities, farm families and the animals that are under their care.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanKelly" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_436">I am glad the Bill has come before the Dáil following the need to bring it forward and given the need to transpose the EU directive. There has been some controversy in the lead-up to this and I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Events over the past year or so have really driven home the importance of a thriving and sustainable indigenous agrifood sector. With that in mind, this is an important and laudable Bill. It will have significant effects on the modernisation of our agriculture sector, on meeting our climate ambitions, and crucially, on our farmers and how they will operate. While it is a laudable, necessary and well intentioned Bill with some good measures, there are some issues of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> I welcome the introduction of measures to enhance our ability to capture information on fertiliser and its use within the State, as well as the introduction of the national fertiliser database. We often hear about the need for a just transition. I believe this is something all of us in the House strongly campaign for and support; certainly the Labour Party does. There is an argument to be made that in no other industry or profession is the concept of a just transition more important than among our farmers and agricultural workers. We know the significance of our agriculture sector in helping us to mitigate the impact of climate change and helping us to achieve our climate goals. Relative to many other industries, farmers are being asked a lot in transforming the way in which they work, and often with fewer resources at their disposal. That they are supported and incentivised to do so is vital. If the national fertiliser database can help us to keep track of and reward them for their efforts through the eco scheme, it will certainly be a good thing. It will, however, take some time to bed in.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> I reiterate some of the concerns we heard from stakeholders regarding the administrative burden that will be placed on fertiliser users. We cannot expect everybody to be technologically literate on what will happen in this area in a relatively short time. The database must be designed in such a way to be easily accessible and user-friendly. We do not want a situation of non-compliance due to a complicated administrative process, or people relying on others to carry out data entry or processing for them. This would cause a range of other issues. The process needs to be simple and not overly burdensome. We want to encourage our farmers to avail of the eco scheme and take the necessary actions for the betterment of our agriculture sector. Those who might not be quite so computer literate on how to do this must be supported and the process for doing this must be made as easy as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> Some direct material risks contained in the Bill have not been fully dealt with. The principal risk, which happens in quite a number of areas, is that the measures proposed are not from an all-island perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">For all its worth, the national fertiliser database and its inherent purpose are undermined by the fact that there are no mechanisms in the Bill to prevent someone crossing the Border into the North and purchasing fertiliser for use in Ireland that could then go unrecorded. I believe that the vast majority of farmers will comply with what is set out in this Bill, but it would be naive not to assume that a small number would avail of loopholes or simply cross the Border to ensure they will have access to fertiliser.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The same applies to the purchase of veterinary medicines. The absence of an all-island approach to the sale and purchase of veterinary medicines is likely to lead to the emergence of a sort of black market, where people can cross the Border and buy a greater range of range of medicines at a lower cost as a result of the measures we are happily introducing, due to the fact that the same does not apply in the other jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> Cost is at the heart of some of the issues in the Bill. Again, we recognise that this is a laudable and well-intentioned Bill. There is no doubt antimicrobial resistance is a serious issue that we must tackle. However, there is no escaping the fact that limiting the ability to prescribe medicines solely to veterinarians will reduce competition and the choice of medicines available and, ultimately, no matter what we say, lead to higher costs for farmers. What will happen in that case is that again, unfortunately, people will cross the Border. It is irresponsible that there is no mechanism to prevent this from happening. The implications of having medicines from a different regulatory regime used on the livestock that produces our food on which we thrive and export is obvious. It poses a serious threat to our food quality standards. Furthermore, by not allowing designated persons in co-op branches and licensed merchants to prescribe medicines, the Bill not only negatively impacts farmers, but the co-ops and merchants themselves. If a veterinarian writes a prescription, he or she will have the first opportunity to dispense the medicine and, therefore, not only will this Bill increase the cost of medicines for farmers, but it will directly impact the business of local co-ops and licensed merchants.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> We have heard from groups such as the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and other relevant stakeholders about problems in this Bill. We have also heard their solutions. It is disappointing that some element of these solutions was not introduced in the Bill. While the rationale behind this Bill is laudable, it is obvious that we must have sight of how fertiliser is being used in this country to help us manage and reach our climate ambitions. We must also combat antimicrobial resistance to ensure the sustainability of our agrifood sector. Unfortunately, however, as I have outlined, in some parts of this Bill we are creating issues that will not be resolved. That is something we must tease out on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">I acknowledge the work of the Minister and his staff in the Department in progressing this Bill. It has come in for detailed discussion at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which I am privileged to chair.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue that must be addressed. I have full confidence in the Minister that when we eventually pass the legislation in this House, it will achieve its objectives. Human health is paramount and we must do whatever we can to improve it. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem, not just for animal health but for human health. This is one of the main purposes behind this Bill. It is one of the main reasons that I fully support the Minister in his endeavours to get this legislation through the Dáil. The Bill will be on Committee Stage shortly when we will work on it and make sure that it is fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> The point Deputy Kelly made about cross-Border trade will be an issue. It will also be an issue with fertiliser. I am strongly of the view that a 32-county approach is far better for all aspects of food production, no more so than in the sale of veterinary medicines and fertiliser. I hope it is something that we can progress. We are where we are, and we must make sure that we are doing the job correctly here. Farmers will buy into this legislation as they see it is the right route to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> The Minister is fully committed to making sure that co-ops, private merchants, feed mills and pharmacies have the ability to sell these products going forward. A vet will prescribe. I know the Minister is working hard to ensure that a protocol will be in place to allow the availability of products in these outlets. That is essential to ensure competition and that there is no monopoly in existence. The NVPS will be adopted under the legislation. That must be done. I, for one, would not argue that a vet must prescribe all these products, but we can still do that and allow a variety of outlets.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> I suggest to the Minister that a farmer-operated app is essential to go along with this legislation so that a farmer will be able to use the app to contact a veterinarian, whether one operating at a distance or his own vet, someone with knowledge of his herd, and get back a prescription and then he would have a variety of outlets to go to purchase whatever product he wants.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> We have heard discussion in recent weeks about vaccines and where they will fit in with this legislation. It is essential that the availability of vaccines is not restricted under it and that they are more widely used than heretofore, given that prevention is better than cure. We talked about the purpose of the Bill being to reduce antimicrobial resistance. The next generation is farming with me. The reality is that in the past we always dosed according to the calendar. We dosed at turnout, and a month or six weeks after putting cattle into the shed, but the next generation takes swabs from faeces or uses milk samples to determine the level of disease present and what level of dosing is necessary. One practical example of that is fluke. Regimentally, we always dosed for fluke a month or six weeks after housing. My son operates on the basis of the various tests, whether post mortems of cattle that have gone to the factory, or from the milk bulk sample test. If he can see there is no fluke present in the herd, there is no need to dose. That is a good management tool in not building up resistance in the herd, but it is also a cost-saving measure for the farmer. Knowledge is king in how we deal with this issue going forward. The more knowledge at the disposal of farmers and veterinarians in prescribing for the herd, the greater our ability to reduce the usage of these products and to achieve the goals we have set out. The Minister fully understands the complexity of the industry, and ensuring that these products are available under the supervision of a veterinary prescription. I look forward to Committee Stage when we can ensure the legislation is fit for purpose as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> The national fertiliser database is essential for us to maintain our derogation, which is hugely important to intensive beef farmers and the dairy industry. The Minister is working hard to ensure this country maintains its derogation. We must put the database in place. We have introduced banding from 1 January, which is a requirement for us to hold on to our derogation. We are unique in our ability to grow grass in this country. That is the way we can produce sustainable food. It would be a sorry day if our stocking rate was restricted as it would undermine the sustainability of our food production.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The Minister was exceptionally keen to introduce this database from 1 January but we are now into the middle of February. He is impatient to introduce it as quickly as possible. It is essential for him to win our argument on maintaining our derogation. It is to be hoped that following today's debate the Bill can go to Committee Stage as quickly as possible. I assure him we will get it through that Stage as quickly as is feasible. These two separate legislative Parts are linked in the Bill and it is important to get them on the Statute Book. As I said, human health is the topmost concern. Our green image and ability to produce green food can only be enhanced by this legislation. The fertiliser database is an essential part of our fight against climate change and maintaining our derogation status. </p>

          <from>Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important Bill. I thank all the County Mayo farmers, suppliers and those concerned with agriculture who contacted me with their valuable input into the Bill. It is long overdue legislation that has been a source of great anxiety due to the serious risks it could pose to the sector if we do not get it right. It should have been transposed by January 2022 but the delay has largely been of the Government's own making as it looked at the end of the system of allowing people designated as responsible persons, RPs, to dispense.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I am relieved the indications are that the Minister has finally accepted the opinion of all stakeholders outside the Department that the current regime operated by RPs should be maintained. I say "indications" because the fact of the matter is this legislation does not make that clear at this point. The Bill does not deliver a clear role for RPs. As my colleagues stated, the Minister has two options. Either he ensures that the VCI amends its code of practice prior to the passing of this Bill or he must accept amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to provide RPs with a clear role within the legislation. If this is not done correctly, the Bill could have significant impacts on access to VMPs and animal health and welfare, especially in areas on the periphery with more limited access to veterinary services.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> As the Minister will be aware, there is a chronic shortage of vets, especially those working with large animals in the agriculture sector in rural areas. We have allowed a situation to emerge whereby we are only training between a third and a quarter of vets that are needed. While they are being delivered in higher education, it is the Department of Agriculture that has lead responsibility in this area. It is beyond understanding that successive Ministers for agriculture would allow this situation to emerge. An evaluation of farmed animal veterinary service in Ireland in 2020 identified counties Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo, the county in which I live, as having the highest number of herds more than 20 km from their nearest private veterinary practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> The issue before us in the legislation relates to RPs. If their role in the sector is not protected, that would constitute a real threat to thousands of valuable jobs throughout rural Ireland, which simply cannot afford to lose them. The British Government availed of the derogation on the dilution of the role of RPs prior to Brexit. We cannot have a situation where we have two separate regimes for the prescribing and dispensation of VMPs on the island. Some 50% of milk and meat from the North is processed in the South and rightly labelled as Irish but that also means we need to ensure compliance with the same standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> All of that said, it is imperative that measures are employed to tackle antimicrobial and antiparasitic resistance. This is vital for humans as well as animal health. However, these measures need to be done in a way that makes sense to the sector, rural economies and to the island as a whole.</p>

        <speech by="#HollyCairns" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_460">The legislation is necessary to update our laws on veterinary practices and to meet our obligations under several EU directives, including the nitrates directive. It provides for the introduction of regulations and monitoring mechanisms regarding veterinary prescriptions and their dispensing in the importation, sale and use of fertiliser, as well as the creation of a national fertiliser database. It is a long time coming. I recall being in a knowledge transfer group, long before I went into politics, where vets explained the overuse of antibiotics and routine dosing.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Stakeholders recognise the need for regulation in these areas but there are also concerns that the Bill has too many ambiguities and will result in even more bureaucracy for ordinary farmers. Although this legislation is technical in nature, it still touches on many aspects of farming and rural life. It is about our use of fertiliser, our vulnerability to international markets and the glaring need to accelerate the use of viable and sustainable alternatives. This legislation is also about veterinary practice in Ireland, the challenges faced by vets and how we respond to antimicrobial resistance. The agrifood sector is a significant part of the economy and livestock farming is the largest component at approximately 85%. The Bill will, therefore, have a significant impact on the sector and the everyday practices of farmers. There is scope to improve it and make it more effective. It needs to be targeted at supporting family farms and ensuring its obligations can be met easily by people who are already overstretched. I encourage the Minister to listen to the points being raised and continue his engagement with stakeholders to strengthen his approach. The pre-legislative scrutiny process clearly established that farmer representative bodies are more than willing to work with him and have suggested practical solutions to some of the issues identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The VMP aspects of the Bill highlight the many challenges faced by farmers and vets in their attempts to ensure the health of livestock and to act responsibly in the administration of animal-based medication. European VMP regulations are aimed at enhancing safety and availability of VMPs and strengthening the EU response to fight antimicrobial resistance. An effective and co-ordinated approach to combating antimicrobial resistance is incredibly important. It is a major threat to human and animal health. Unfortunately, it is a leading cause of death globally and particularly impacts people in less advantaged countries. The inappropriate use and overuse of antibiotics greatly increases the risk of disease spread, severe illness and mortality. This resistance can also be transferred between diseases causing microorganisms that infect humans and animals and can live on in the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The Minister will also be aware of potential problems raised by the Irish Pharmacy Union, which argues that the Bill may reduce compliance around antimicrobial resistance. Recommendation No. 6 of the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine proposed the separation of prescribing and dispensing of veterinary medicines. It pointed out that this approach was adopted by Scandinavian countries and has achieved significantly lower levels of resistance to medicines. In response, however, the Department said it cannot pursue this approach as it would be seen as providing state aid to one sector as a separation of prescribing and dispensing is found in other EU countries. This rationale could be disputed. The committee called for this proposal to be examined extensively. Will the Minister confirm whether a fresh extensive examination occurred in response to that call? If so, what form did it take? Can he make the results available?</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The VMP regulations need more work. They are part of our response to a significant issue. It is up to the Minister to use the scope available to implement the regulations in a manner that helps farmers and vets. There is a ban on the use of antimicrobials as a prophylactic or preventative measure as regards restrictions on metaphylactic use, which is the administration of a medical product to a whole group of animals when only some of that group have been diagnosed with a clinical disease. This latter practice is common in dairy settings for mastitis control. The restriction on metaphylactic use of antimicrobials makes farm hygiene approaches to managing infection rates even more significant. We all know there are farms that are not meeting these standards and a resultant overreliance on antimicrobials.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> With these new regulations, the Minister has a responsibility and an opportunity to help as many farms as possible become compliant with best practice in this area. A related area highlighted during pre-legislative scrutiny was the national capacity to monitor these issues. Macra na Feirme pointed out the need for proper funding of forage laboratory analysis. There will be increased demand for a range of tests and the State will need to be ready for this. New regulations that put more pressures on family farms must be counterbalanced by the Department having appropriate facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> These regulations also cover the supply of antiparasitic VMPs, in particular, with products changing from merchant products to prescription-only medicines. The agriculture committee's report, reflecting the inputs of stakeholders, expressed considerable concern regarding these changes. These range from reduced choice and increased cost to farmers to the impacts of restricting or ceasing the role of the responsible person in the supply of medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The Minister will be aware that this was a substantial item of discussion of the committee and that the farming organisations have genuine and practical points which need to be addressed. I hope the Minister will consider those points on the later Stages of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The benefit of this legislation is that it has allowed for a discussion of the role vets have in our agrifood system and the pressures they face. In its submission to the committee, Veterinary Ireland, the representative body for nearly 1,000 private veterinary practitioners, points out the significant burdens vets face in providing 24-hour care for animals. This includes the cost of operating this model, the disruption to work-life balance and the challenges in recruiting and retaining veterinary staff. The Minister needs to be conscious of these matters, not only in the context of this Bill but also in ensuring we have sufficient vets in all areas across the country to support family farming. I think everybody who is involved in farming really appreciates that we have an incredible veterinary service. In that way it needs to be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The regulation on fertiliser is another crucial development but it needs to be designed and implemented with farmers and agricultural organisations to ensure its effectiveness. In the pre-legislative scrutiny process, we heard worries expressed about additional bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The national fertiliser database is intended to be a tool to help the nitrates action programme. We know that agriculture is the single biggest source of water pollution in Ireland and we all want to address that. The proposed database is intended to provide a better understanding of current fertiliser use. It would also facilitate the national agriculture inspection programme on chemical fertiliser control. Crucially, measures to improve best practice and to begin to turn the tide on our shocking levels of water pollution and soil degradation are necessary, but we need to do this in a way that encourages compliance. Numerous practical issues and uncertainties were raised by stakeholders in pre-legislative scrutiny, and it is important to acknowledge that the Minister has made changes to the Bill to reflect some of them, but there are some outstanding matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> One of the primary concerns was that the database could increase the administrative burden on fertiliser users. The committee called for an accessible and user-friendly design. The Department has clarified that the system will use the existing portal, <i>agfood.ie</i>, and that farmers can use their herd numbers. The committee recommended that there be continuous engagement with the Department as the database is rolled out. That is the very least we can expect to help make the process as easy and efficient as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Another matter was the situation whereby sports clubs may use fertiliser on their grounds. The Department has clarified that those clubs will be required to register as professional fertiliser users. This question that arises is whether they know that. Many farmers will be aware of these impending changes, but sports clubs may not. What steps is the Minister taking to inform and educate all relevant farmers, sports clubs and other fertiliser users? There is an obligation on the Government to be proactive in helping all stakeholders to understand the changes and to support them in adhering to the new regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> The regulation of fertilisers is an opportunity for us to think about our reliance on industrial imported chemical fertilisers. This time last year, farmers were facing inconsistent price increases, with international restrictions on nitrates, and that was before the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There is an urgent need to end our dependence on chemical fertiliser. It represents the type of intensive farming that is forcing farmers to do more and more for less and less. Sustainable agriculture needs to mean practices that can be maintained using natural approaches that use the strengths of our soil and climate rather than working against them and leaving farmers reliant on these imported elements, the price of which we cannot control. If we do not truly try to address this now, which I do not believe we are doing, we are blatantly leaving it to the next generation to do it. I mean not just the next generation of politicians but the next generation of farmers too. The longer we leave it, the harder it will get. I do not think we have grasped how important this issue is, and the relative emptiness of the Chamber compared with when other issues are discussed is evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> We do not have to look very far for more evidence. There is the absence of a nutrient management plan, which Macra na Feirme has been calling for, and there is the very existence of the derogation for nitrates and the continuous glossing over, the ignoring, of that in this Chamber because nobody wants to really address it. It is worth noting that a lot more needs to be done on this, and the Government is not working towards that. As I said, the longer this is left, the harder it will be for farmers. This is not doing them any favours.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> While the introduction of new regulations necessarily involves disruption and a new way of doing things, I can only hope the Government will work with all the stakeholders to make this a smooth process. These regulations are in response to real issues with antimicrobial resistance and water pollution. It is fair to say that we are all invested in addressing these matters; the challenge is how we do it. Some outstanding shortcomings can be resolved. If the Bill moves through the next Stages, I encourage the Minister to return to the committee's report and engage further with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">The benefit of this Bill is that we will be able to bring in legislation in areas left to national discretion in a manner that is most appropriate to Irish agriculture, with a view to protecting animal health and ensuring that the market for veterinary medicinal products and medicated feeds is an effective, equitable and functioning one. The introduction of the proposed prescribing database will allow for the direct uploading of all generated veterinary prescriptions to a centralised cloud in order that, once they are generated, the animal keeper will be sent a copy of the prescription or token via email or SMS. This is similar in some respects to a human prescription being emailed to a pharmacy, a practice we are all used to. The veterinary prescription can then be dispensed by either the prescribing vet or another dispensing party, such as a licensed merchant or operator, pharmacist or medicated feed mill, on presentation of the electronic prescription, token, bar code, PIN, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> The legislation will also allow the Minister to capture the processed fertiliser data. Collecting such information will improve traceability in respect of fertiliser use. It will facilitate and improve compliance. It will also allow Ireland to meet our commitment to the European Commission arising out of the recent review of the nitrates action programme and the extension of Ireland's nitrates derogation.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> The making of regulations under the Bill will provide the animal keeper or farmer and the community with a much greater choice as to where they may obtain their veterinary medicine and will potentially reduce the administrative burden as a key objective of the EU regulation for those prescribing, dispensing and purchasing veterinary medicinal products, VMPs, as well as positively impacting animal and human health.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The introduction of a national database and a system to record prescriptions of VMPs can potentially simplify record keeping. It will also provide greater regulatory oversight of those involved in the general prescription, dispensing and use of VMPs. The greater oversight will ultimately protect those meeting their regulatory function. It will also allow Ireland to meet its reporting requirements under the EU regulation. The Bill will facilitate the recording of fertiliser sales data and will not impact the ability to purchase fertiliser. It will also reduce the administrative burden for farmers participating in the proposed national targets. In addition, the proposed database will provide reliable data to farmers, which they can then use to qualify for possible voluntary industry sustainability initiatives that will reward their actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> The Bill is more than welcome. We need to move on it as quick as we can.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patricia Ryan<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_481">This Bill will repeal the Animal Remedies Act 1993 to modernise the legislation that governs veterinary medicine. It will also amend the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act. It is long overdue and yet another example of Government failure to transpose regulations on time. Ireland has been in breach of its legal obligations for over a year, with the Government dragging its feet. The EU regulation is intended to combat antimicrobial resistance and will require a veterinary prescription for all antibiotics and antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products as well as vaccines. In developing this regulation, the EU recognised that the existing regime for dispensing veterinary medicinal products differed between Ireland and Britain and much of mainland Europe. A derogation was introduced which allowed for responsible persons to continue in their existing role, as is common practice here.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">While the British Government availed of that derogation, the Irish Government did not. As a result, there are concerns that the qualifications of responsible persons will be rendered meaningless and that there will be a knock-on effect for rural jobs, as well as increased costs for farmers, not to mention the negative impact on animal welfare. In response to these concerns, the Government must establish a national veterinary prescription system which would require all vets to provide an e-prescription that would also facilitate the use of generic medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine heard that similar regulations on anti-inflammatory products led to a 90% reduction in sales in co-operatives. We must protect our rural economy. It is clear that measures are available to address antimicrobial and antiparasitic resistance. This is vital for human and animal health. However, there must be a common-sense approach which allows for the management and dispensing of antiparasitic medicines and vaccines under herd health plans managed by professionals in their area.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> The national fertiliser database can play an important role in monitoring fertiliser use across the State, assisting the delivery of improved water quality and reducing greenhouse gases and ammonia emissions. There are concerns about the lack of an all-Ireland approach on this issue, particularly in Border areas where a farmer's nearest supplier may be across the Border. Our farmers are facing a daunting bill of over €1 billion for fertilisers this year due to the soaring cost of fertilisers and the lack of Government support. The Government must act to ensure our farmers are supported. They have a vital role in food production and climate action and they must get the support they need to ensure family farms remain viable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_485">I have been raising matters related to the issue we are discussing, veterinary medicines, for a number of years. My concern has been that it would damage the rural economy if the proposal not to allow responsible persons to prescribe all medicines were to go ahead. That system has worked well for many years given that the responsible persons were knowledgeable and understood farmers' needs. My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group had hoped the Minister would move faster to provide assurances to licensed merchants and would take on board the recommendations in the report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine issued last year. It was a pleasure to participate in the committee's discussion, at which there was cross-party unity on this issue and on the need to protect and respect our licensed merchants. My colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, has done a lot of work on this matter in the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The joint committee's report strongly recommended that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine ensure the continuation of the existing network, which includes licensed merchants and veterinary pharmacists, as a recognised route of supply of antiparasitic medicines. However, it now seems that the Government has seen fit to prioritise the views of the EU and the advice of the Attorney General, which was also sought on this matter. This is despite clear evidence that a derogation was possible for agri-merchants. I know from my engagement with the Independent Licensed Merchants Association, ILMA, that in excess of 900 licensed merchants operate in this country, of which an estimated 200 are owner operated, exclusively supplying veterinary medicines and allied inputs, or general farm supply stores supplying a range of other farm requirements, including hardware, feedstuff and fertilisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> As I said in August 2021, the Department seemed determined to pursue a new regulatory regime that would erode the capacity of the responsible persons to prescribe and sell antiparasitic veterinary medicines. It is difficult to overstate the level of concern that now exists within the agri-merchant sector following the decision of the Department to pursue the regulatory approach outlined in the Bill. This makes a complete mockery of the extensive investigation of this matter carried out by the joint committee and the excellent and balanced report it subsequently issued. It also makes a mockery of the cross-party unity that existed on the committee on this issue. Are we seriously expected to believe the report, which explicitly called for the continuation of the existing network, which includes licensed merchants and veterinary pharmacists as recognised routes of supply of antiparasitic medicines, was somehow reckless in its recommendations or deficient in its insight? It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Department has simply set aside the solutions on offer in order to pursue and implement a decision that it had already arrived at prior to the beginning of the entire consultation process. When I raised this matter with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, in May 2021, he stated that he did not want to see a cliff-edge scenario where employment was jeopardised and the rural economy threatened but that is precisely the situation we have arrived at. That is unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">The Minister was dealt a devastating blow in the lead-up to Christmas as the much anticipated Bill was suddenly put on hold, causing embarrassment and humiliation. The former Attorney General, Paul Gallagher, single-handedly scuttled the Bill with a legal opinion that confirmed to many that it was dead in the water. In a scathing report, the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> exposed the shoddy and haphazard nature of the legislative and consultative process surrounding this Bill, highlighting the inefficiency and incompetence of both the Minister and his Department. It is inconceivable that the Minister would stand tall and present this Bill as anything but a relic of a bygone era. His credibility has been severely damaged and he is unable to bring forth this Bill with any shred of authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> The stringent regulations on animal medicines imposed by the EU as part of its effort to curb antibiotic use are commendable. There are, however, valid concerns that the stricter controls will result in a near monopoly of veterinary practices in the sale and supply of traditional treatments that have been provided by smaller merchants for years. Despite the Minister's assurance, it is clear the Bill will drive up prices for essential products like doses and drenches, putting enormous pressure on vets who are already in short supply all over the country. The shortage of veterinary services and coverage, a reality faced by farmers in west Donegal in the Minister's constituency, is testament to the dire state of affairs. The Minister's blunder has cast a shadow of doubt over his ability to lead and manage crucial legislative matters. The haphazard approach to the Bill has drawn criticism from various sectors and raises questions about the thoroughness and due diligence exercised by the Minister and his Department. Farmers and the general public deserve better. They deserve to have confidence in their leaders to make informed decisions that impact their lives and livelihoods.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> Furthermore, the new rules on animal medicines have far-reaching consequences that cannot be ignored. The impact on smaller merchants who have been providing traditional treatments for years will be significant. Their survival may be at stake. The increase in prices for essential products like doses and drenches will also have a trickle-down effect on farmers who will be forced to bear the additional costs, leading to decreased profitability and competitiveness. If the Minister pushes ahead with the legislation without revision, farmers will face decreased availability of antiparasitic products and increased costs. The sustainability of the co-operative store network, independent merchants and veterinary pharmacists will be severely impacted. The ICOS has requested an immediate meeting with the Minister to seek an amendment to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> The Minister must take a step back and reassess the Bill, considering the criticisms and concerns raised by various stakeholders. He must engage in meaningful consultation and ensure the legislative process is transparent and thorough. Farmers and members of the public deserve nothing less but it appears that, yet again, the ordinary people on the ground, including hard-working dairy and suckler farmers, will be worst affected by this. The Minister did not stand by them. He should do so now. His constituency is like my constituency of Cork South-West where hardworking farmers are struggling to survive. The price of veterinary products and fertilisers has gone completely out of control. The cost of fuel for farm contractors has also gone out of control over the past 12 months and the Minister stood idly by. He was quite happy that they took it on the chin because he was running with the green agenda, which will wipe out agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Deputy McConalogue is the Minister who is standing over that. He is the Minister who stands for the farmers and the fishermen of this country - the two groups he has been failing to stand by up until now.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">First, what I would have to say in this debate is a simple straightforward fact. Why, if something is not broken, could the Minister not let it alone? What the Minister will do single-handedly in this legislative process was highlighted by the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>. I thank the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> for the scathing article it wrote, which was very informative. It let the farmers and the people of Ireland know exactly what the Minister is doing in this legislation. What the Minister is doing is attacking a system that was working perfectly well whereby if one goes to a mart or any of the agri-stores, one had small-time providers of medicines, of all the doses and of all the different medicinary items that are needed by farmers. They were providing an excellent service. Now the Minister is attacking their way of living and potentially taking away their livelihood. The Minister is also putting it all over on the veterinarians. Any time the Minister attacks the supply, he is potentially increasing the cost of the goods. That will have a negative effect on farmers at a time when every euro is important and on the service that those people were providing, that is, something else called "credit".</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Often a person could be at a mart when he or she might not have the money to pay, but the person dispensing the medicines knew the customer. Those dispensing the medicines knew their farmers were good for it and they would give them a little credit, which would be very important until a cheque would come through, maybe from the mart, for the animals that they were selling on the day. The Minister is interfering with all of that in this and it shows a complete lack of understanding of what the people in the countryside are saying. The farmers are not looking for this. The people providing the veterinarian items are not looking for it. Why, in the name of God, is the Minister doing this?</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> I come now to look at what the Minister is doing with fertiliser. This new initiative will be a major burden to farmers and merchants. While it is being sold as being about helping farmers maintain their nitrates derogation and monitoring department schemes, in reality it is more about monitoring farmers and beating them into submission to achieve stringent climate targets and ultimately reducing stocking rates. That is what this is actually about. Under this Bill, farmers who do not register for the database will be flagged on the system and reminded to do so. All this would mean is that when ordering fertiliser in the future merchants will be legally required to ask for the farmer's herd number, which must be registered in the national fertiliser database, and any discrepancy will be flagged and addressed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through inspections, fines and, potentially, court appearances.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> What we should be debating tonight is the cost of fertiliser, what farmers have to pay for it, what they have to pay for medicines and how difficult it is to be a farmer in the Ireland of today. Instead, the Minister is here tying up more red tape, more legislative quangoism and attacking again, as I say, the merchants.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Has the Minister anything to say? I would like the Minister, when he will be addressing this, to talk about those merchants. I would love the Minister to tell me what has he against them. In our local marts in Kerry, for example, there is a person operating inside in a room and providing a great service to the farmers. That person is extremely knowledgeable about all the doses and everything. What has the Minister got to say to those people whose way of living he is attacking? I would love to hear the Minister answer that. I would love to hear the Minister say that he does not give a damn about them, he will shut them down and they will go home. They see their way of living, making a living for themselves and for their families - they were paying their tax and they were minding their own business - all being taken away from them. Has the Minister got anything to say about that?</p>

          <p eId="para_498">This Bill has been passed by the EU. I have many concerns about this Bill. If one looks at the cost it will impose on farmers, we have always seen here from the medical side of things the way different measures have gone. What the Minister has done will mean that if the farmer wants a medicine, he will have got to go to the vet and the paper trail that will follow this has a cost. The farmer will pay the cost because of the paper trail.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> The Minister then came along and said that one must register, and register online. The Minister might learn from registration on different systems the Government puts up online that it is nothing but confusing. I have seen recently where now they are doing the safe pass online. They have told us that people who have been passing the safe pass course for many years are now failing it because of the online system and yet the Minister will now complicate this system by putting people online. Does the Minister think farmers have nothing else to do but sit at home, go online, press this button and press that button when the next thing is the Internet fails? They have work to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> What farmers trusted in previously were the independent people who came and gave them their medicines. If one looks at the stores that were carrying the medicines, it was not only medicines that they were carrying. They were carrying a full range of products for the farming industry but yet - the Minister himself comes from the farming industry - the Minister has complicated the hell out of it. Now the Minister is taking away another product from a business that was set up in a local area. How many creameries have closed in local areas? I counted 11 local creameries in County Limerick in the past three years. Now one has to drive to Limerick if one wants certain products because the Government closed them down. It depends on what co-operative one is with. People locally, in my area, now have to drive to Limerick. The Government is talking about lowering emissions but yet it puts more time on the farmer as if he had nothing else to do but sit into the car and drive to Limerick, taking half an hour out of his day there and half an hour back. It is as if they had nothing else to do but travel around the country when they already are under pressure trying to do the work that they have to do at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The paperwork that follows this type of legislation is off the wall. All the Minister will do is put the small farmers in this country out of business. By putting the small farmer in this country out of business, the Minister will have killed the local economy and what they were giving back on the circular economy to the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The Minister has also destroy the next generation. The Minister has taken the next generation completely out of it. They look at their mothers and their fathers working the land and say to their friends that it is not worth it and that they will head off to Australia and leave the land. They see the hard work that their parents, uncles, aunts or whoever have put in to try and keep the family farm. By doing this, the Minister is closing down businesses that were supplying locally to the farmers. The Minister is taking another product off of the businesses and all he has done is put another cost, a prescription cost, onto the farmer. Well done on that, Minister.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_503">This Bill will have very serious implications for farmers, and especially small farmers in rural Ireland, predominantly in the west. Things are very bad as it is, and it is hard enough for people to survive and to make ends meet. The other problem is how to entice the young generation to follow in their footsteps. With what is going on now, there is no effort being made to help these farmers. We should be talking about the price of fertiliser, and what it is costing people.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> It is evident that the purpose of this register is not for fun. This is Green policy. The Minister is saying that the Government is not bringing in any programme to make farmers reduce their herds, but it is doing it in another way. It is evident that in any year the Minister will restrict farmers to so much fertiliser. The Minister has not told us yet what that limit will be but this register is not for the fun of it. The Minister will tell them, and that will be the next legislation or the next part of his programme. The Minister will tell them what they will only be allowed to spread. In any year - I am a farmer too - grass growth is different. Some years one would have to put out way less fertiliser and in others one would have to put out way more because it does not work fast, it is slow to work or in the heat it will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">There are so many differences. At the time that farmers want grass to grow, it will not grow without fertiliser and the fertiliser often does not work. Farmers will have to reduce their stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> There is no concern in the Government about food security. In California, we hear it costs $1 for one egg and $12 for a dozen eggs. It will not be long before that happens here because people have to reduce the number of hens they have and need a herd number to have hens. We have all of this carry-on. The Government is leaving the people behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> As well as voting for the Healy-Raes, which we are very proud of, people in rural Ireland have voted for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and they still do, but they are being let down at the behest of the Green Party. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will pay a high price for the positions they secured by getting the Green Party to back them. The Green Party is getting everything it wanted at the expense of the people in rural Ireland. A great man, Terence O'Shea, who supplies veterinary products at Kenmare Mart will be gone with the passing of this Bill. Vets did not look for this; they have plenty to do without having more red tape and responsibility imposed on them. It will cause problems for farmers by making it harder for them to access the doses and drenches they need. They were able to do two things at the one time at the mart but now the Government is going to close down Terence O'Shea's business and other businesses. Instead of talking about the cost of fertiliser or trying to help farmers, the Government is trying to paralyse them further and drive them down into the ground, more so than has been done already.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">Experts who know about farming are, unfortunately, incredibly concerned about antimicrobial resistance. They do not feel it is being taken seriously enough and are concerned about the speed with which this is being implemented. I am hopeful there will be some degree of progress on that issue under the current Minister. The Bill has the potential in the medium term to have a significant impact on the effectiveness of animal medicines in Ireland. This will have knock-on consequences for the food supply chain in this country. Education is the best way out of this. Perhaps there is an argument that it creates an administrative burden for people living on farms. They are aware of all the ongoing administration that has to be done. There are heaps of it and I recognise that, but this is being done for a reason and it is the correct one.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> The attitude taken by some Deputies, including the one we just listened to, comes from a very bad place. I do not understand the opposition to this measure. The reason vets are being asked to intervene in these cases is to ensure there is proper authorisation for the administration of products. Vets could charge €15 or €20 for that service but if doing so safeguards food security for the next two or three decades and prevents even greater negative effects from antimicrobial resistance on food supplies and animal health, it will be worth its weight in gold for farmers across the country. That is the message I received from a retired Department vet I happened to run into recently. The individual in question was very sincere. I wanted to convey that message with the Department officials present.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> On the fertiliser issue, farmers engaged in post-quota expansion in the dairy sector are concerned about the impact this will have from an administrative point of view. I encourage the Department to be careful in what it does. Farmers get that there is a push from some parts of the Government - hopefully not from Fianna Fáil - that fertiliser use must be reduced. Fertiliser has a purpose and is important. Depending on the weather and at certain times of the year, significant amounts of fertiliser are required to encourage grass growth. Some of the advances in the area of introducing fertiliser registers, which will probably eventually lead to farmers being asked to reduce their use of fertiliser, are very unfair in the context of post-quota expansion in Ireland. There are people who spend hundreds of thousands of euro, in some cases up to €1 million, of their own money on the expansion of their herds and facilities. They did so on Government advice and on the basis of Harvest 2020. That is not fair. I remember going to talks in Moorepark with my father around the time the quota was to be abolished. The term used to describe milk in Ireland at that time was "liquid gold". That was the farming terminology used when talking to people. Investment was being prioritised for new slurry capacity, new sheds and acquiring land. Thank God for the high milk prices last year because many younger farmers who had engaged in such expansion were put to the pin of their collar. They now see this debate on herd reductions and fertiliser registers, two issues that are causing alarm.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I disagree with the comments made by Opposition Deputies on AMR because they are not based on fact. I am hearing from experts I trust, who have spent their lives working for the betterment of agriculture in this State, that AMR as an issue in Ireland, and internationally, could have devastating consequences for agriculture, including our meat and dairy industries. It is like the law of diminishing marginal utility. As more medication and antibiotics are used in our dairy herds and other sectors of agriculture, the knock-on consequence will be a decline in the effectiveness of these medicines, and that is profoundly concerning.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I ask that the Department engage with organisations, such as the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and the IFA. I know it has been in talks with those organisations but I ask that it step up that engagement and convey that message. I often recognise that agriculture in our constituencies, Donegal and Cork East, is like chalk and cheese. The Minister has come down to us on several occasions but that is a message that needs to be communicated for the right reasons. It may not be popular to say this, certainly based on what we heard here earlier, but from my experience as someone who farms at weekends, I would like the Minister to drive this on and get it done. This is European legislation. We could have done this sooner but we must do it now.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">I am slightly surprised by the previous speaker's characterisation of this debate as the Opposition speaking waffle and the Government speaking truth. I never subscribed to an <i>Animal Farm</i> characterisation of anything, not even farming and certainly not politics. We have the two legs good, four legs bad view which then changes over and there is a monopoly of wisdom on one side of the House and a monopoly of darkness and ignorance on the other. Governments then change and the monopolies change too. I find that divisive.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> I agree with the Deputy, however, to the extent that antimicrobial resistance poses a real problem not just to agriculture but also to humanity. Antimicrobial resistance is a huge problem. We see the result of it in the over-prescribing of medicines to humans. We also saw how antimicrobial resistance grew in the former Soviet Union as a result of the overuse of medicines, sometimes without prescription. Undoubtedly, the same thing can happen and is happening in agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">It is something that needs to be dealt with and I completely agree with Deputy O'Connor to that extent. Equally, I agree with him and with the Minister that the Minister has now very little choice but to bring in this legislation. I would have thought there were other ways to deal with it. Clearly, we need to register the use of antibiotics. Britain obtained a derogation where the dispensing person did not need to be a veterinarian. Ireland did not avail of a derogation at that time. It would be useful to know why because the same practices as existed in Britain, and Northern Ireland for that matter, existed here. I do not have a problem with the requirement to register the use of medicines, or the sale of medicines and to whom they are being sold etc. We need to differentiate a little bit between antimicrobials and antiparasitics in that regard but they are both, as I understand it, being covered by this legislation. Undoubtedly, we need to make sure, as Deputy Cahill said earlier, that there is not an overuse of antiparasitics although arguably this might pose less of an immediate threat than the overuse of antimicrobials. It is still, at best, a waste of money. I do not think anybody would say it is a good idea to be administrating medicines to any livestock if they do not need it. There was a failure to avail of a derogation when Ireland could have. It is not like we do not have plenty of agricultural staff in Brussels; we have always had an agricultural attaché with plenty of support there. I would like to know why that was not availed of at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> I am conscious of leaving time for my colleagues to come in but the other concerns I have with regard to the legislation is that we now have a position where inevitably we will have this growth of one-stop shops where veterinarians will prescribe and sell medicine. Potentially there is a dangerous vested interest there in over-prescribing and over-sale of medicines. It is something the Minister should look to curb if he is acknowledging we need this legislation. I accept there is no alternative now but to bring in legislation in accordance with EU law requiring that antimicrobials, and indeed all medicines, be based on a prescription issued by a veterinarian. I would like to know why we did not avail of a derogation when we could have but that ship has sailed or that bird as flown; take whichever cliché one wants to use. Now that we are doing that, is there not a danger of creating a vested interest whereby veterinarians will be able to prescribe and sell? Obviously, the more they prescribe, the more they sell and the more they sell, the more money they make. That is a danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> With regard to fertilisers, I do not have a problem with the requirement to register fertilisers. There is undoubtedly a huge problem with our water table. Farmers are being scapegoated slightly and Coillte and the forestry sector play a large part in the deterioration of our water table as well. The danger with regard to both medicines and fertilisers is that the regulations are going to come down across the Border and we will have no control, no records, no anything and that is something I fear has not been factored in sufficiently to this.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelLowry" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Deputy Michael Lowry<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_525">We live in world of regulations. Almost everything we do on a day-to-day basis is regulated in some way or another. Compared to decades ago in Ireland, the farming industry has seen regulations imposed on almost every aspect of its business. Farmers across Tipperary tell me that the most stressful element of farming is coping with the excessive quantities of red tape and bureaucracy. The vast majority of regulations have been willingly accepted and introduced. The ultimate benefits have been recognised and while costs are always a major concern, compliance with new rules has been largely achieved. This is because the vast majority of farmers see the wisdom in doing so. They see the wisdom and they see the potential benefits. When something makes sense, farmers are the first to acknowledge that fact. One of the key factors to be borne in mind in relation to this Bill is that its purpose is to introduce legislation that will allow for the EU regulations on the issue of veterinary medicines be decided by a national law. This means, or should mean, that we have a say in how these laws are implemented. It should also mean we take on board our own domestic situation, examine how effectively and successfully it is working and scrutinise how new regulations will impact on all partners to the industry. From a farming perspective, this approach is not reflected in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Inevitably, laws passed at European Union level will not always be acceptable on a one-size-fits-all basis for each member state. Each country has, up to now, been operating variations in the ways in which it handles matters as determined by its own practices and circumstances. This has long been the case in Ireland. Unless serious problems have been identified with the existing system, the question is why they are being asked to change. When it comes to the use of antiparasitic medicines in farm animals, generations of Irish farmers, including those in Tipperary, have obtained such medications from their local co-op or farm store. This has meant that if a farmer felt an animals required certain medicines such as antiparasitics or antibiotics, it was a matter of purchasing them from the qualified person with responsibility for such sales at the co-op. We all accept that farmers know their animals. They care for them on a daily basis and know exactly what is best for them. This has always been the case and few, if any, problems have arisen. Co-ops know the farmers personally. They take a responsible approach to the dispensing of medications. The system works on knowledge and trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> However, this Bill means that this long-established practice is no longer considered acceptable. This Bill suggests that farmers are incapable of caring for their animals. It implies that the years of successful experience which farmers have in this area cannot be trusted. Equally it suggest that the co-ops have not been upholding their area of responsibility. Neither of these implications are sustained by facts. Farmers are fully cognisant of the fact that animal products are destined for the human food chain. The production of animals is their livelihood. They do what is correct to keep their animals healthy. In fact, Irish farmers pride themselves on producing healthy and wholesome food.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> As a result of this Bill, farmers will now be required to obtain a prescription from a veterinarian in order to obtain routine medicines for their animals. According to the Bill, veterinarians will keep an electronic record of the medicines prescribed to regulate the amounts given and to ensure approved products and standards are adhered to and that the dosage and dosing frequency is appropriate to each animal. Farmers are fully aware, from an animal welfare perspective and from an end user viewpoint, that administering too much or too little of any form of antimicrobial medicine can have detrimental consequences. Their livelihood depends on ensuring their animals are healthy and well. As Ireland exports 85% of its total meat production to 75 countries across the globe, the guaranteed quality of our products is of paramount importance, not just to the overall economy, but to the survival of our already heavily regulated farming industry. Our overall standards are recognised as being very high. Farmers will not risk anything that would jeopardise this major advantage in the marketplace. To imply otherwise is to undermine farmers who work conscientiously to ensure our farm to fork reputation has remained unblemished.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The introduction of these new regulations on veterinary-only prescribing also throws up another serious issue. Has the Minister and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, factored in the ongoing serious shortage of vets? This lack of vets already poses huge problems for our agrifood sector. The sector is facing a crisis with just one-in-four new registered vets being educated in Ireland. How can farmers be expected to adhere to new regulations if the only people permitted to implement them are not available to prescribe? We are talking about rural Ireland. Vets are not queueing up to live and work in urban areas, much less in rural locations. Will farmers be required to go on a waiting list in order to give routine worm treatments?</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> The impact of these measures on co-ops across Tipperary and the entire country has been seriously underrated or consciously overlooked. This Bill will have an enormous impact on these businesses which have been the mainstay in farming communities. It will give rise to a loss of a lucrative income for the co-ops and will also threaten jobs and the livelihood of employees. Farmers are loyal to the co-op services they use and have built up long-standing business relationships and friendships with the staff. Apart from their own situation, the farming community is genuinely concerned about the effect the fallout of this Bill will have on co-ops. Co-ops and farming go hand in hand in rural Ireland. They depend on each other. They work together for the common good. The success of one is dependent on the success of the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> The issues around fertilisers are less contentious but are nonetheless concerning to farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The war in Ukraine has resulted in a reduction in the availability of fertiliser, as many fertiliser production plants were located there. As would be expected, the fallout from this reduced availability has led to a substantial rise in the cost of fertiliser. It is not known how long this situation will last. There are fears that these increased costs will result in widespread restricted fertiliser use and reduced availability of products throughout the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Under the new regulations, there will now be a requirement for farmers' purchase of fertilisers to be recorded on a database. This new database will be designed to track accurately individual farmers' purchase of fertilisers, including all nitrogen, phosphorus and potash sales. With the increased cost of fertilisers, farmers anticipate they will use less fertiliser during 2023. Not only will higher costs be a factor, but a lack of availability and difficulty in obtaining fertiliser will be a problem for all Irish farmers. The fear among farmers is that the reduced level of fertiliser, when officially recorded on a database, will impact on future policy decisions as this is the database that will facilitate Ireland's eco scheme under Ireland's common agricultural strategy. This is of serious concern for farmers as their future livelihoods are dependent on crucial decisions taken remotely on their behalf. This will be unfair and unjust and they need to have a cast-iron guarantee that circumstances outside of their control will not be used as a stick to beat them with in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">I want to say a few things about the Bill. I was at a protest in Roscommon mart yesterday about the viability of the sheep industry. From speaking to farmers, I am aware that there is a palpable fear that the new legislation will add to the cost of running a farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> It has been pointed out that existing practice has proven to be good. There is an element of trust between farmers to make sure that livestock get the proper amount of medicine, that is, not too much and not too little. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise anywhere. While the EU has introduced legislation at European level, it is important we examine how we deal with it in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> Farm and mart stores are concerned they will lose vital business which keeps them afloat because marts on their own are a very precarious business. Marts have become involved in the business of farm supplies and medicines, administered by people working in them who are qualified to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> The idea that all medicines will have to be prescribed is one thing, but the fact that vets will set up shops in which to sell medicines is a source of concern. For example, there will be no rural presence for these medicines. People will have to drive to the nearest town or wherever their vet is. When we give over the right to prescribe, administer and sell particular products, we will find there will be an increase in costs. We will also find that the business of marts and mart and farm supply stores will be decimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> While there is a need to introduce legislation, it is time to look at this issue in light of the good practice in this country. There is nothing wrong that needs to be put right, bar an EU regulation that needs to be imposed. In doing that, we should tailor the Bill to suit Irish farmers and the way they do their business. We should also make sure they are not going to incur increased costs. We should not realise in five years' time that we are tied up in more bureaucracy and online systems that farmers find it hard to cope with.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> At the protest at the mart in Roscommon yesterday one of the things I found striking was the age profile of farmers. There are not too many young farmers. The technology required to record fertilisers and keep account of everything is increasing the digital burden on farmers who do not have the training to do this work. There are farmers who are of an age whereby they are not computer literate and will never be, despite all of the good intentions of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Online systems are great in theory. They come from a belief that that is where we are going. However, while we are transitioning to a more digital age we need to make sure that farmers are not caught up in systems they cannot deal with. One good example of this is ANC applications, where farmers have been disqualified from getting any money on the basis they did not click one button. Farmers are fearful that the online system is unforgiving and if they do something wrong there is no recourse to put it right. They are then excluded or penalised. That is what is most concerning for farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Those with small family farms are concerned that they are now in a situation whereby costs are increasing and things are constantly changing. An EPA report released last weekend more or less ruled us out of producing food, apart from a very small amount, and instead advocated flooding our lands and reducing our stocks. It was not helpful that such an unsolicited report would be released and create more fear for farmers, in particular young farmers. I hope the Minister will clearly dismiss the report and put it in the bin because it is not what farmers have signed up to. </p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Farmers are the custodians of the land and environment. They want to get involved and do things right, but when such reports are released they become fearful. The fact something new is coming in the Bill has created another fear for farmers. It is important that whatever happens here is done in the interests of farmers, the quality of our food products and the viability of our farms.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">The Veterinary Medicinal Products, Medicated Feed and Fertilisers Regulation Bill 2023 is meant to address two distinct areas of agricultural importance, namely veterinary medicines and fertilisers. While some of this is certainly necessary, there is total over-regulation across agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> As the last speaker said, a large portion of farmers thankfully live to a ripe old age and are still farming into their 80s and 90s. Many are not computer savvy, but they are very proud, bright and well educated and provide wonderful husbandry of the land, flora, fauna, hedgerows and drainage. They understand and love nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Many rural areas do not have even a smell of broadband. We keep talking about access to databases and everything else. Some areas are lucky to have an old telephone line provided by Eir and others. In many cases the lines are fed into fields and are hanging into ditches. They are out of control.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_562">— commit to the payment of a "Spring Bonus" for those relying on working age social welfare payments, including pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and lone parents;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_563">— extend the Fuel Allowance eligibility to Working Family Payment recipients, to reach families who are in work on low incomes;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_564">— establish a discretionary fund to provide financial support to households experiencing severe utility debt; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_565">— ensure Community Welfare Officers are available in the community to provide urgent supports and in-person appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I welcome Ryan O'Connor, who is in the Gallery watching these proceedings. </p>
          <p eId="para_567">The cost-of-living crisis continues to bear down on workers and families. Inflation affects everybody but it does not affect everybody equally. Those on lower incomes suffer a greater reduction in living standards given that they spend a greater proportion of their income on essentials such as energy and food. Those essentials have seen the steepest rise in cost over the past year and more, and this is pushing households to the brink. </p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Workers and families have stretched and managed their incomes to the last cent but there comes a point for every family when there is nothing left to cut. This is what we are seeing today in many families across the State. There has been an increase in hardship, financial difficulty and poverty. Almost 600,000 people now live on incomes below the poverty line. The latest report by Barnardos should be a real wake-up call for the Government. The Government should not be second-guessing this report. These are people on the front line telling the Government what it is like in the real world - not in the ivory towers where Ministers sometimes reside. Barnardos found that of the parents surveyed, the number using food banks had doubled to 10%. It found that one in five parents did not have enough food to feed their children at some point in the past year and parents were skipping meals to ensure their children were able to eat. Many of these parents are in work - earning their poverty, as it is now known. This is an appalling picture of life for so many.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Spiralling food prices are compounded by energy bills that are throwing household budgets into chaos. A report last year by the ESRI found that one in three households was living in energy poverty. Behind these statistics are the grim choices faced by households day in, day out; for example, whether to cut back on food or turn the heating off. Over the past two years, the average gas bill has increased by 140% and the average electricity bill has increased by 115%. This is more than double for these households. For those on low or fixed incomes, these costs can simply not be absorbed so something has to give. We are witnessing a tale of two Irelands.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Yesterday the European Commission updated its growth forecasts for this year with economic growth here now expected to reach 4.9%. This was celebrated by many, including Ministers. Some people really need a reality check. They need to come down and recognise the challenges people are facing in their daily lives. What is there to celebrate when a Government cannot convert this economic growth into decent living standards for our people? That is the question people ask. What does it tell us about the health of our society and the performance of this Government when it celebrates high economic growth while the number of parents using food banks doubles and households are plunged into energy poverty? Every parent who is forced to use a food bank to feed their children indicates a failure not on the part of the parent but on the part of the State. Every household that is forced to deprive itself of warmth in the winter months is a failure not of the household but of the State. It is the clearest evidence that the Government has failed to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and that Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are out of touch with the struggles faced by ordinary families day in, day out.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> Action must be taken to address the hardship so many are suffering, to ease the pressure on them and to provide support. The State has the resources to protect the most vulnerable and support those on low and fixed incomes. In this motion, Sinn Féin is calling for the payment of a spring bonus. This is a double payment for those relying on a working-age social welfare payment, for pensioners, for people with disabilities, for carers and for lone parents; some 1.3 million people in total. We are calling for the fuel allowance to be extended to those in receipt of the working family payment in order to support working families on low incomes and for the establishment of a discretionary fund to provide financial support to those experiencing utility debt. This package is not only doable; it would go a long way to support those who are suffering at the sharp edge of the cost-of-living crisis. This needs to be part of a wider package of supports in respect of the cost of living. Any Government that is serious about tackling financial hardship and poverty would support these proposals and implement them. This is what Sinn Féin is calling on the Government to do. We are asking it to bring forward the necessary cost-of-living measures and as part of those measures, incorporate a spring bonus, an extension of the fuel allowance, a discretionary fund and a number of other measures we have identified.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">I saw yesterday how the Government was in celebratory mode. It was celebrating that Ireland has the fastest growing GDP in all the EU. I am sure this news must have come as great comfort for all of those currently struggling to pay their bills. I am sure all those anxiously waiting for the eviction ban to be lifted must have slept a little easier last night. I am sure spontaneous street parties broke out among the 11,000 citizens who are homeless. In the mind of this Government, the boom times are getting even boomier. I am sorry to burst the Minister's bubble but nobody outside of this out-of-touch Government would embarrass themselves by cheering about our headline GDP numbers at a time like this. Maybe Fine Gael has forgotten about the phenomenon known as "leprechaun economics", but the rest of the State has not. Here in the real world, we have families who have to go without certain daily necessities like heat, food and electricity. We have people on low and fixed incomes who have been pushed to the pin of their collar because of inflation. We have renters terrified that the eviction ban is ending and they cannot find alternative accommodation because - guess what? - the Government has not supplied the required housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> That is why we would introduce a spring bonus for those on working-age payments, including lone parents, pensioners and people with disabilities. We would extend fuel allowance eligibility to working family payment recipients to reach families who are in work but are on very low incomes. We would extend the eviction ban so that those who are currently terrified of losing their homes can sleep a bit easier. We would also grant relief to those whose mortgage costs have exploded with the recent ECB interest rate increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> We know that the Government can help those who are struggling. It cannot in one breath tell us how well the economy is performing and then in another, tell us the funds are not there to support very vulnerable people who are being pushed to the pin of their collar because we are talking about real lives. Sometimes we get caught up in statistics but these are people who are really struggling and hurting.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">This motion is very important for hundreds of thousands of families and individuals on low and fixed incomes. We are constantly trying to ensure that every section of Irish society gets some sort of relief during this cost-of-living crisis. We are forced to do this because the Government has been too slow or completely unwilling to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Last week, we put forward a motion for mortgage interest relief. It was rejected out of hand by the Government. Rents in 2022 were 13.7% higher than in the same period in 2021. The average rent at the end of last year was €1,733 per month. It is almost €1,000 more expensive per month than it was in 2011. In reality, we all know rents are much higher than that. Again, when we put forward proposals that included reducing rents and providing real security of tenure, that was also rejected out of hand by the Government. Thank God we managed to block water charges because I dread to think what the Government would be charging people for water at this point in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> This motion is very important for hundreds of thousands of families and individuals on low and fixed incomes, who are under severe financial pressure trying to make ends meet; for the 595,000 people with incomes below the poverty line; for the 10% of parents who are forced to use food banks; and for everybody who dreads the thought of opening their gas bill. The ESRI stated that this has caused a record high of 29% of households to go into energy poverty. This motion is important for the majority of workers and their families who do not have access to the fuel allowance. Even if they did have access to it, applications are taking up to four weeks to be processed. Four weeks in a cold winter is a long time and the Government has still not rectified that delay. For once, it must act in time by supporting this motion and introducing a spring bonus and cost-of-living supports in line with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">When I was putting notes together for this debate, I realised that we had a debate on a cost-of-living motion on 15 February 2022. Twelve months later, unfortunately things have got much worse for people. I commend Deputy Doherty on bringing forward this motion. </p>
          <p eId="para_579">We have to ask ourselves how we are still in this position. Why are energy companies being allowed to profiteer off the backs of severely struggling families? Barnardos was mentioned by Deputy Doherty. Tomorrow at 11 a.m., its representatives will visit Leinster House and I will host them in the audiovisual room. I encourage the Minister and all Deputies to attend. Government Deputies, too, must be hearing about this in their clinics and constituency offices. Everybody is struggling, and none of us can say we are not aware of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> As was mentioned, there has been a threefold increase in the number of parents resorting to food banks, while 30% of parents have reported they have skipped meals to provide meals for their families and children. That is one in five parents stating that within the past 12 months, they did not have enough food to feed their children. On the one hand, there are celebrations over how well the economy is doing; while on the other hand, people are not able to provide basic meals for their children. I am concerned that tens of thousands of lone parents, in particular, will be pulled further into deprivation. One-parent families are predominantly female led, experience the lowest levels of disposable income and are at the highest risk of poverty. That needs to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The fuel allowance, which was mentioned, needs to be extended to recipients of the working family payment because they are, obviously, families on very low incomes. Families cannot pay their electricity bills. This is a continuous issue and people are really struggling. Another issue relates to people not being able to access the community welfare service or to get any assistance or support from it. Moreover, we need to see community welfare officers again based in local health centres, with people able to access face-to-face meetings. That service seems to be totally gone in most areas since Covid, which is being used as an excuse. It is much more beneficial for people to be able to talk to a human being and explain their situation. We have been approached by countless people who are embarrassed to go to the community welfare service or to contact the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, so they ask for our help with that. The Government should hang its head in shame for what it is standing over.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">I commend my party colleague Deputy Doherty on bringing forward the motion. The pressure being felt in every community in the State needs to be addressed in a meaningful way whereby ordinary workers and the most vulnerable members of our society will feel the benefit. We see little to no change from energy providers or on the shelves of supermarkets. What we do see are record-high energy bills and record-high profits for the energy sector, with food and energy companies having more than doubled their profits in 2022. Many residents feel utterly crippled in the face of these bills. The residents of Shelbourne Plaza have been hit with colossal bills in recent months because they were locked into astronomical energy rates by the building’s management company. The Government needs to intervene and ensure ordinary people will not be crucified by high energy prices above the already-high charges such as those in Shelbourne Plaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> We often use figures to reflect the cost of living, but behind every figure is a real person who is being crippled by the energy crisis. Nurses are leaving the country because of high costs and that is having a significant impact on our health service. Earlier I met Amanda Boland and Janice Kiernan. Their dad, Joe Griffin, a 74-year-old man, died in St. James's Hospital on 4 January. They are convinced, and showed me compelling evidence, that their dad would still be alive if staffing levels were the way they should be. The staffing in our hospitals is strained because of the high cost of living, which means nurses are moving abroad. This is the impact that the soaring cost of living is having on ordinary people. It is the human impact of soaring costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> For those reasons, we need the measures outlined in the motion, such as a discretionary fund to provide financial support to households experiencing severe utility debt. We also need to expand the fuel allowance to those in receipt of the working family payment.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">I commend Deputy Doherty on bringing forward the motion. The cost-of-living crisis is biting every community in the country. In my constituency, I regularly deal with people coming to my clinic with various issues relating to bills they cannot pay. Recently, a single mother whose rent has been increased by almost €300 a month came in. She receives the housing assistance payment, HAP, but her landlord, of course, wants a certain amount under the table. She cannot afford to go anywhere else and there is nowhere else to be found that is cheaper than where she is at the moment. She even considered giving up her part-time job to be able to get more HAP to try to cover the payment. There is a crisis throughout the country for many people, and the Minister is aware of that, as all of us are.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I recently spoke to a man working at a filling station who told me there has been an increase in the number of people who no longer fill their tank. They arrive on a Friday or Saturday with a number of five-gallon drums in the boot of the car and fill them with oil to keep their tank topped up, because they can pay for that as they go along. Many people are in a similar position. I recently spoke to the principal of a local school who told me that every year, the school operates a book rental scheme but that in the past three years, many parents have been unable to pay for the scheme and have been asking the school whether they can pay in instalments and sort it out some other way because they do not have the money available. This is a crisis throughout the country for many working families who are doing their best but simply cannot afford these huge increases in energy costs, number one, as well as increased rents and mortgage interest rates. People may have bought a home and be trying to pay for it, but they see more pressure coming on them in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> The Government can afford to do more. Statistics are put out there and there was a mention earlier of the notion that the is economy going well, but summary statistics hide a lot of individual difficulties, and an awful lot of people have individual difficulties. If a millionaire were to move into my home parish, it might appear as though the incomes of everyone in the parish had increased, but that is not the case. The income level would increase only for that one person and that is the tyranny of statistics. The Minister and the Government need to look past the statistics to the reality of people who are trying to survive but struggling greatly, and take on board the measures we have put forward in the motion. They should give a spring bonus to those who are on social welfare payments and try to find mechanisms, as we have suggested here, to help people who are working hard and trying their best but simply cannot afford to live in this economy. They should take on these measures and deliver for the people who need it so badly.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">My constituency, Dublin North-West, has a varied socioeconomic demographic. Those areas of the constituency that are more economically disadvantaged are vulnerable at the moment to the escalating costs of energy and basic foodstuffs. People are justifiably fearful and anxious about their future. There has been a deluge of rising costs across the board, from increased mortgage rates and spiralling rents to rising energy bills and food becoming more expensive, all of which have made it very difficult for many households to keep their heads above water. People have seen a significant fall in their living standards as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that poorer households face an even higher effective inflation rate because they spend more of their incomes on essentials such as energy and basic goods. Pensioners are especially vulnerable and at risk. Better-off households can generally adapt more easily when faced with escalating costs of goods and services by changing their spending habits, spending less on non-essentials or reducing how much they put aside in savings each month. Many poorer households in my constituency are facing extreme hardship because they are unable to keep up with the rising energy prices and the rising cost of groceries. Such households are disproportionately affected by this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The measures the Government has taken so far to help struggling families have not been effective and have not kept pace with inflation or with the increases in energy and other costs. There needs to be an urgent response from the Government to alleviate the hardships of families who are facing this daily. Families are being forced to choose between heating their home or putting food on the table, decisions no family or individual should ever have to make. Proper supports from the Government are urgently needed. It had the opportunity to do this and to help struggling families in budget 2023 but failed to do so. It can now help these families by adopting our proposal for a spring bonus. This would help the vulnerable in our society, who are at greater risk during the cost-of-living crisis and who are most in need of supports. There are long-term consequences for many of these struggling families, not least with regard to their well-being and mental health, as they sink deeper and deeper into debt and arrears. The proposed spring bonus is a measure that would go some way to alleviating some of the pressures on struggling families and individuals and should be adopted by the Government if it is serious about helping vulnerable families during this cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I welcome the opportunity this evening to discuss the important issue of the cost of living. At the outset I would like to make one important point: no party or person in this House has a monopoly on compassion. There has been a worldwide spike in inflation caused by the war in Ukraine and all of us recognise the very real challenges that people and families are facing. People's utility bills have gone up and the cost of the weekly shop has increased. It is not easy for people at the moment. We know that and it is why this Government has taken unprecedented steps to support our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> To listen to the Deputies opposite, you would swear that we had not done a tap and that we had sat on our hands for the last two years and done nothing to help. The reality is since this Government was formed, it has, more than any government in the history of the State, put in place billions of euro in measures to protect and support our people. We did it during the pandemic. Some €18 billion was paid out through the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme. That was €18 billion to support and protect ordinary workers and families. But Sinn Féin dismissed that, just like it dismissed all the other measures we have taken to help people with the cost of living: a €2.2 billion social protection package, the largest in the history of the State; a €12 increase in all weekly payments, the highest increase in payments since the mid-2000s; €1.3 billion in targeted lump-sum payments before Christmas to support our most vulnerable; a €500 working family payment; a €500 grant to support our carers; a €500 grant for people with disabilities; €200 for those living alone; a €400 payment for all those receiving fuel allowance; and double payments in the autumn and at Christmas for all pensioners, carers, lone parents and people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Lump-sum payments of that nature have never happened before and contrary to what Sinn Féin says, the independent analysis from the ESRI clearly shows that the approach taken by the Government means that low-income households are better off than if increases in core payments had simply matched inflation. Do not take my word for it. That is the independent analysis from the ESRI.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> This Government moved at speed to issue those lump-sum payments throughout November and December yet Sinn Féin stands here tonight as if that €1.3 billion package of targeted measures to support our most vulnerable had never happened. Nor does it want to acknowledge the universal measures we have taken to support working families. Sinn Féin has no time for ordinary people who get up every day and go out and do a day's work.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">We know that. That has long been the party's policy. It wants to tax the working man and woman into oblivion. This Government takes a different approach. We want to support ordinary working people and their families. That is why we had a double payment of child benefit and why we brought in three universal energy credits so that families can get €600 off their energy bills. It is why we have reduced income tax. It is why we have reduced childcare costs by 25%. It is why we have reduced school transport costs and the student contribution fees. This Government stands by working families and we will never apologise for supporting them. Sinn Féin wants to abandon them.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I have listened to the Sinn Féin Deputies pontificate about what the Government should be doing. Let us look at Sinn Féin's record. Sinn Féin is the largest party in Northern Ireland and it has been in office there for decades. So what has it achieved? One in five people in Northern Ireland live in poverty. One out of every four children live in poverty. Half of all households in Northern Ireland are facing fuel poverty. That is the record of Sinn Féin in office. The basic state pension in Northern Ireland is £141. The contributory pension here is €265. If you qualify for the fuel allowance and the living alone allowance, it could be up to €320 per week. That is more than double what pensioners in Northern Ireland receive. As far as the two faces of Sinn Féin are concerned, €320 is not good enough for the pensioner in Castleblaney but £140 is more than enough for the man or woman from Crossmaglen. Sinn Féin is trying to ride two horses. It comes in here tonight and it shouts that our social welfare rates are inadequate but it is a very different story when it is campaigning in the North. There it is going around telling everybody how much better off they will be in a united Ireland. Well, it would be better off now when it comes to their pension and social welfare but that would soon change if Sinn Féin got into Government. Its Deputies talked about what this Government did not do in the budget so I am going to have to look at Sinn Féin's budget submissions. Sinn Féin did not propose any expansion of the fuel allowance for older people. It let old people who have worked all their lives go cold. This Government has expanded the fuel allowance in a major way for people over 70 years. Then Sinn Féin Deputies talked about the working family payment when its own budget proposals would have seen thousands of families have their working family payments cut. That is because it did not increase the income thresholds to take account of the rise in the minimum wage. It is the same old story with Sinn Féin. Its sums do not add up. It always forgets to carry the one.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> Its motion spoke of a discretionary fund. This is the third time it has talked about this. The first time it suggested it, it wanted a €5 million fund. Then it proposed a €15 million fund and now it is back again but this time it has not even bothered to put a figure on it, just to set up a discretionary fund: no costings; no criteria; nothing. Now, if a school child handed that in, you would tell them to go back and do their homework. For information, the Government has paid our €58 million in additional needs payments targeted at people in financial difficulties. Sinn Féin always seems to forget one simple fact of life which is that everything has to be paid for. The reason this Government was able to support people during the pandemic, why we have been able to support people over the last year with the cost of living and why we will be able to provide further supports over the coming weeks is due to sound economic management. Unemployment is at a record low. Ireland has the fastest growing economy in Europe. Listening to Sinn Féin speakers tonight, they seem to think that having a strong economy is a bad thing and that it is something to be ashamed of. Do they realise we need a strong economy to pay for all these supports? Sinn Féin cannot even grasp that basic economic reality. At every step of the way, on every policy it has opposed us. None of these supports would be possible under Sinn Féin because its policies are trash and would crash the economy. Sinn Féin is very good at telling everybody how to spend money but it is not so good at telling us where to find it or how to pay the bills. Sinn Féin does not seem to believe in paying some of its bills. You just have to look at the paper today.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Donnelly<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_634">There is one part of the Minister's statement I agree with. I am glad she pointed out the notorious failure of the British state to look after the citizens of the North it has ruled for 100 years. The Minister makes a powerful case for a united Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Workers and families are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis, despite what the Minister said over the past ten minutes. I ask every Member to support the motion. There is no doubt people are struggling to pay their bills and are at the pin of their collar. There is no doubt we need a spring bonus for pensioners, workers, families, those on social welfare payments with disabilities, carers and lone parents. Our citizens are dealing with record fuel bills and rents. Some renters are paying 30%, 40% or 50% of their income. The Minister and I, as well as everybody else, know that is totally unsustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Mortgage interest rates have increased for some people by more than 7% and the Government rejected a proposal from Sinn Féin last week to help them out. It chose not to fully protect people on lower and fixed incomes in the budget. Social welfare payments were cut in real terms due to inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> We can end poverty. It takes a political choice, one which this Government has so far failed to take. A study several years ago by the Irish Heart Foundation found poverty directly leads to early deaths. The evidence is overwhelming. Poverty and pressures on income lead to people making decisions on their healthcare, the healthcare of their children or their bills. They have to make decisions on whether to feed the family or go to the doctor. The working poor make that choice every day. People who get up to work every day make that choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> A study in Dublin West in the Blakestown district electoral division, DED, which covers Ongar to Mulhuddart and Tyrrelstown, shows someone is three times more likely to die of cancer in that area than in the Castleknock area, and twice as likely to die of any other illness. I suspect those statistics have worsened in recent years. </p>
          <p eId="para_639"> It is about choices. The money is there. We expect another Exchequer surplus of more than €6 billion. Measures that would help people include a spring bonus for social welfare recipients, which Sinn Féin is calling for. It would cost €316 million. Despite the Minister's statement - she obviously did not read ours - a discretionary fund for households experiencing utility debt would cost €15 million. There are other things but I will leave it at that because I do not want to take time from my comrades.</p>

          <from>Deputy Réada Cronin<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_640">I am happy to speak on the spring bonus proposal from An Teachta Doherty, which is a care package for people depending of social protection. “Social protection” are not dirty words. Our care package focuses on people in real need: families, lone parents, carers, people with disabilities. It is the opposite of the bonus arrangements and pamper packages the Government devises and delivers for bankers. The bankers Government Members should care about are the increased number of people visiting food banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> In north Kildare, many people do not refer to the cost of living anymore; they call it the cost of surviving, especially where, in real terms, social protection rates are effectively cut because of inflation. With the cost of survival rocketing, it is clear people need a hand from the State but feel they are getting another wallop when their new gas bill has left them floored. Across north Kildare, people are struggling with costs and this is amplified if they are dependent on social protection. Across the State, almost 12% exist on incomes below the poverty line. Barnardos tell us what those of us who read our emails already know, which is that food poverty is getting worse and worse. Up to 30% of respondents in their survey skip meals so their children can eat.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> There is something fundamentally wrong about this. The Government is perverse. We have to think about this. It is all of us. We represent the people out there. This is bad for Ireland and for society. As long as the Government’s voter cohort is still happy, its Members do not seem to care about people being excluded, marginalised and left behind. </p>
          <p eId="para_643"> I know a man living in a caravan backed into a turf shed. He lights his fire in a concrete block outside his caravan to keep warm. He is not in Kharkiv, Türkiye or Syria but in Ireland. We have no war or earthquake, just social and political fault lines where people are ignored, lectured to and diminished in the society the Government is creating: “Keep it up, lads. Keep marching and we’ll march all over you.” It is no way to live and no way to govern. Our spring bonus is essential at this stage and the Government should withdraw its amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">If anyone needed proof of how out of touch the Government is, they got it in spades this evening. I hope the Minister is proud of herself.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> There has been a lot of speculation recently about the Government’s intentions regarding people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. The Government has told homeowners they are on their own if they are struggling to pay their mortgage because it rejected Sinn Féin’s motion on mortgage interest relief. It tells renters that, while it recognises rents are too high, it refuses to implement our proposal to freeze rents and reduce costs to them through a refundable tax credit, which would put the equivalent of one month’s rent back into their pockets. While ordinary people are pushed to breaking point and beyond, the Minister and Government have been busy gaslighting them, drip-feeding and leaking bits of information about what they might or might not do to avoid the cliff edge they have created. At the same time, they tell them they have never had it so good. </p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Then the environment Minister is wagging his finger at people forced to live in energy poverty and warning them they will be weaned off supports they need to keep their homes warm. They are not bold children; they are families who need to keep their homes warm and elderly people forced to go to bed in the afternoon to stay warm. The cold spell is not over and that is why we are calling for an extension to the fuel allowance and a discretionary fund for those who do not qualify but will still struggle to keep themselves warm.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I have been in the Chamber many times while my colleague, An Teachta Kerrane, has raised the issue of community welfare officers with the Minister. The system in place is not working. When they were in the health centres and in the community, they were easily accessible. Now it is a 16-page form and week and weeks of waiting.</p>

          <p eId="para_656">Most constituents who come to me say they are suffering at this stage. A report launched by Barnardos this month shows food poverty is worsening, with one in ten people surveyed forced to use food banks in 2022, while 29% reported skipping meals to ensure their children could eat. Those food banks are not only in Sinn Féin constituencies; they are right across the State. The Ministers should wake up to what is happening to people. People are going hungry under the Government but Ministers are living in a bubble and seem to think everything is fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Average gas bills have gone up by 140% over the past two years, while the average electricity bill has increased by 115%. I do not know what world the Minister is living in but I am getting calls every day from constituents who do not know how they will pay their energy bills, which have gone up by €300 and €400 in the past couple of years. People have been crying out for help and no one is listening.</p>

What does that say about this Government? Tell that to parents who cannot afford to feed their children or heat their rooms. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are completely out of touch with the struggles facing ordinary workers and their families. The Government must commit to payment of a spring bonus for those relying on working-age social welfare payments, including pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and lone parents. They are the people who are impacted at the moment by all these large bills. The Minister needs to wake up and smell what is happening in our country.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">I support the motion. The Labour Party has been leading the way regarding what we perceive to be the reduction or diminution in community welfare officer services at the most local level for a long time now. While many people will easily interact with a freephone number and that will capture perhaps a new audience, many vulnerable people living in rural areas will not have the wherewithal to go to local Intreo offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> I continue to make this case to the Minister and ask that this be looked at again. We need to bring the service to as many people as possible. We have all quoted countless examples to her of what we perceive to be a creeping centralisation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. That scheme is enshrined in legislation for a reason, which is that it would allow for discretion on the part of the local community welfare officer. We feel there is a departmental policy now to try to squeeze that as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The Minister will say an increase of approximately €17 million has been paid out in additional needs. I was never aware of such a specific scheme set out in statute called an additional needs scheme. I always understood it to be an exceptional needs payment and urgent needs payment scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Notwithstanding the fact that an additional €17 million has been paid out, which is acknowledged, the number of recipients has gone up to 97,000. I believe strongly that is a suppressed demand. What I mean by this is that if more people knew the service existed, they would come in to avail of it. Many people still do not know the service exists. We have evidence that where people have tried to engage with the service, they have found it to be cumbersome and overly bureaucratic. That has been the experience in my constituency office. That should be made simpler and more seamless.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> The Minister will say that people have the right to be visited in their homes and the right to engage on a face-to-face level. If there was more of that in the communities at the most rural and local level, and not necessarily housed in or funnelled through the Intreo offices, that would capture many more people in dire need at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I speak not just specifically for the people who would have been recipients on a repeated basis for such payments but the new working poor who are on fixed incomes and whose mortgages and fuel costs have increased. While they are on fixed incomes, they are not able to meet the additional needs in a house and additional expenses that arise. I ask the Minister and Government to take this into account when are considering any proposals. The word "wean" has been used in Government circles. The Government is talking about weaning people off cost-of-living measures in the coming weeks. I ask the Minister to examine the evidence base in the Government's own figures, which were supplied to me in response to a parliamentary question and show that 97,000 applicants availed of more than €58.2 million in additional or exceptional needs payments. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the jewel in the crown that ensures people do not fall below a certain floor and that protections are in place for the most vulnerable when they are needed. Thank goodness we live in this State and that we provide these when we consider other examples around the world where there are no such supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I believe strongly, though, that we have to consider the evidence that is coming forward to us from NGOs and voluntary bodies. Again, the evidence is coming from this House through testimonials by individual Deputies who report back to the Minister on cases with which we are dealing. We need to ensure there is a protection of basic social welfare payments. There is definitely a need to ensure there is an increase to meet the additional cost-of-living increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> If we think about the fact that in 2022, €5.7 million was spent on clothing, €6.6 million on funeral costs, €1.8 million on household bills and more than €7.5 million on general expenses under these schemes, based on the criteria for paying somebody, there is a clear evidence base there that those schemes are vital and necessary. They need to continue and they cannot be cut back. This argument of weaning people off is a very unfortunate use of language by Government. It is very right wing and it demeans people. These are working people in the main who need these payments because they are on fixed incomes. I am not directing this at the Minister. Let me be very clear about that. This idea of tapering down payments at a time when there is clearly a cost-of-living crisis has been used in other Government circles, however. The evidence from the Minister's own figures, as supplied to us in replies to parliamentary questions, is that there is a clear need for these supplementary welfare allowance payments. There is a very clear evidence base for them to continue. I would hope that they will continue and that there will be no effort to wean people off.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> I will return to what I perceive to be the creeping centralisation of services within the Department of Social Protection. I am not asking for the wheel to be reinvented. I am merely asking that the Minister go back to the well. The well spring was always a Department that went out to the people to provide the services to them. It formed relationships with people on the ground. Community welfare officers knew the person with whom they were dealing. They knew their context and were able to make decisions in a very quick time. If, for instance, I was advocating to a community welfare officer on behalf of a constituent, we had that relationship. Thankfully, in some parts of my constituency, we still have that relationship, and I am very grateful for it. We have excellent community welfare officers. If, for instance, a piece of documentation or evidence was missing that would meet the criteria to pay somebody, that could be easily sorted. The person could be put into payment quickly and then come back the next day with the document and everything would be sorted. Now, there are too many hurdles for the individual applicant to cross because the relationship between the applicant and the system has become disjointed in a way that the person to whom the application is made does not have that direct relationship. We need to go back to that. That should be an easy thing to do and resurrect. It is on that basis that we support the motion. However, we will continue to lobby for a proper fit-for-purpose community welfare officer system and supplementary welfare allowance system that does not take the service away in a qualitative sense from the client. This is a customer-facing Department and it must continue to be one.</p>

        <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_692">I welcome the motion from Sinn Féin. It is of paramount importance that we address the cost-of-living crisis with urgency and action. I fear that the gravity of the term "cost of living" is being lost on members of the Government. Perhaps the Society of St. Vincent de Paul captured it better when it talked of the cost of survival, which is experienced in people's homes every single day. If the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, believes this is hyperbole on my part, she should look to the Barnardos report which suggests that 30% of parents in the State are going without food. That is an extraordinary indictment of a country, a State and a Government that is clapping its hands that this is the fastest growing economy in the European Union. All the while, 30% of parents are going without food. This is an emergency but it does not appear to be treated like one.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> More than one in ten people in the State is living below the poverty line, of whom almost 164,000 are under the age of 18, yet the Government does not blink an eye when we say our country is in crisis. Some 690,000 individuals are experiencing deprivation, 200,000 of whom are children, but we sit idly by while families are suffering. We talk of looking after the pennies, while people struggle to put food on the table. The lack of Government action is a slap in the face for those who struggle every day to make ends meet. The average rent in Dublin is now €2,300 for the average person. That is an impossible cost to incur, never mind for the hundreds of thousands of people who are literally living in poverty. The Minister has allowed this to happen, and when the more than justified criticism of what I can only describe as the inept Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage arrives on the Government's doorstep, Government members will all band together in solidarity in the face of the ineptitude shown by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> Living in Dublin is now out of reach for countless workers, resulting in chronic staff shortages across a range of professions, including teaching and in the healthcare sector, to name a few. Students are suffering. Patients are suffering. Everyone is suffering the failed policies of successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments. Just over 1,000 homes were available to rent nationwide on 1 February, which is a 20% reduction on this time last year, yet the Government continues to lie through its teeth that everything is under control and it is all part of some greater plan. It is insulting.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> The Housing for All targets are grossly inadequate, not to mention that they will inevitably be missed by quite a margin. The accelerated delivery of cost-rental homes is the only solution to this worsening crisis. This has been crystal clear for a long time but even that does not budge the Government. It would rather spite those struggling around the country by going down with the ship.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Before the Minister cites the Government's new vacant homes tax as some sort of titanic solution, everyone knows it is far too weak to act as a real disincentive to those sitting on empty homes. In our alternative budget for 2023, the Social Democrats called for this tax to be set at 10%, with a number of fair exemptions. This would send a clear message to those holding empty properties during a housing disaster to use it, rent it or sell it. We cannot separate the eviction ban from the cost-of-living crisis. The ban simply cannot end at the end of March. If it does, our already overrun homelessness services will be decimated. Those who are already in poverty will be pushed further into it. Hunger will become more extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Sadly, housing is only one frontier of the emergency we find ourselves in. The motion highlights the many faces of the cost-of-living crisis. Food poverty is becoming widespread. Nearly 30% of parents are skipping meals just to feed their kids. Food banks are struggling to keep up with skyrocketing demand. Energy poverty has reached a record high and despite meagre initiatives designed to provide relief, families and small businesses continue to endure higher and higher costs that are crippling them. How do we tackle these debilitating conditions? In our alternative budget in September, the Social Democrats argued for the expansion of eligibility for the fuel allowance to recipients of the working family payment. We agree with Sinn Féin's motion that this change is needed now more than ever. While the proposal in the motion for a spring bonus for those relying on working age social welfare payments will be welcome and will put food on the table, it may fall short of the sea change needed to keep up with inflation. While every little helps, pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and Ione parents deserve a boost as much as, if not more, than anyone else in our society. Repeatedly paying out bonuses will not end this emergency. It keeps the wolf from the door for a couple of weeks and then there is a bang on the door again.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> The Social Democrats believe in benchmarking social welfare rates to cover the cost of inflation instead of waiting until we reach a crisis such as the one now being experienced in homes the length and breadth of the country. We must move away from a style of politics that waits for people to undergo hardship, pain and strife before they are adequately supported by the State. We have an ongoing poverty problem that must not be ignored but has been ignored thus far by Government after Government. Countless children are going to school without a warm winter coat. They often have to go to bed hungry and the State is not treating them with compassion. It is simply acting as though they do not exist. According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the qualified child increase, along with the working family payment, contribute most to poverty reduction. As I said earlier in this Chamber, if the Government is serious about combating child poverty, it must raise the qualified child increase by at least €10 for children over the age of 12 and by €5 for children under 12 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> People who are fighting illness or have a disability and are unable to work because of it have the highest risk of poverty in Irish society. Nearly 20% of this group are experiencing poverty, which is a horrifying figure. There is an ongoing need for better assistance for these groups such as further investment in disability services and a substantial cost-of-disability payment, which is essential to reducing the likelihood of individuals falling into poverty. To tackle this crisis head on, our social protection system must be benchmarked to the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, to help those experiencing hardship. The MESL is a standard below which nobody should be expected to live. It allows an individual to live with dignity, meeting the person's needs at a minimum but acceptable level. In its pre-budget submission, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul noted there is a €49 gap between core social welfare rates and MESL rates, and those payments continue to trail by an unacceptable margin. It is devastating that we are so far off this mark. That must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Without a clear pathway to achieving these standards, the Government has condemned more and more individuals and families to poverty. Speaking in Brussels today about cost-of-living measures, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated: "It's important that whatever we do is affordable, that we manage taxpayers' money well, that we make decisions to get the best possible result from the use of public money." I put it to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that the use of public money can be used to stop 30% of parents in families going without food. I can see no greater endeavour for the use of public money. That this does not seem to be treated with the urgency it deserves is absolutely shambolic.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> This Government left €1 billion of taxpayers' money, that is, public money, in an account while people froze on the street this winter, families could not pay their heating bills and parents went without meals to feed their children. While this remains a reality for so many, how can anyone have faith in this Government's decisions that claim to have the people's best interests at heart? It is beyond comprehension. The Government's track record is disastrous. I commend Sinn Féin on bringing forward this motion, which we will support.</p>

          <p eId="para_702">I put it to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that while the Government has put in place welcome measures to mitigate the cost of living, they do not in any way go far enough. We can see this with energy costs and the cost of food and so on. This crisis impacts the least well-off in society who are on low incomes and fixed payments. When people must resort to food banks we have a huge problem. In any society, especially Ireland which is a very wealthy country, to have people resorting to food banks is a complete and utter failure of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> In times of crisis there are people who do very well. The best example would be the energy companies and the very wealthy in this State. The wealthy in this State have never had it so good. Energy companies have never had it so good. One does not have to be a Bolshevik to explain this. If there was ever a time for a windfall tax on energy companies, it is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">There should be no equivocation. These companies are making obscene amounts of money, yet people struggle to pay bills. I do not think anybody in the Government could defend this policy, but there seems to be equivocation from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and, disappointingly, the Green Party. Even the Tories are now talking about windfall taxes on large companies that are making a vast amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> If we want to focus on something even more obscene, it is that the nine richest people in Ireland added €15 billion to their wealth during the pandemic. In the past 18 months, they have become even more wealthy. What does that say? The Government could introduce a wealth tax and bring money back to society for the common good. I do not think that is a hugely radical proposal. It is common sense. Working people are in a continuous economic survival mode in terms of obtaining decent pay, decent conditions, health services, education and so forth. That has always been the case. The fault lines were exposed, not only during the pandemic but during this crisis. Once there is an in-built social inequality and class system, there will always be inequalities whereby the wealthy do extremely well while the working people struggle.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> If people cannot live, they will resist. We have seen throughout history that when people cannot feed their children, they go on to the streets. When that happens, anything is possible. I ask the Minister to give that warning to the Government. People are extremely angry and frustrated. They literally cannot feed their families.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">I accept that the Minister has taken measures, but it is self-evident that they are not working. We have 600,000 people living on or below the poverty line, hundreds of thousands utilising food banks, hundreds of thousands in arrears with their energy bills from last year, and the highest number of people in emergency accommodation that we have ever seen. The numbers mask the reality of the dire housing crisis we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The Minister must do a hell of a lot more but the Government seems reluctant to do so. I thank Sinn Féin for giving us the opportunity to put forward alternative proposals to do that. First, while this is not in the Minister's brief, it must be done. It is insanity and cruelty to let anybody else end up homeless in the current situation. The Minister can stop people going into homelessness but the Government is equivocating. Even the moratorium that was introduced is not comprehensive. I have raised a case on multiple occasions in this House, which is demonstrative of the Government's failures at multiple levels. A woman and her husband are going to the District Court this weekend with their two children. He is a working man, who has worked all his life. They have never claimed anything off the State in their lives. They are going to be evicted from the home where they have lived all of their lives on grounds of sale. They paid their taxes and paid their rent. There are two children, one of whom has special needs, but because they are slightly over the income threshold for social housing, they are not entitled to the housing assistance payment. They are not entitled to social housing. When they are made homeless, which is going to happen, there is an open question as to whether they are even entitled to emergency accommodation. They looked on Daft for somewhere to rent. The family is a single-income one, with somebody working for a well-known semi-State company. There are new apartments just completed on the N11 and the rent is €2,700 a month. That is totally unaffordable. The family can afford €1,000. Jackie told me that if they pushed it, but it would really impoverish them, they could perhaps get that up to €1,500. They are not entitled to anything. There is no HAP support. They are absolutely goosed.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Again and again, I have asked the Government if it will give HAP payments to people whose incomes are over the threshold and who cannot afford stuff, but nothing was done. I asked if the Government would authorise local authorities to purchase houses in cases where people face eviction and are not on social housing lists because their income is slightly over the threshold, but that has not been done. They are goosed. Jackie believes she will be living in her car at the end of the week. Imagine doing that to working people who have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and so on. They are going to end up homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> I will cite another case concerning people on illness benefit who are not given the fuel allowance. I mentioned a case to the Minister the other day of a man who cannot turn down the heating because his wife has cancer. They do not get the fuel allowance because they are on illness benefit and they do not get any of the extra payments. Could the Minister please do something about those things?</p>

          <p eId="para_711">The cost-of-living crisis continues to bear down hard on working people and their families. Barnardos told us last week that one in ten of those surveyed had been forced to go to a food bank in order to provide. Nearly three in ten were skipping meals to ensure their children could eat. The following day, we were told by Kantar that grocery bills are set to rise by nearly €1,200, on average, per household this year. Gas has increased 140% in the past two years and electricity by 115% in the same period, yet when families received their gas bills in January, they were shocked to see they were the highest they ever got, after the cold spell before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> What we should be discussing is the need for an emergency budget, one which would see major increases in the basic social welfare payments, and not on a one-off basis; a major increase in the national minimum wage; and pay increases for working people across the board, at least in line with inflation. The Government might ask how would pay for that. The State has a surplus of €5 billion. Let us look beyond that. We were recently told by Oxfam that there are two billionaires in this State who between them have more wealth than the poorest 50% of the population, yet the Government refuses to countenance the idea of a wealth tax. At the very least, the bottom line for this week must be that there will be no cuts in any of the household cost-of-living supports. The Government says the price of diesel is going down at the petrol pumps and that perhaps the changes could be reversed in that regard, but it turns a blind eye to the fact that the prices are skyrocketing in the supermarkets. A cut in any of these supports will be opposed by our group and should be resisted within society.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_713">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the spiralling cost of living, which is the biggest concern for my constituents coming into spring. Although income tax changes and the cost-of-living supports announced in budget 2023 aimed to protect households from the rising cost of living and the impact of inflation, a survey by Barnardos published earlier this week showed that one in ten people had relied on the likes of food banks or food donations over the previous 12 months. This is more than double the number from the previous survey, which indicates that people are being crucified and the prolonged cost-of-living crisis is causing significant financial hardship to families and businesses throughout my constituency of Louth and East Meath.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> From an economic perspective, we face two enormous challenges, namely, the cost of living and housing. New figures show the State paid more than €58.2 million to 97,224 applicants for expenses such as energy bills, rent, mortgage payments, clothing, child-related costs and financial help with illness. While another electricity credit of €200 is set to come off bills in March, the reduced 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas and the reduction in excise duty on petrol, diesel and home-heating oil are due to terminate at the end of February. This will see the price increase at the pumps.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Many of my constituents face choosing between eating or heating, with 29.4% of households spending more than 10% of their income on home energy needs. People just need to have the disposable income to meet the additional costs of living. On top of this, the ban on energy disconnection is set to end. We need to step in. We need to commit to the payment of a spring bonus for those relying on social welfare payments and ensure that community welfare officers are available in the community to provide urgent supports to households experiencing severe utility debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> I acknowledge the measures introduced by the Government in the budget. In theory, people should have more money in their pockets but due to inflation many families are being pushed into poverty. Costs in this country are spiralling. While one-off social housing and pension payments are welcome, as is the extension of safety measures, such as the extension of the ban on evictions and electricity disconnection, we need to offer hard-pressed families real, long-term supports.</p>

          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the opportunity to speak to this very important motion. I thank Sinn Féin for tabling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I compliment staff in Department of Social Protection offices throughout the country who, since Covid-19 came upon us, have done Trojan work to deal with everything that has been thrown at them. I think it was the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who said last year that when people were struggling they should contact their community welfare officers. That was in very poor taste for the simple reason that everybody who was listening to the Government decided that if they had an issue they could go to their community welfare officer. That has now created a tsunami of inquiries. We have a situation whereby community welfare officers cannot take phone calls or deal with the issues that are being given to them in a timely fashion. No additional resources are being given to these offices. That is a disgrace. At present, people waiting for supplementary welfare might wait up to 12 weeks. That is not the fault of those trying to deal with this. It is the fault of the people who promoted the idea that social welfare officers would solve every problem that every home has, which was unfair on those officers. I wanted to get that out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> We have to focus on what the issues are and how we will resolve them. People who are on fixed incomes are still struggling and any talk of taking away the supports that were put in place in the budget is ill-timed. It would be ill-judged to change those supports at this stage. People who are working and do not qualify for social housing, whose household income might be €36,000 or €37,000 and cannot qualify to get onto social housing lists but then qualify for the housing assistance payment, HAP, should be given meaningful supports. We have middle-income people and families who are working to try to stay in existence. They are trying to hold families together and pay all the bills that are coming in. That is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> My second point is on people renting accommodation. I am a landlord but I see people coming into my constituency office who are saying their rent increased from €900 to €1,600. That is a devastating blow to get. If people are budgeting and struggling at €900, how will they pay for the rest of it? If they cannot qualify for HAP, where do they go to get some help? For people who are renting and getting no other support, a rent credit per month should be put in place to help them get over this financial burden that is on them at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The VAT rate for the hospitality sector should not be increased. If we are to build up our tourism and hospitality services, we need to make sure we stick with those sectors to make sure they can grow themselves back to full throttle again.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> People with disabilities have always suffered. This was well flagged in the Indecon report, which stated that anybody with a disability has an additional living cost of approximately €12,000 per year. We do not take this into account when we talk about the increased cost of living and increasing inflation, but it is important that people who have a disability are given the necessary additional supports they now need in order to try to maintain independence of some sort.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Last week, we talked about mortgage interest relief. People who are brave enough to take out a mortgage and take on the purchase of a house without looking for State aid now need to be given that little bit of a leg-up in making sure they get some tax relief on their mortgages, which needs to be put in place immediately. That could be a temporary measure for the next two to three years until things settle down again.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> The Department has done a huge amount of work and brought in a significant number of schemes. We need to do a lot more, however, and keep much more in place because this problem has not gone away. As long as we have a housing issue that is completely out of control, we will have all the add-on problems we see day to day.</p>

          <p eId="para_725">I thank Sinn Féin for tabling this important motion. People in every walk of life are suffering from the increased cost of living in our country, especially less well-off people who are suffering more and are less able to cope with these increased costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> The increased cost of gas and oil has driven up everything else. If we did what other countries did at the very beginning by capping the cost of electricity and curtailing the amount of VAT on gas, carbon tax and excise that the Government took, the thing could have been controlled much better and the cost of living would have remained basically the same as it had been. It would have made life much easier for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The cost of electricity has tripled, the electricity companies are making triple the profits out of it and the Government is taking increased tax out of it. Yet, as we know today, the cost of making electricity has reduced considerably. We have oil off the Cork coast and gas off the Kerry coast and the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal could import gas more cheaply from western sources. The Government does not want to entertain that because of its green policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Sadly, there is the VAT on the hospitality sector. If the Government increases that, who will pay for it only the consumer? It will hurt the tourism sector. The Government must keep that VAT rate at 9%.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> The Government has missed its opportunities.</p>

          <p eId="para_730">The cost of living is pushing people to the edge. In my constituency that is what they tell me in my clinics during the weekends and over the phone, as many more have said tonight. Electricity and fuel are at exorbitant prices. The Government has done nothing to make sure that that does not impact the people. Businesses are struggling. The Government must signal to the tourism and hospitality sector that it will extend the 9% VAT rate currently applied to the industry. The rate is due to increase to 13.5% in March. The reality is that west Cork tourism and all the indirect jobs that rely on it are simply not in a position to absorb any increase in the VAT rate. If anything, there has to be an extension of the VAT rate and an extension of the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which is due to end in February. If TBESS goes and the VAT rate increase proceeds, it will be nothing less than an economic assault on west Cork tourism, on every restaurant, every hotel, every café and every pub which is struggling at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I can show the Minister of State if he comes down to west Cork. Unfortunately, if you drive around, Friday and Saturday are the only chance to see the doors open in our local community for many cafés and pubs at present. Our local hotels, many of which are family-run, are shuddering at the thought of what is coming down the tracks. This is reflected in data from the Irish Hotels Federation, which recently found that an astonishing 81% of Irish hoteliers are very concerned about the impact of a VAT increase on their businesses as they do not expect a full recovery in overseas visitor numbers until 2026 at the earliest.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Let us not forget our hairdressers, who are also very vulnerable. Their industry, too, has been plunged into major fear of significant job losses and closures across the sector. The Government has said that with the VAT decrease it provided for last year there will be a soft blow. There should be no blow because the decrease should not be taken back this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">I thank most sincerely Deputy Doherty and Sinn Féin for tabling this very important motion. The cost-of-living crisis is affecting people in Ireland in a profound way, especially in rural areas and among farmers. This crisis is characterised by a sharp increase in the cost of basic necessities, such as housing, food and healthcare, while wages remain stagnant. This has left many people struggling to make ends meet and is having a severe impact on the well-being of rural residents and farmers. In Ireland the cost of energy, housing and now food has been a major contributory factor to the cost of living. This is especially true in rural areas, where there is limited access to public transportation and where people often have to rely on private cars to get to and from their places of work and on oil for home central heating systems. The high cost of renting and increased mortgage interest rates are making it more and more difficult for people to afford the cost of housing and are contributing to the growing number of homeless people.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> There is absolutely no doubt but that it is ironic to hear Deputies tonight talk about this and say more should be done while, at the same time, many of those Deputies, including those in the Green Party, are pursuing a policy of putting more and more costs on top of people. We hear people say, whatever they do, not to light cosy fires, in other words, if you have access to turf or timber not to light a fire to warm yourself, whether you are old or elderly or whether it is your way of life and how you want to keep yourself warm. People are told they should not do that and that they should go cold. I am privileged to represent the people in my constituency. I will tell them to light their fires, to do what they need to do to keep themselves warm and to take no notice of what a person up here in a suit tells them to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> It is a disgrace if the 9% VAT rate is not going to be kept to allow the hospitality sector to continue giving a proper service to the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">The Government is taxing the people on its failure to provide alternatives, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, is part of that, as are the lot of other people around here, some of the Independents, who back the Government's policies when it comes time for a vote to put more taxes on the people. Fuel - tax at 50 cent in every euro. The clothes on their backs - tax. The food in their children's lunchboxes - tax. Now the Government is going back to the hospitality industry, an industry that provides a circular economy and local employment and is made up of local producers. What is the Government going to do? It is going to try to put the VAT rate on the sector back up to 13.5%. Who will pay for it? The local people who want to go out to support local hospitality will.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> The Government knows nothing but tax. That explains why it had €5 billion left in the coffers this year, but it wanted everyone in this country to suffer at the hands of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens and the couple that back them at every turn and every vote. The Government took €5 billion in extra tax from every man, woman and child in this country. No wonder the Minister of State is sitting with his head face down and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, left two minutes ago. She was afraid to hear the truth, and she is going around now trying to launch the Government's campaign for the next election, saying they will give people this money and that money. That is Limerick's money. It is Clare's money. It is Tipperary's money. It is not government money. It belongs to the people of Ireland and the Government should have used it to protect the people of Ireland rather than trying to protect its own seats at the next election.</p>

          <p eId="para_739">The genie is out of the bottle. The Government is screwing the people with tax. I will not repeat what has been said, but a person with no education could see it. Tax receipts are booming because the Government has added more tax - carbon tax, extra VAT and everything else. It plays games with money, moving it around here and there like in a game of Monopoly, trying to cod the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I salute the community welfare officers and the social welfare officers who work so hard trying to deal with people. I do not accept the flippant words from a senior Minister one day, when he said, "Let them go to the community welfare officer." First, they have been removed from the country areas. You have to find them in the towns now. The Government is penalising the people every which way they turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> There are two things wrong with this. One is that the Government is taking its orders from Europe or the World Economic Forum, WEF, or wherever else. The second is that Government Deputies are not upholding their duty as elected Teachtaí Dála or the mandate of the Government to serve the people of Ireland. They are not serving them. They have refused to cap the prices charged by the ESB and the gas companies. They have refused for ages to change the toolbox they had from Europe whereby they were charging us all the same price for smelly oil as they were for wind energy. That was another trick. That changed last October, but still the prices have not come down and the massive profits go on. The Government is beholden to big conglomerates every minute of every hour of every day, 24-7. That is what it is doing. It is not representing the people of rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> It has all these ideas such as climate change. You cannot go into any town or village now. They are like airport runways with footpaths the width of half this Chamber. It is such a mockery, with dirty, rotten concrete, and you cannot get money to spend on a bridge. A bridge in Ardfinnan, in my constituency, has been operating according to a one-way system for the past six or seven years, and then there is active travel or whatever the Government wants to call it. What do you do when you end up with no active travel? The people were walking before and they will walk again. Yet they will give Government Deputies their walking boots, their marching boots and their running boots, and there will be no hiding place for those Deputies. The long grass will not be there to hide them either, so it will be a case of off with ye - ye have done too much damage.</p>

          <p eId="para_744"> Two reports have come out over the past month about the everyday reality for people in Ireland. One is from Barnardos, on food poverty in Ireland, and one is from Oxfam, on wealth inequality. They reveal two starkly different experiences of living in this country. Just two people in this country have nearly twice as much wealth as the bottom 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Since 2020, the richest 1% of people have received 63% of new wealth generated, and the bottom 90% got just over 10%. This is while nearly one in three parents skipped one or more meal per week to make sure their children could eat properly, while the richest 1% of people got to hoard 27% of the country's wealth and the bottom 50% had to make do with 1.1% of the wealth. Working-class people are cutting back on food, heating and meals, all in order to make ends meet while the rich make millions off high rents and prices. The Government said a couple of weeks ago that it cannot afford to keep up all of the cost-of-living supports. How much longer can we afford to let the rich's wealth skyrocket year after year, while working-class people's lives get harder and harder? How much longer can we afford to let the rich get richer while everyone else struggles? The fact is that working-class people's lives are getting worse. This cost-of-living crisis is not going away. We are one of the richest countries in the world but we have nearly 600,000 people living in poverty, and this Government is contemplating taking away supports that hundreds of thousands of people desperately need.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> The eviction ban ends on 1 April. If this happens, there will be a surge of tenants facing the prospect of losing their homes. There are 11,632 people already in emergency accommodation, and we know that is the tip of the iceberg. I am already seeing a significant increase in people coming into the constituency office after receiving upcoming notices to quit, which is eviction. We must extend the eviction ban. We saw on Monday that Daft.ie has said that rents have risen by 13.7% in the past year and, more importantly, available places have dropped by over 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> Groceries are up 15% in price, inflation is still at its highest in years and wages are not even nearly keeping up with any of that. People need assistance and they need more help than the current social welfare system offers them. People on social welfare, pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and lone parents need not just temporary supports and payments, but real increases in benefits to match inflation and get them back above water. There is a need for a €15 per hour minimum wage. We need proper, permanent and universal increases in social welfare to get people out of the trouble they are in. Social Justice Ireland and other organisations are consistently calling for a minimum of an extra €8 per week for social welfare recipients, just so people can catch up with this crisis. We know the 12% increase is a cut in real terms because there had not been an increase in 2021. For the last three years in a row, welfare income has fallen in real terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> As has been said, community welfare officers need to be put back into the community, which is an issue I raised over a year ago. It is not good enough to have to sit on the end of a phone for ages waiting to get an appointment a couple weeks from now and then waiting a number of weeks for that welfare payment to come through. We need more community welfare officers, and they need to be in local health clinics where people can reach them, particularly in rural areas where people have to travel long distances to go into the Intreo office. We need the establishment of a specific cost-of-living fund so that community welfare officers can have real discretionary funding for people who need immediate support. Will the Government maintain the reduced VAT rate for gas and electricity after the end of February, along with the reduced rates of excise duty for petrol, diesel and home heating oil? Will it continue the ban on energy disconnections? We need proper targeted payments to those in need, real reliefs for fuel and everyday needs, and real caps on prices to stop the gouging we see in the shops and on the garage forecourts. This is not just about people struggling during the cost-of-living crisis; it is about people who were struggling before it and will struggle after it.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> On mortgage rates, I met a woman this morning who has her mortgage with a vulture fund and she said her mortgage has gone up to €1,550 per month from €1,200 per month. She had to go in and negotiate to extend the length of her mortgage by five years to keep it at €1,200. These are the measures people are dealing with. This country is seeing a massive transfer of wealth from working-class people to the richest in society. We need to end that and we need to reverse it. Oxfam has called for a graduated wealth tax starting at 2%, which would provide an extra €8 billion for desperately needed supports and services for working-class families and communities. The Green Party would have supported that before so why is it not doing it now?</p>

        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_750">I want to thank Sinn Féin for the motion we have before us this evening and I note we also have an amendment from the Government. The Government's amendment lists all of the supports, both once-off and permanent, that it has put in place, and some of those are significant. I know some people who consider that the supports they have been provided with are a type of safety net. While those people are still stretched, they have noticed the mitigating impact of those supports on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, and that is why it is crucial for those people that there is no cliff-edge and that those supports remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> The rate of inflation remains high at over 7%, which is on top of the 8% from last year. While it is stabilising slightly, it has not reduced or gone backwards. The lump sum and extra payments the Government put in place are still needed, just to keep people going. One of the reasons we need to continue many of these payments is that the core social welfare rates have not kept pace with inflation and it has not even been close. That means those relying on social welfare payments have fallen further behind with every 0.1% increase in inflation. This is hitting people hard when it comes to the basics, including food and energy inflation. As the Sinn Féin motion tells us, gas bills have increased by around 140% over the last two years, and electricity bills have increased by 115%.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> The Government should strongly consider the recommendations on the index-linking of welfare payments put forward by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, in a recent report. The priority recommendation in that report is that the should Government adopt welfare indexation across social welfare policy, development and reform as a matter of priority. Crucially, it recommends that qualifying thresholds for supports are adjusted in tandem with indexed welfare payments in order to ensure recipients are not disqualified from the supports they rely on. I understand that this is more of a budgetary matter but when the Government says in its amendment to the motion that it will keep matters "under review", I ask that the indexation of welfare payments would be part of that review.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> It is not just those on social welfare payments who are finding it extremely difficult to keep going. It is also difficult for those on fixed payments such as pensions; not social welfare pensions but class D pensions, for example. I have raised this in the House many times. These are people who, through no fault of their own, are on these pensions that are higher than the non-contributory pension but are still quite low. As they are not on a social welfare payment, they are not able to get, for example, a living alone allowance or the fuel allowance. I recognise that the Minister ensured that a couple earning less than €1,000 per week who are over 70 would get the fuel allowance and that is positive. However, it also needs to be extended to those on the working family payment and those whose income is below a certain level. The levels it should put in place for those over 70 should be a benchmark for those under 70.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I strongly support the call from Sinn Féin to ensure that community welfare officers are available in the community to provide urgent supports and in-person appointments. The in-person appointments are important because the role of a community welfare officer is to ensure the welfare of those in the community who need support. One-to-one support is important to establish the level of need, and where appropriate, to provide adequate supports in the form of a supplementary welfare allowance. This is a service that many people relied on and still rely on. It is their plan B or C and it is not working the way it should. If a community welfare officer is needed to ensure the welfare of those most in need in the community, they must be available and they must have sufficient money to ensure urgent supports are provided, which is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> I want to strongly make the case for small businesses, many of which continue to be hammered by exorbitant energy prices. This is true across all sectors. I make a strong plea to the Government not to increase the VAT rate from 9% to 13.5%. The tourism and hospitality sector is in dread of this move, as are hairdressers. Please do not add to inflation by increasing the VAT rate.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOBrien" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Social_Protection" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection (Deputy Joe O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_756">I thank the Deputies for an engaging discussion on the important issue of the cost of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">As already outlined by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, the fundamental objective of Government policy in this issue is to take action to support our citizens, monitor the impact of those actions, listen to the suggestions from this House and respond appropriately at the right time.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> I want to address a couple of specific aspects of the motion, including how whole-of-government action is responding to combat food poverty and energy poverty. We know that a combination of many factors, such as the war in Ukraine and Brexit, have led to rising food prices, which creates a financial challenge for many households. Like all of the Government, I am acutely aware of this challenge. That is why significant measures, including and outside of the annual budgetary cycle, have been implemented in an effort to protect households. Indeed, recent research from the ESRI shows that lower-income households are more protected after the budget measures than they would be if welfare rates were index-linked to price increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The road map for social inclusion, which is a whole-of-government strategy to reduce poverty, includes a commitment to develop a comprehensive programme of work to explore further the drivers of food poverty and to identify mitigating actions. I established a working group on food poverty to deliver on this commitment. The membership of this group comprises representatives from relevant Departments as well as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Crosscare and the Children's Rights Alliance. We have also looked at good practice from other jurisdictions. The food poverty working group produced a report last July setting out the programmes, services and supports across government that address food poverty. It found that, across government, some €89 million was spent in 2021 on measures addressing and preventing food poverty. The group also developed a research proposal to analyse the prevalence, drivers and possible mitigating actions to address food poverty in two case study areas: Dublin 24 and rural Ballinasloe and its hinterland. The research contract was awarded to Amárach Research and is well under way at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> As part of budget 2023, I was pleased to secure funding to develop and implement a new scheme to support people experiencing food poverty while at the same time drilling into the drivers of food poverty so that we can further develop a comprehensive set of effective responses. The design of this pilot is near completion and the procurement process will be run in the coming weeks. It is simply not right that some people are dependent on food banks. The Government is aware of the issue of food poverty and is taking clear steps to develop an evidence-based model to support individuals and their families who are affected while at the same time addressing the root causes. It is important to note that the hot school meals programme continues to expand. It started with 30 schools and has expanded to 500 schools. There is a commitment from myself and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to continue to expand that programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, published the energy poverty action plan last December. It provides for the establishment of a €10 million fund to further support people in or at risk of energy poverty this winter and into 2023, including people on pay-as-you-go meters. The fund will provide a further safeguard in addition to the supports from suppliers and the additional needs payment operated by the Department of Social Protection. The plan sets out a range of measures being implemented this winter as well as longer-term measures to ensure those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected. The implementation of the new action plan is being monitored by a cross-departmental steering group chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> As an immediate and practical support, the Government has introduced a package of electricity credits in order to combat energy poverty. The package of targeted and broader supports in budget 2023 includes three €200 electricity credits. The total cost of this measure is estimated to be over €1.2 billion and will be applied to an estimated 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts. The first of these three €200 electricity credits was applied before Christmas, the second payment is currently being credited to bills for the January-February billing cycle and the next payment of support will be applied in the March-April billing cycle. Combined with the first electricity benefits scheme from last year, over 2.1 million households will automatically receive €800 of income support through their electricity bill at a total cost of €1.5 billion between quarter 2 of 2022 and quarter 2 this year. The impact of these measures is clear in the data. It shows that the number of domestic customers in arrears has reduced due to both electricity cost emergency benefit schemes. The number of electricity domestic customers in arrears fell in the second and fourth quarters of 2022, corresponding to the roll-out of the first scheme and the first payment of the second scheme. Furthermore, there has been a 30% increase in the number of registered vulnerable customers as a result of a Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, promotion campaign. Registering as a vulnerable customer provides additional protection against disconnection. This is vital, as vulnerable customers can only receive the necessary support if they register with their supply companies. The impact of the electricity credit scheme on households is currently being reviewed by the Department. Work is under way to identify potential measures for winter 2023-24. These measures are in addition to the targeted social protection measures being taken by the Department of Social Protection, including the expansion of the fuel allowance scheme in which €1,324 is provided to recipients over the winter period.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> I reiterate that the Government is keenly aware of the recent price increases and their impact on households and businesses in Ireland. For this reason, the Government acted early - indeed, earlier than most other governments - in providing a response package to the issue early in 2022. In summary, the Government's range of early measures included energy credits; excise and VAT reductions on food and energy; the extension of the lower VAT rate for tourism and hospitality; reducing the caps for multiple children on school transport fees; maintaining the enhancement of the diesel rebate scheme; and reducing public transport fees by 20%. All of these measures help all households but are of a particular benefit to families on low incomes. The Government backed those up with a €2.2 billion social protection measure as part of budget 2023, providing a mixture of targeted lump-sum payments and across-the-board increases in weekly welfare rates. This approach of focusing measures in order that they benefit lower-income households is important because we know that these households have less capacity to absorb price increases. To the extent that prices of basic goods such as foods are increasing, these households are more vulnerable to risk of poverty and deprivation than other households. These measures maintain the trend that is supported by ESRI research of complementing general tax and social protection measures with specific measures designed to support those at higher risk of poverty. I assure Members that the Government will continue to monitor the situation nationally and internationally, including price developments, in planning future actions. We intend to complement broader-based welfare and tax changes with targeted measures, as we have done to date, to support the most vulnerable households at the highest risk of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> I will briefly address some of the issues and questions raised this evening. On the windfall tax, it is imminent. It will be payable on profits from energy companies from last year and from this year. The community welfare service is expanding. There will be an additional 74 staff brought on board within the next six weeks. The Minister for Social Protection will provide a smoothed earnings benchmark report for the State pension to the Government for input into budget 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> I thank Members for their time and engagement this evening. I want to state how important it is to ensure these issues remain a key focus of all Members of this House during a unique period of rising inflation, both nationally and internationally. I feel strongly that it is important to keep the issue of poverty front and centre of the political agenda so that we can continue to prioritise work to eliminate it. I assure Members that all suggestions and proposals will receive due consideration as the Government continues to respond to the unfolding situation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_766">I wish to share time with Deputy Clarke.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> The Sinn Féin motion recognises the pressures facing Irish workers and families. It recognises, in particular, that those who depend on social welfare payments, who include the elderly and people with disabilities as well as those who are seeking work, are worse off today than they were last year. It recognises the reality of the significant numbers of parents who are forced to use a food bank for the first time in their lives. Our motion recognises that, under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, families have faced record-level grocery inflation, which is on top of soaring electricity costs. That is on top of rent costs, which were already among the highest in the western world when this Government came to office and are now so high that some of our brightest and best-educated young people are being forced to move abroad in order to get a roof over their heads. That is on top of the mortgage interest rate hikes that have put many of those who are lucky enough to have bought a home in fear of losing it because Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael refuse to support Sinn Féin's proposal for mortgage interest relief. That is on top of childcare costs, insurance costs, fuel costs and education costs, all of which, for Irish families, are higher than virtually anywhere else in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> The Sinn Féin motion not only recognises these realities, it also puts forward the measures that will give those families a break.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">It calls for a spring bonus payment for those on social welfare, an extension of fuel allowance for those on the working family payment, and a discretionary fund to provide financial supports to struggling families. That is on top of our proposals for working families, including those on mortgage relief, to reduce the cost of motor fuel, home heating, and, crucially, rent and childcare. We proudly stand on the side the Government continually steps over.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> On the other hand, the Government amendment lays bare how detached the Ministers are. There is just one single line in the amendment that refers to future supports. The amendment states the Government is "keeping the cost-of-living situation under review". That is the sum total of it, yet the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has the audacity to come into the Chamber and lecture about the North and deflect in a dozen different directions without offering a single, positive proposition for families who, right now, do not know how they will survive. It all points to a Government that only moves on the cost-of-living crisis when Sinn Féin forces it to do so, and always does so little, so late. It points to a Government that is completely out of touch. It points to the urgent need for a change of Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SorcaClarke" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Deputy Sorca Clarke<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_771">I agree with the Minister on one thing; it is simply not right that people have to depend on food banks. I could not agree more, although, that is probably the point at which we diverge. I listened to what she said. I heard of pilot studies, future plans and everything that may or may not happen in the future, and therein lies the crux of the issue. What the Government is offering people is not solutions or immediate answers. It is a future that has no hope for them that they will see next week. It is an uncertain future. There is no reassurance the cliff edge of supports will not come. Instead, people are hearing the drip, drip of potentials that may come. They are constantly hearing the Government talking about what it is and is not reviewing as opposed to what it is and is not doing. The facts are that workers and families are struggling with record energy bills, rising food costs and increased mortgage repayments. There is not a county that has not been impacted by this. Once again, the Government has been too slow to act. That is another fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> While we do not dispute the steps the Government has taken, we do dispute their impact. We will also have a little bit of a disagreement with the Minister about where it is she needs to go from here. She must focus a support package for those with mortgage interest relief and additional measures for those most at risk, including those on fixed incomes and low incomes. Almost 595,000 people in the State now live on incomes below the poverty line. The Barnardos report has been quoted in this House before and I will do so again. One in ten parents used food banks in 2020. This is a report the validity of which the Taoiseach attempts to undermine instead of taking on board the real stresses and pressures on people. Average gas bills went up 140% in two years. Electricity bills are up approximately 115%. The ESRI estimates the number of households in energy poverty has increased to 29%. Everything is going up. Even when cutting back, the gaps between income and outgoings are widening. Pensioners, people with disability, carers and loan parents are the ones who desperately need this spring bonus. We also need to see the fuel allowance extended to recipients of the working family payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> I do not for one moment blame the staff, who are doing tremendous work under enormous pressure, but there are not enough community welfare officers to go around or meet the demand coming from communities. They need to be better resourced in our communities. Waiting four weeks for a payment that is allegedly an emergency payment is not good enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_774">I thank everybody who contributed to the debate. It is an important debate in a crucial week for households that will in large part determine how they will cope during the rest of the year.

          <p eId="para_776">Sinn Féin has tabled a motion tonight after people have queued for food parcels today. As parents are sitting down wondering how they will feed their kids supper and what is in store tomorrow and next week, they are watching this debate hoping the Government will recognise their hardships and plight. The Minister, who is the Minister for Social Protection not just for the Fine Gael Party but supposedly for the State, failed to address any of that. She showed no empathy whatsoever for people on the breadline. She showed no empathy for the fact, as outlined by Barnardos, that one in ten people visited food banks last year or that one in three of those surveyed have gone without food to make sure their kids could eat. This is the type of Ireland we are talking about. The point has been made that it is great we have a booming economy, but it makes no difference to those individuals if the Government cannot turn a booming economy into real change and real delivery for ordinary people. We cannot have a situation where GDP is growing but the queues at the food banks are growing and doubling.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The strategy from Fine Gael today was to kick the messenger, with the Taoiseach having a go at Barnardos by questioning its survey. We do not have to rely on Barnardos. Any volunteer involved will say the demand on services has increased and that there are waiting lists. They will say it is difficult to keep up with the cost-of-living crisis and the demand on food banks because people were not protected enough by the Government in the previous budget. Let us look at the social enterprise organisation, FoodCloud. In 2021, it delivered 7.4 million meals to charities throughout the State, which subsequently provided the meals to families who needed that type of support through food banks and in other ways. That is the reality under this Government. It is the reality the Minister and the Taoiseach do not want to accept. It is time for them to get their heads out of the sand. People are struggling despite what happened in the October budget. There was a conscious decision taken by the Cabinet that core social welfare rates would not be kept in line with inflation. That is a fact. Core social welfare rates were increased to below the inflation rate. That means people are poorer this year than they were last year. The consequences of that mean more people will turn to charities, soup kitchens, and food banks for support.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> This is the time members of the Government need to understand where people are at. They need to understand the plight. They need to get down from their ivory tower and recognise that not all of them in their little cliques are as protected or as insulated from the cost-of-living crisis as the rest, because there are two parts to Ireland. There are people who are protected and are not worried about the cost-of-living crisis, but there are many thousands, indeed, tens of thousands of families who are under massive pressure. That is why Sinn Féin has tabled the motion, to which the Government did not even respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> There is a need for additional supports. A spring bonus should be paid to 1.3 million people, such as carers, people on disability allowances, pensioners and social welfare recipients. Energy supports should be extended to those working families who have been abandoned by the Government. The policy we put forward to the Government last week should be implemented, making sure those being screwed by mortgage interest rates are protected. The introduction of mortgage interest relief would absorb some of the increased mortgage costs those working families have had to pay. Sinn Féin is coming up with solutions time and again, but what we have is a Government that is tone deaf to the plight, misery and struggles ordinary families are facing in the middle of this cost-of-living crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> I again say the Government needs to get its head out of the sand and recognise where people are at. It should address this by bringing forward a suite of measures, including mortgage interest relief, double payments, extending the cuts to excise rebates, a proper rent credit, the cutting of childcare costs appropriately, and the increase of social welfare rates to a level that will protect the most vulnerable people from inflation. These are just a number of measures a real Government that understands the plight of people, a Sinn Féin Government, would do if we were in the Government's position.</p>

            <p eId="para_786">I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for the question. As I know the Deputy is aware, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has now completed the first stage of an expression of interest process for higher education institutions interested in building capacity in dentistry, pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and veterinary medicine. The second stage of this process has now commenced with the recent announcement by the Higher Education Authority of the appointment of an expert advisory panel to review the opportunities for new programmes covered by the process. The panel comprises representatives from Departments and regulatory and professional bodies who have direct professional experience and-or academic expertise in the relevant disciplines, or knowledge of the higher education system at a senior level.</p>
            <p eId="para_787"> Higher education institutions are, as we all know, autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs and course provision. The accreditation of courses with the relevant regulatory authorities in Ireland and abroad is a matter for individual institutions in line with this autonomy. EU Directive 2005/36/EC provides for mutual recognition of qualifications of a range of professions, including veterinary surgeons, on the basis of co-ordinated minimum conditions for training. The Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI, is the competent authority as regulator with a robust accreditation processes to ensure all veterinary training in Ireland meets international standards. Any programmes, and this is important, deemed viable by the HEA will be subject to Veterinary Council of Ireland accreditation processes to validate them and to ensure high standards of veterinary medicine in Ireland through its accreditation. Such accreditation enables professional recognition in Ireland which then further affords access to registration in the UK, Europe and beyond. As the expert panel is currently reviewing the applications, it is not possible to say at this time how many places may be delivered, although I expect to receive their report next month and will be happy to share it with the Deputy then. The Higher Education Authority will consider opportunities for new programme provision alongside options for current programme expansion to develop a final list of options to present to me next month. My Department will then consider these options having regard to workforce plans and projected demand for graduates from relevant line Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_788"> In short, specifically in relation to veterinary, there is an expert panel in place. Both the chief veterinary officer and the Veterinary Council of Ireland are represented on it, as is the HEA and others. I may get a chance to go through the criteria in my next response.</p>

            <p eId="para_789">I thank the Minister. On to the figures, 302 qualified vets going on to the VCI register in 2022 shows a continuing rise year-on-year in the demand for vets. Some 70% of new vets entering the register were educated outside Ireland. That shows us the extent of the problem we have. We are agreed on that. We are deeply concerned that the panel lacks an independent expert on veterinary education, who has recent experience as a practising vet, to assess and deliver a new veterinary programme that would be appropriately accredited. It is paramount that the new programme for veterinary medicine is fit for purpose and meets the standards set out by the regulatory bodies such as the Veterinary Council of Ireland, as the Minister said, but also the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, RCVS. The Minister has agreed with me on so many occasions that we have to look at the delivery of something like veterinary on an all-island basis. We cannot have an add-on situation. We are at a real crossroads here and we can get this right. There is an onus on us all, and on the Minister, to get it right in terms of what we are going to deliver here.</p>

            <p eId="para_790">I accept the Deputy's challenge. When I became Minister, the view, not just in my Department but also in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, was that we had enough spaces, which I thought was kind of crazy. The only place providing veterinary medicine at the moment is University College Dublin and, as the Deputy quite correctly said, as we have discussed on many occasions before, quite a number of Irish students are studying abroad. By way of example, 208 Irish students are enrolled in a veterinary medicine masters programme in Warsaw and 78 Irish veterinary students are enrolled in Wrocaw University in south-western Poland, and so on. I think 190 students are in Budapest. Slovakia attracts a smaller number, according to a combination of media reports and reports available to my Department. Yet we only have University College Dublin providing the course here. I am not suggesting the Deputy is doing this, but what we really must not do is to suggest it is about one institution over another. What we have here is a horizon scanning exercise. I stand over the expert panel, which includes the chief veterinary officer and the Veterinary Council of Ireland, and its credibility and authority. It will do its work and will report to me in March on what can be done within existing programmes to expand this and on whether new schools can be created. We will see what that menu of options gives us and will take it forward in March.</p>

            <p eId="para_791">Given the level of investment required here, it is vital to get the education quality and the accreditation standards right from the beginning. I am not naming any one in particular, but the institute or the institutes, because there could be collaboration between North and South, tasked with delivering the course must have the capacity to deliver from the get-go. That is the bottom line. They must be able to attract and retain the best quality teaching staff and they must be able to cater for the veterinary needs of the whole island. They must achieve the VCI and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons accreditation standards, particularly as a policy change is expected next year by the RCVS to move away from the European standard there. Vet practices operate across the Border. We need to ensure that this continues. The new vet school needs to be capable of meeting those standards. Most important is the scale. We have such a severe shortage of vets here that the initial minimum intake of any course provider must be approximately 80 students with the capacity to expand to 120 in the short term. We should also be looking at developing the graduate entry routes to expand access. I am confident we can get this right if we do it in the way it needs to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_792">We will get it right because I would imagine the best people to tell us what is needed in terms of veterinary qualifications are the chief veterinary officer and the Veterinary Council of Ireland and they are on the panel. I would not be so rude or arrogant to suggest that I or indeed other individuals with views on this outside the House know better than they do. I have very clearly outlined in the answer that there is an accreditation process. Even after the HEA process does its work, there is still an accreditation process that has to be gone through in terms of meeting standards. However, let us be honest, and it is important to be. There are different people, although not the Deputy or myself, with different views as to which college or university it should be. I am happy for the expert panel to determine those options. I am happy to have confidence in the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the chief veterinary officer, just as I trust the Chief Medical Officer in medicine or the chief nurse in nursing. That has always been the approach we have taken. It is not my job as Minister in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Innovation, Research and Science to regulate or decide the regulatory professional standard. That is the job of the Veterinary Council of Ireland as the regulatory body. However, we will get it right; I agree with the Deputy on that. We need to be careful. The good news here is that there is a lot of competition, which is a good thing. There is a lot of interest. I am happy for the expert panel to do its work, independent and external of me, report back in March, and then in a very transparent way, stand over the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_795">As I am conscious this is the first time we have had an opportunity to take questions on fees in college since the passing of Deputy Ó Ríordáin's colleague, and our former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to her and extend my condolences to her family, friends, to her Labour Party family and to the Deputy. Anytime we talk about fees, I am conscious of her very strong legacy. While the Deputy and I might debate how best to get there, we share a view that we need to do everything we can to reduce cost as a barrier. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. </p>
            <p eId="para_796"> As the Deputy knows, the Government has introduced a range of measures to support people with the cost of living. As part of this, we introduced a significant package to try to reduce the cost of going to college this year and the package provided for adjustments, including once-off measures. This included a once-off reducing of €1,000 in the student contribution rate payable by students eligible for free tuition fees under the Department's free fees initiative for this academic year. A key principle of the design of the free fees initiative is to encourage progression, that is, to support students in progressing through their chosen course of study from year to year.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">As a result, students are not typically supported under the free fees initiative for a repeat period of study or a different course at the same level.</p>
            <p eId="para_798"> While I feel there are a few anomalies we need to address, in terms of students who move from one course to the next, the age at which they can move and the length of time they need to be out, it is a statement of fact that at the moment the free fees initiative does not allow for a repeat period of study or another first or second year. As a result of that, the students who are in such a situation did not qualify for the criteria set down by the scheme. It is that honest an answer, while I understand their frustration.</p>
            <p eId="para_799"> We have moved to try to support students in other ways through significantly topping up the student assistance fund to over €20 million for this academic year, the highest amount ever provided for under the fund. We have also made sure that students now qualify for the rent credit, which was not necessarily clear on budget day. We made sure it was through the Finance Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_800"> There was a once-off reduction of €1,000 in the contribution this year. As I said on budget day last year and will say again, we are only warming up in terms of reducing the cost of education and fees. I will certainly reflect on those involved in repeat study as we prepare for the next Estimates process.</p>

            <p eId="para_801">I very much appreciate the comments of the Minister on the former Minister, Niamh Breathnach. I know her family will as well. One of the radical things she did as Minister for Education was to abolish fees, something from which I benefited, as did many of my colleagues and friends. The debate was lost over the previous 25 years when registration fees crept up. People are now spending thousands of euro a year on fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> Be that as it may, we are talking about a small cohort of students. It was a welcome measure. I know there is frustration in government that when something is announced there will always be a member of the Opposition who will say it is all very well but it should be tweaked more and the focus is on the negative. What the Minister did was welcome and things are going in the right direction. The Minister is making all of the right noises in terms of reducing third level fees to where they were 25 years ago. Does the Minister not feel that an additional measure or gesture could be made from Government to reduce the fees of a small cohort of students by €1,000, in line with everybody else?</p>

            <p eId="para_803">I take the point the Deputy has made. In an ideal world this is an area I would like to move on. I am constrained by the decision that we made to hinge this on the free fees initiative. I must be honest; a number of students fell outside the qualifying criteria, namely, students attending private colleges or colleges that do not qualify for free fees or who repeated a year in the same course or a different one.</p>
            <p eId="para_804"> It is a thread that if I pull has more budgetary consequences than one might think looking initially at any one measure in isolation. It is something I will keep under review through the course of the year. Last year there were some underspends in SUSI and the like. If there are measures I can take later in the year, I will certainly consider that. We will make sure all of the funding allocated to assist students is spent and there if room to address this later in the year it is something I will keep under review. </p>
            <p eId="para_805"> We will publish a cost of education paper a lot earlier this year than we did last year in advance of the budget on the further options we can take to reduce the cost of education. We can tease through these issues then.</p>

            <p eId="para_806">Over a period we want to achieve, at all levels of education, be it primary, secondary, third level and further education, a situation whereby nobody has to consider costs when it comes to furthering their education journey. It should never come into the conversation. It is depressing that people always have to think about the cost of education to a family when it should instead be about trying to fulfil their potential. However, when there is a price tag attached and question marks over whether a family or individual can reach that price, we have failed collectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_807"> If he cannot address this now, can the Minister ensure in the next budget recycle, as we move towards a new announcement in September, that all of the loopholes will be dealt with and this cohort of students will benefit? If the Minister could not do it this time, can he commit to reviewing the current system in order that students who start first year again can be included in a further scheme?</p>

            <p eId="para_808">I am uncomfortable with how repeat students in general are treated by the system because there can be a whole variety of reasons somebody starts one course and wishes to move to another. That is life. Things can happen in somebody's family life and in terms of health. There are reasons people have to move. I have an openness on that..</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> I spoke about a once-off reduction of €1,000, which is true. We have made a permanent reduction of €500 in fees for anyone earning less than €100,000 in terms of family income. That is a mechanism I want to build on in future budgets. Could the €500 figure change or the €100,000 figures go up a little more to make sure that two public servants married to each other do not fall just outside the gross income limit? We can consider things within that formula. </p>
            <p eId="para_810"> SUSI needs an overhaul. We need to make sure that the means test is not too mean. I want to take another look at that in advance of the budget. An overhaul of SUSI and continually trying to reduce the fees are the two areas on which I am going to focus. We will publish a cost of education paper in the autumn. </p>

            <p eId="para_813">I am happy to come back on that issue and engage with the Deputy. There needs to be absolute clarity on that. I want to deal with the student accommodation question first.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> I am actively aware of and working to address the difficulties faced by students. While I understand the Deputy's question refers to a lack of agreement on Government support, I have to make the point that this is the first time in the history of the State that the Government has intervened directly, for better or worse, to part fund, with taxpayers' money, the building of student accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_815"> Fundamentally, the challenge of student accommodation is one of housing supply more generally. Obviously, the outbreak of war in Ukraine has compounded the impact of Brexit, Covid-19 and the cost of construction. We are all familiar with these things. The higher cost of finance has also contributed significantly to the overall cost of new projects. A number of higher education institutions had to pause their student accommodation projects as a result of these challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> To assist in restarting the projects, on 29 November 2022 I secured Government approval to develop short and medium-term policy responses to activate a supply of affordable student accommodation. These landmark policies will, for the first time, see the State providing financial support for the construction of student accommodation. They will ensure the increased availability of and promote greater access to student accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_817"> The short-term focus is on projects where planning permission is in place and designs are at an advanced stage. The Government has approved funding support to develop accommodation for students of the University of Limerick, Maynooth University and the University of Galway. These projects were not undeveloped due to a lack of agreement on Government support; rather my proposal now enables these universities to reactivate the projects that were stalled. Those projects have been approved by the Government and we need to get on with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_818"> My Department is also working with the Office of the Attorney General to address EU state aid requirements. As the Deputy will know, two other universities, namely, Dublin City University, DCU, and University College Dublin, UCD, had advice planning permissions and their projects have been paused. I have had two meetings with each university in the course of the last month and I expect to be able to update the Government on how I believe we can move forward on this project shortly. I am pleased to tell the Deputy that Trinity College Dublin, TCD, recently received planning approval for an accommodation project and we are now engaging with the university. I am engaging with six universities. Three of the projects are over the line in terms of funding as of November, namely, DCU, UCD and TCD. In parallel, we have allocated €1 million to the technological universities to come up with their plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">I thank the Minister. It is vitally important that these projects are progressed sooner rather than later. The Minister knows I have pushed for a long time for public funding for student accommodation because it is integral to students participating in third level education, in particular students from rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_820"> How is the Minister making sure that the beds will be affordable once they are available? We need to make sure that it is just that a number are ring-fenced for SUSI students or whoever; they should all be affordable. That needs to be the bottom line when money is invested.</p>
            <p eId="para_821"> My colleague has a question on the rent tax credit. The current situation is not good enough. The requirement for landlords to be registered with the residential tenancies board, RTB, excludes many students. Students are being punished because their landlords are not registered with the RTB. We need to tease that out in another question.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">That has always been my understanding. I am happy to clarify that and work through that with the Deputy. That was certainly my understanding but I am very happy to seek clarity that my understanding is correct but that has always been my understanding concerning the rent-a-room scheme. </p>
            <p eId="para_826"> Landlords need to be registered with the RTB for very good reasons, including the protection of tenants. An issue raised with me by USI and others is the importance of RTB registration. I will clarify that for the Deputy. I am happy to do that because it is not within my Department's remit. </p>
            <p eId="para_827"> The Deputy and I support public investment in getting these projects moving. Whatever funding we are investing, we expect that level of funding back in terms of the percentage of rooms that will charge below market rates. We are doing this to ensure we are in compliance with EU state aid rules but also to ensure that if the State invests €1, it makes sure these things are below market rent.</p>

            <p eId="para_828">Affordability is crucial. As this is the first time there has been public investment in student accommodation, we must get it right from the beginning to meet the affordability criteria. There is no point in having student accommodation or any type of accommodation if it is beyond the reach of ordinary people so we must get it right.</p>
            <p eId="para_829"> I wanted to get clarity because this is not what has been coming from Revenue. Anyone renting under the rent-a-room scheme, whose tenancies are obviously not registered with the RTB, will get a rent tax credit. I am really glad the Minister has cleared that up. There are a few other exclusions we will talk about later.</p>

            <p eId="para_830">In the interests of accuracy, the rent tax credit scheme is run by the Department of Finance so I am offering information to be helpful as I know it to the House as opposed to being accountable to the House for the administration of the rent tax credit scheme, which is done by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> I agree with the Deputy about affordability but I also think there is a real focus on the issue of supply. We know that even at current rates, on-campus accommodation is over-subscribed. From memory, for every one bed that was rented in Maynooth on campus, there were five or six students who would have rented the bed so I see it as a twin-track issue. It is about supply because, and I am not saying it is easy, there are students renting existing accommodation on campus so we need more supply but we also need to make sure that affordability is to the forefront, particularly in any public investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">I acknowledge that this is an issue that Deputy Pringle raised with me on a regular basis and that the Killybegs campus is important to him and his community. I expect to be in a position to establish very shortly a regional campus support fund. There are a number of campuses that the Deputy and I believe are integral to regional and local access to third-level institutions. I would consider Killybegs to be very much in that category. To be frank, sometimes they can cost a bit more to run but there is a public good in them continuing to be there and we want to do that. We have been doing it but we have been doing it in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner in terms of sustainability. It would be better to get to a place where we just knew there was an annual regional campus support fund that certain institutions could draw down from and almost be guaranteed funding from. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on that in the next couple of weeks. Without pre-empting it, I would be surprised if Killybegs is not in a position to benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_835"> ATU Killybegs campus plays an important part in delivering on ATU's educational and innovation mission in Donegal and the region. It has played a particularly critical role in providing skills for the tourism sector and I understand from an update from ATU that there are plans to develop its contribution to the food science discipline within ATU.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> The campus also plays a critical role in the wider economic development of Killybegs and its wider region. This is the core of the mission of technological universities in general. The Enterprise Ireland-funded Killybegs marine cluster has made significant progress since its establishment two years ago. There is significant potential for the cluster to further support the development of these marine industries with particular opportunities in the emerging wind and hydrogen sectors off the north-west coast of Ireland. ATU sees this as an area of major potential in the years ahead and one that will engage the entire university's capacities across education and training, research and enterprise development. The campus in Killybegs is regarded by ATU and my Department as a significant enabler to achieve this in partnership with local industry, Enterprise Ireland, the Western Development Commission and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> I am also aware that ATU is working closely with a range of partners to contribute to the development of Killybegs town and harbour. A key area of engagement is the Ocean Innovation Centre and I know that the university is working with Donegal County Council on plans for the refurbishment of Island House, which will become a digital hub and tourist office.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">What the Minister said about the regional campus support fund is very welcome. Hopefully, Killybegs will be in a position to avail of that because it is very significant and very significant for smaller campuses. One of the problems in Killybegs over the years was trying to attract funding as a very small part of Letterkenny Institute of Technology but it is a more integral part of ATU, which is very important. That regional campus support fund will be a very useful and welcome development. I appreciate that.</p>
            <p eId="para_839"> As the Minister outlined, it is true that Killybegs has a tradition in culinary arts, has done very well in this area and has a very high reputation going back years when it was a CERT college. That needs to fostered and developed and the funding could do that. Working within the marine cluster is very significant and shows the potential for the future development of the college so that is very important and I am glad that it is integral to the Minister's thinking.</p>

            <p eId="para_840">I want to get to a place where the people of Killybegs and the Killybegs campus can be certain not just about their future but about the fact that they are not a peripheral part of a university but instead have a core role. The comments I have received from ATU regarding its view are very encouraging. I am also told that ATU is working with the Donegal local enterprise office and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to look at how we can support the development of Killybegs and south-west Donegal. The Killybegs campus has been in receipt of capital funding of €1.8 million in recent years. I understand, and the Deputy knows better than me, that this has enabled significant building upgrades, some of which I outlined. Crucial to all of this is the ATU strategic plan. It must under the Technological Universities Act put a plan in place for three to five years. It must be provided to me, the HEA and QQI and must be published. ATU is developing its first plan. It met with staff in Killybegs on 21 January and is due to meet the Killybegs campus again on 14 March. I know that the information I have shared with the Deputy is an indication of what ATU's thinking is as it begins to develop this plan but there is an opportunity for people in Killybegs to continue to feed in with 14 March being the next Killybegs campus meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">One thing that is very important to Killybegs is facilitating and enabling students to return to third-level education. I know a few people who have gone back into education. People who would not have completed secondary school have gone into further education 20 or 30 years later, which is very significant. It is also very important for Donegal because over the years, it lacked people with third-level qualifications. The ability of people to go back into further education and restart their education is very significant. The college and that particular campus have a significant role to play in that and I would like to see that continue and develop over the next couple of years.</p>

            <p eId="para_842">I agree with all of that. I hope the Deputy can take some encouragement not just from what I say but, more importantly, from what ATU is telling me. It is highlighting tourism education and training as a key role for Killybegs. It acknowledges that the campus there has a long tradition of excellence in the area and talks about anticipating development in food science in Killybegs given its location and access to raw materials such as marine protein. It is also talking about the Killybegs marine cluster and its role, and that of Letterkenny Institute of Technology before that in working as part of that culture to develop further partnerships and the work they are doing with Enterprise Ireland in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_843"> From what I am hearing from ATU, I am very satisfied that it is very clear on the important role Killybegs campus is playing and will play and it looks to me as though ATU is envisaging a much bigger role as it develops. The strategic plan is the first opportunity to publicly knit together the new technological university and satisfy public representatives and the people of Killybegs and Donegal of their place in this new educational landscape.</p>

            <p eId="para_845">Does the Minister have any plans to allow students who are in receipt of SUSI grant funding to work at weekends? We know how important that is and he has made changes for people and families. This would enhance students’ work ethic. Moreover, families and students are stretched beyond belief by the cost-of-living crisis. Students should be allowed to work within the scope of their application without being punished.</p>

            <p eId="para_846">Not to upset the Deputy, but I think I agree with him on this. His suggestion makes logical sense. There is always a balance to be struck between the importance of encouraging full-time students to focus on their studies, the integrity of their education, etc., on the one hand, and the real world, on the other. In the real world, many people work in part-time jobs, perhaps doing a shift in a bar, in a supermarket or wherever at weekends. Many people probably need to do so, and I am conscious of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> As the Deputy noted, we have made a number of changes. The main financial support to students is the student grant scheme known as SUSI, which is means tested. Under the scheme, holiday earnings, as they are called, that is, the income a student has earned outside of term time in the previous tax year, can be deducted from the total income assessed up to a maximum level. For students in the current academic year, the maximum level is €4,500, but I increased that in the budget for the next academic year to €6,552. From September, therefore, students will be able to earn €6,552 and disregard that from their SUSI application, up from €4,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_848"> The point the Deputy makes is a good one. We need to go further on this. In that context, I have asked my officials to prepare a paper for me in respect of it. The idea of regular weekend work, a core component of many students' lives, is something we should reflect. We have done it for the holiday time and increased the threshold, which I am pleased we did, but I would like to see us go further. As I have stated previously in the House, I will publish an options paper in advance of the budget. However, he Deputy can take it that making progress on this is issue high on my priority list.</p>

            <p eId="para_849">In the first instance, I thank the staff of SUSI - and, indeed, Geraldine in my office - who do tremendous work in assisting families. We discussed this matter at a meeting with the Minister regarding the South East Technological University in the audiovisual room last October. At that time, he stated that students were allowed to earn only €2,000 during a summer. He indicated he would increase that limit, and he did so. I acknowledge that and thank him for it. The figure was increased from €4,500 to €6,552, which was very welcome and deeply necessary. He did what he said he was going to do, so I acknowledge that and thank him for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> I know very well some of the towns in the Minister's county, Wicklow. The hospitality industry there employs students and it works both ways. The industry needs students and the students need the work. Allowing them to get a few extra bob, pocket money or whatever takes some of the pressure off families, who are hard pressed at the moment. I am glad the Minister has asked his officials to look at this.</p>

            <p eId="para_851">As the Deputy said, he was successful last year in highlighting the issue of holiday earnings. We heard him and other colleagues and acted on that because it was a sensible step to take. I do not want students to be looking at their payslips and worrying that, if they work, within reason, an additional shift at the weekend in a local bar, hotel or supermarket, it will push them out of financial support, to the point where they might decide it is not worth their while continuing with their studies, or that they cannot take the job, at a time when we have shortages especially, but not exclusively, in the hospitality sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_852"> This is something I am looking at. We have made the change from under €5,000 to more than €6,500, but I would like to go further. The Deputy's suggestion in this regard is reasonable and sensible. In preparing for the Estimates, I will see whether we can build on the progress we have made.</p>

            <p eId="para_853">I appreciate that the Minister's officials are examining the matter. It would be wonderful for social cohesion and everything else, given jobs can instil a good work ethic in students whereby they will understand the value of work, as their employers do. In fairness, the vast majority of employers and employees have a good relationship. There may be the odd rogue employer and they should not be supported at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> It is very positive and good for students to be able to work. I was a student at third level, and I know how it goes.

            <p eId="para_856"> The serious point in all this is there is a cost-of-living challenge for many people, and I accept there is a cost to going to college and to education. I also fully accept there are many people, in both rural and urban Ireland, who are looking for somebody to work in their pub, hotel, supermarket, shop, pharmacy or wherever else. If it is possible to do both, as I think it is in a certain way such as weekend work, I do not think students should be overly penalised in the context of their SUSI grants. I will try to make more progress on this in the Estimates in the autumn.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I acknowledge he was one of the people most strongly agitating and advocating for a review into PhD conditions and I am pleased that is under way. The purpose of the review of PhD supports is to contribute to the development of a set of national guidelines for supports for PhD researchers that fosters a consistent standard of experience. That lack of consistency is something about which I hear a lot of frustration from PhD researchers. This is a key commitment in Impact 2030, the national strategy for research and innovation published in May last year. About 11,000 people are undertaking PhD studies in Ireland at any time. In the context of the cost-of-living crisis, there was an urgent need to bring forward the implementation of that commitment in order that PhD supports would be fit for purpose. The review will build on the previous work on reforms in the tertiary education and research system, including the national doctoral framework, student supports and the equality, diversity and inclusion agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_860"> Officials in my Department identified a shortlist of persons with the appropriate high-level experience to oversee the review. The experience identified as most appropriate included talent and skills management, research careers, high-level skills development and human resource management, industrial relations and public service management. People were then approached to see whether they would be willing to serve in that role, noting the urgency in establishing the review. Mr. David Cagney, recently retired as assistant secretary and head of Civil Service HR in the then Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and Dr. Andrea Johnson, vice president of Workhuman and chairperson of Women in Technology and Science, both agreed to serve.</p>
            <p eId="para_861"> I was very pleased with the calibre of these individuals. I felt that having one person with significant experience in human resources and the Civil Service who understands the system, as well as a strong and powerful female leader in the area of women in technology, science and research, was a good balance, with one person who is used to the system and another who is used to research, and with one person who is male and another who is female, and with both them having qualities in a variety of other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_862"> In line with established procedure, my Department obtained sanction from the then Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to pay each co-chair a <i>per diem</i> rate of €200 for up to ten days for their work on the review. There is no salary, therefore, but rather expenses of up to €200 capped at ten days per year. I am delighted that two so highly qualified people as Mr. Cagney and Dr. Johnson agreed to conduct this review urgently and at an extraordinarily modest cost, having regard to the importance of the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">My intention in tabling the question was to find out facts, so I do not really have anything to debate, although I do have a request. Will the Minister engage with the chairs to see whether they will meet the soon-to-be-formed postgraduate workers’ organisation as the body that will represent PhD researchers? If the Minister has not met representatives of an earlier iteration of this group, I strongly suggest he do so. They are an incredibly engaged, active and willing people who are seeking to broaden and expand who gets access to research, especially among postgraduates such as PhD students, which has, regrettably, tended to be an exclusive domain. Widening that franchise will be very important in getting the most out of research in this country in a way that will benefit all of us.</p>

            <p eId="para_864">I thank Deputy Gannon for raising this important topic. Will a more formal consultation process take place later in the review process and include the stakeholder engagement? We are concerned that at the moment, it is more of a scoping exercise without a consultation paper and that submissions are not actively being sought. I join Deputy Gannon in urging the Minister to request the chairs of the review into PhD conditions to contact the postgraduate workers’ organisation, when it is formed, and meet it as the body that will represent PhD researchers? It is awfully important that there be proper consultation and that the Minister meet with that group, which will be highly co-ordinated and active on this and will know what needs to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_865">To be crystal clear, one of the first acts of the chairs will be to meet with those groups. I will have to check if I have met that group but I have met postgraduate representatives from the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and a group of postgraduate researchers from Trinity College Dublin who made a strong and compelling case about the need. I am meeting the co-chairs next week. The first item on our agenda will be to discuss their engagement with the representative bodies for our PhD researchers. I have no difficulty meeting that group. I am very happy to do so. It is most important we get them meeting the co-chairs because I want this work to be done, done well and for them to have confidence in it. As people know, the scope of the review includes current PhD research supports, including financial supports, stipends, SUSI supports and others; the adequacy, consistency and equity of current arrangements across research funders and higher education institutions, including equity and welfare considerations, the status of PhD researchers, whether student or employee, and a review of international comparators and models; the impact on funding of research supports of any adjustment to current supports; graduate outcomes; and visa requirements and duration for non-EU students. The review will look at issues of adequacy, taking account of cost and other issues. This is a very important piece of work with quite broad terms of reference. The engagement will happen and they will be formally written to very shortly to confirm that.</p>

            <p eId="para_868">I thank Deputy Carthy for his question and note his interest in it as an agricultural spokesperson. I want to get this right. I recognise there are two issues my Department must oversee. One is to make sure there are enough places to meet demand in the country. We have identified veterinary, dentistry, nursing and medicine as areas in which we wish to expand the number of places. We must also ensure, separate and distinct from that, that the number of Irish students who have to go abroad is reduced. I could never understand how there was a scenario in this country where official Ireland would say we had enough spaces when every year all these students found themselves having to go abroad. We only had one university in Ireland providing veterinary medicine. It does it very well and it is very sought after but there is only one.</p>
            <p eId="para_869"> The purpose is to scope out what higher education institutions could offer were they funded to do so. The existing number of places could be increased, and it would be entirely appropriate for an existing school to come forward and say it could do more, or there could be additional schools, or there could be both. There seems to be quite a lot of interest in this. There is also quite a lot of talk among vets about this and a real sense we could see at least one new veterinary school established. There is also a lot of regional interest in this. There are different views, as there will be among any group, as to who should house the new school or schools if they are to come about. The process we have put in place is robust and external to me. An external body has been set up through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, that includes the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Veterinary Council of Ireland. I hope that gives the Deputy confidence. I am not qualified to determine the most appropriate veterinary medicine courses nor is my Department. We listen to the regulators and the professional bodies on that just like we listen to the Chief Medical Officer on medicine places or the Chief Nursing Officer on nursing places.</p>
            <p eId="para_870"> On Northern Ireland, I and Deputy Conway-Walsh have done quite a bit about how we can continue to develop third level education on an all-island basis. We want to see that happen. It simply makes sense. I am satisfied, through the note given to me, that any programme deemed viable by the HEA will be subject to Veterinary Council of Ireland accreditation processes. EU Directive 2005/36/EC, which provides for the mutual recognition of qualifications of a range of professions, including vets, would ensure anyone who qualifies in a programme here has their qualification and registration recognised in Northern Ireland, the UK, Europe and some other jurisdictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_871">The Minister is correct. I have a set of figures, I think for 2022 but it may be for 2021, which show that just 30% of newly registered vets in Ireland pursued their studies in Ireland and that 70% came from elsewhere. Frankly, we need to flip that on its head. We could and should become a world leader in veterinary practice considering the excellent family farm model for which we are renowned and, for that matter, the great effort put in across the agrifood sector, which holds a dominant place within the Irish economy and society. Nobody is questioning any of the membership of the expert panel. I am asking for clarification on whether the expert panel has sought interaction from international accreditation experts because what we want to do is make sure people qualify in Ireland as vets and that accreditation is recognised as far and wide as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_872">Here I am again with the vets. At this stage, I have probably spoken to the vast majority of vets from across the island. They obviously want to get this right, as do I. I come from a farming community along the western seaboard and we have long wanted a veterinary school there. It makes sense. It does concern me when the Minister speaks of an extension of what is already there because we, in particular, have a shortage of vets for large animals that needs to be catered for. It is not like putting on any other course. It is a school that has to have the full capacity to deliver what we need in terms of veterinary. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind. I reiterate the need for an all-island approach to this. I welcome that the Minister is supportive of that. Were there an institute here in collaboration with one of the institutes in the North, would the Minister be willing to explore and support that?</p>

            <p eId="para_873">I thank the Minister and thank Deputy Carthy for tabling the question, and I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh, who has led out on this and had a priority question earlier. I come from a rural county but it is also a Border county. The two are very important when we look at this issue because there is a question of geography and access to veterinary services. We know in the evaluation that was carried out that it is the counties down the west coast - Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Kerry - that have the highest concentration of herd numbers without a veterinary practice within 20 km. It is encouraging that a number of universities have shown interest in the expression of interest that was submitted last year, but particularly the Atlantic Technological University, ATU, is one which covers the area where there is an issue with access to veterinary practice. The accreditation and recognition on an all-island basis is crucial because vets operate in one field one minute and in the next minute, they are across the Border. It needs to be internationally recognised. It needs to be all-island recognised and therefore the accreditation has to be accepted by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons as well. We need to get that right at the very start.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">I am delighted to see such an interest in veterinary medicine because, a year ago, Deputy Conway-Walsh and I were being told there were an adequate number of places, and that never felt right to any of us. That is not the position now. We are doing this scoping exercise. There will, I believe, be at least one new veterinary school at the end of this. I do not want to pre-empt the process. I have to keep neutral and external to the process going on, but the point that Deputy Doherty and others make about the regional aspect is very important. In the criteria and in the issues the institutions were asked to outline, the regional impact was one because the Deputies are right in that it is more of an issue in certain parts of the country than others and it is more of an issue with certain types of animals than others. I assure people on accreditation that the competent authority is not my Department but the Veterinary Council of Ireland. It is on the board. It is on the panel. I am not. It will have to be satisfied through its accreditation process on an all-island approach. We are about to do that with medicine and there is no reason there would not be a wish to collaborate between North and South. We would be only too delighted to consider that.</p>
            <p eId="para_875"> On workforce planning, it is for the line Department to workforce plan, so to speak. How many vets and how many veterinary places are needed in Ireland are matters for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It will come to us and we then try to provide the places. It is the same in health and any other area.</p>

            <p eId="para_876">Earlier today, we discussed legislation that could lead to a greater workload on vets. That alone has created a particular amount of unease. I welcome the Minister's assurances on all-Ireland accreditation.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">The reason we have brought this matter to his attention is because concerns have been raised with us. Veterinary Council of Ireland accreditation is the base line. It would be senseless to consider having a veterinary college which did not deliver that, but there are different levels of accreditation. The top universities in the world, when providing accredited courses, try to ensure that accreditation is recognised as far as possible. Within the EU, Veterinary Council of Ireland accreditation is recognised. The Minister mentioned the North in the context of the protocol. However, we would also like this accreditation to be recognised across the water. Large numbers of Irish veterinary students traditionally spend a year or two in places like Canada, the United States and Australia. This means that the wider the reach of the accreditation, the more valuable the course becomes and the more esteem the qualification holds.</p>
            <p eId="para_878"> I welcome the Minister’s indications, but I urge him to keep a close eye on this and ensure that, as Deputy Doherty stated, we do not drop the ball.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">I do not disagree with what the Deputy said. I referenced the EU directive in the context of mutual recognition of qualifications. I am happy to check for the Deputy, but I understand that an accredited place through the Veterinary Council of Ireland is recognised in the North, the UK and the EU, as well as in some other jurisdictions. I can seek clarity on the latter for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_880"> The process of looking at what is possible is external to me, as should be the case. Nobody wants me to decide what is appropriate for veterinary medicine. We have the chief vet, the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the HEA. My approach is to let them do their thing. I met the CEO of the HEA recently and conveyed that to him. A report will come to me in March and the matter will then be back in my space. I am happy to engage with the Deputy and his party colleague and spokesperson, Deputy Conway-Walsh, on making sure we get it right. The exercise between now and March is to ascertain what is possible, what the institutions are telling us and what the expert panel believes is best from what it has heard around the country. I am taken by the importance of that regional piece as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter repeatedly and for keeping in touch with me in respect of it. I am working actively to address the difficulties faced by students in accessing affordable student accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_884"> In recognition of the real challenge, including rising construction costs and the impact of same on the affordability of accommodation, I received Government approval on 29 November last to, for the first time ever, invest taxpayer funds in helping to build student accommodation. As the Deputy will know, because we have discussed the matter before, a number of projects were stalled which had active planning permission in five universities, UCD, DCU, Maynooth, Limerick and Galway. Trinity has got planning permission recently, so that is six. In November I got the go-ahead in relation to three, namely, Maynooth, Galway and Limerick, to provide part State funding to get those projects moving again. I have had extremely intensive direct engagements over the last couple of weeks with the presidents of UCD and DCU, separately, and their teams to try to move those projects on. I hope to be in a position to update Government on that shortly. Trinity will be engaging with them now that they have planning permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_885"> I know the Deputy’s heart and mind lies in the regions and how we can bring student accommodation into them. We also, on 29 November, made the decision to allocate seed funding, if I can call it that, of €1 million to the technological university sector to begin to develop its own plans. With the exception of Waterford - I see Deputy Ó Cathasaigh is here - there has not been a technological university or institution of technology that has built student accommodation. That is not a criticism. That is the way the rules were at the time. We need them to be able to bring in expertise, probably externally, to get a view as to what is possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_886"> I expect to shortly be in a position to outline how that €1 million will be used in a structured way. It is most likely to be used to provide a central external resource of expertise that could help all technological universities because there are probably synergies between them. I am happy to keep the Deputy updated on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_887">I thank the Minister for his reply. We are all aware of cases where student accommodation fails to meet the quality standards in many areas. Many students have reported poor living conditions, inadequate heating and ventilation, mould and damp. We need to ensure we have modern suitable accommodation. We need to look to provide such accommodation in a structured manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_888"> I encourage the adaptive reuse model, which involves converting existing buildings into student accommodation. Croí Cónaithe is an important vehicle for that in rural and urban areas, but we should be utilising it in the rental market. I hope that, in time, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, will look at that option. Co-living spaces have become increasingly popular among students. That is an important step forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_889"> Will the Minister provide an update on any public private partnerships that can help drive the delivery of student accommodation by, as he mentioned, leveraging on expertise and resources in the public and private sectors to deliver at scale and get beyond the point where, year after year, students are in real competition when the CAO offers are made?</p>

            <p eId="para_890">The Minister will not be surprised to see me coming in on this. He rightly referenced that Waterford has built on-campus student accommodation. There has been welcome Government interventions on student accommodation, particularly in the case of technological universities, which will be allowed to borrow in order to fund student accommodation for the first time. However, it means we are a little behind. The pipeline the Minister referenced consists wholly of universities that are in train. In the context of South East Technological University, and, I am sure, ATU and Technological University of the Shannon, we want to see increased numbers of students coming on campus. To allow that to happen, which we need to increase the amount of accommodation available. In my constituency, constructing purpose-built accommodation and expanding the footprint into the campus will be pivotal.</p>

            <p eId="para_891">I agree fully with both Deputies. I assure Deputy Dillon that the structured approach makes sense. If there are synergies and we know there is a model that can work for the technological university and get things moving, let us not waste time coming up with a load of different models. You notice when you drive around the country, many new schools are beginning to look the same. That is because the Department of Education got it right and that saves time in the roll-out. Nothing is off the table in terms of the modality used. In Galway, for example, they will be long-term renting some; in Maynooth, they will be direct building. It will be whatever it takes to increase supply with affordability being a key ask and interest of ours.</p>
            <p eId="para_892"> On Deputy Ó Cathasaigh's point, I met all the chairs of the technological universities in Leinster House in the last month. The chair of the South East Technological University was there. I said to him - and I am sure he will not mind me sharing this – that I want him to keep me under pressure, to say they have all these student accommodation projects in technological universities ready to rock and ask why we have not funded it yet. We are not at that point yet. I have said clearly to others we need them coming up with plans and demanding the Government funds them. We will not be found wanting in helping to get them off the ground but we need the planning to be done first. The reason the universities are going first is not a preference for them, but that they have the planning. We need the plans in place and the €1 million is about trying to enable that.</p>

            <p eId="para_893">I know the Minister is deeply committed to delivering increased numbers of student accommodation. It is crucial we get careful planning and management to ensure such student accommodation is fit for purpose, meets the needs and is supported by ample public transport. Rental prices are at an all-time high and it is making it extremely difficult for students.</p>
            <p eId="para_894"> I encourage that the application that was submitted by ATU for the old military barracks in Castlebar be given careful consideration. It is a vacant barracks in the centre of Castlebar and would make an enormous contribution to the town centre. That money should be invested in such projects to entice people into the area and support ATU and its offerings.</p>

I will familiarise myself further with the matter. He mentioned it to me previously. I will get the view of ATU and the Department. I will be happy to revert to the Deputy on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The Government will continue to do everything we can to increase supply but we are also looking at different ways in terms of helping with affordability. Of course, the actual cost of rent is one way of helping with affordability. So, too, are increased student grants, reducing registration fees and increasing the student assistance fund. We will look at many different ways of how we can reduce the pressures of the cost of education on students and their families.</p>

            <p eId="para_900">Over the past number of years, I have delivered a range of enhancements to the student support scheme to better meet the needs of students and families, and it is only right and proper that we do. Over the course of the past three budgets and, in addition, separate and distinct from the one-off cost of living measures, I have significantly increased the rate of the grant, with the most recent improvements taking effect last month. I have increased the income limit for students availing of the 50% undergraduate student contribution. I introduced a new student contribution grant reducing the student contribution to be paid by €500 for qualifying families on incomes of between €62,000 and €100,000. This will provide support to between 40,000 and 50,000 students who would not previously have been eligible for SUSI or State support.</p>
            <p eId="para_901"> We have introduced a new rental income disregard of up to €14,000 to support the rent-a-room relief scheme of which many students are availing.

We reduced the period for a break in studies from five years to three years for second-chance mature students. We have increased the income thresholds to qualify for the standard rate of student grant, reduced the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 45 km to 30 km and enhanced postgraduate supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_902"> As I did for the first time last year, it is my intention to publish a cost of education options paper, which will set out options for further enhancement of student supports for consideration as part of the budgetary process in the autumn. This is quite a good process. The Department of Social Welfare has been doing it on tax for years. We need to put the options out early. I accept that the budget was moved forward earlier last year so I would like to give people a little more time this year. We need to put out all the options and cost them at Government then let the Opposition, the public and students see the menu of options on how we reduce the cost of education. We have taken measures, however. Since my Department was established - we did not have a Department in this space before - we have taken very concrete actions to try to improve and overhaul the SUSI grant scheme. I would be the first to say we have much more to do in this space in terms of fees and grants. I intend to do more in the next budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">I thank the Minister for his response. We are all aware in this House of the importance of the SUSI grant and its role in enabling students to pursue their educational and career goals. It is an important element whereby students can have access to basic necessities in our current cost-of-living crisis around food, housing and healthcare. Certainly, it reduces the financial burden on many people and provides access to education, which is crucially important. The Minister has made significant strides to date with regard to expanding additional students into the scheme. Up to 50,000 students now have access to the SUSI grant. What priorities is the Minister making at present in terms of the review process? What will the timeline be with regard to the current review that is being undertaken?</p>

            <p eId="para_904">I wish to raise with the Minister the issue of the special rate of SUSI. There have been adjustments in the social welfare payments and cost-of-living measures. We have not seen a corresponding increase in the threshold for the special rate, however. Can the Minister assure anxious parents and students that no one will lose out on the special rate of SUSI as a result of any social welfare payment increases or the cost-of-living supports? That would go a long way towards reassuring people.</p>
            <p eId="para_905"> People are really struggling. The problem, as with every year, is that SUSI does not always reflect the financial reality of what is going on in households in terms of the money that is available or the students and families who miss out because they just miss the threshold. If the Minister could reassure those people on the special rate, it would go some way to helping families.</p>

            <p eId="para_906">I will say to Deputy Dillon that there are a number of areas in which I want to make progress. There are three in particular, one of which we discussed earlier regarding the income disregard for a student who is working a shift in a pub or hotel at the weekend and who is worried about losing his or her grant. That is something logical on which we can move fairly swiftly.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> The second issue is part-time students. I am frustrated about this and want to get it resolved. I have been very clear in relation to this. I have spoken to Professor Tom Collins, who is doing a very good job of chairing a group that is doing some work on this. This is an area on which I want to move and I believe there is unanimity across the House in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> The third area is the income threshold piece. We need to make sure that as incomes rise, which they are doing in Ireland, people can continue to access student supports. We have increased them in recent years. We need to do more. Those three areas are not exclusive or exhaustive but they are three areas in which we can make progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_909"> Deputy Conway-Walsh's question is important. We have always adopted the approach that when a person gets a social welfare rate increase, we must make sure it does not have a knock-on effect in losing another one. As the Deputy knows, SUSI is retrospective in that it goes back a year. I will be working to make sure there is no fall-out of the special rate as a result of someone getting a social welfare increase. It will be a matter for the Estimates formally but that has always been a tradition we have taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_910">I welcome the Minister's comments with regard to the income thresholds. That is a significant barrier for many applicants. I also suggest broadening the types of courses for applicants to make applications towards their eligibility. Simplifying the application process and reducing the paperwork involved would encourage more students to apply. We are inundated in our office at times with regard to the amount of paperwork that is needed. Certainly, however, that is an area that may be advantageous for people who are making applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_911">I will certainly reflect on the issue of paperwork and accessibility and so forth. As the Deputy acknowledged, SUSI staff are working extremely hard as they deal with a huge volume of applications and queries. I will talk to them to make sure it is as user-friendly a system as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_912"> With regard to that issue of broadening the types of courses that qualify, my first intention would be part-time courses because there will be many students, including some the Deputy would know in Atlantic Technological University, who may wish to or have to study part time for a whole variety of reasons. They will still end up with the same qualifications but they are doing it in a different way. If that is the starting point, there are a whole variety of part-time courses. However, I am talking about students who end up with the same qualification they would have received if they did it full time but did it part time because they are perhaps holding down a job, caring for a relative or child or have a disability and that way was just not best for them. That is the area in which I would like to move. I am in agreement with the Deputy on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_914">I will go back to where we are with accommodation for college students. The Minister announced towards the end of last year that funding had been released for 667 of the 3,000 remaining undeveloped sites. I accept that he said earlier to Deputy Conway-Walsh that he met with representatives from these colleges. When can we see progress on this? Dublin City University, DCU, has planning permission for 990 additional beds. That has been the case since 2019. Can the Minister make a statement on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_915">I can indeed. I thank Deputy Browne for the question. I will not go through the formal answer because he has heard some of it already. With regard to a straight question regarding DCU, this is something on which I hope to be in a position to make progress within a matter of weeks. I do not want to pre-empt conversations we are having with DCU or get ahead of myself but I acknowledge the really intensive and excellent way DCU has been engaging with my Department. There has been a real collaborative approach. There are many issues here, not just for DCU but in general in trying to ensure we comply with state aid rules and get a mechanism that works with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_916"> Crucially, however, we are in a housing emergency. We need to increase housing supply in general. Where universities have planning permissions, I want to get on and build. We want to help them. I am hoping to be in a position to update Cabinet on this very shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_917">I appreciate the Minister's response but the plan is a stopgap measure that still falls way short. Like I said, 667 out of 3,000 is a start but it is still does not come anywhere near what is actually needed in places like Waterford, Cork and Dublin. They have been left out of it. We are seeing the consequence of decades of underinvestment and now demand is outstripping supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">At least it is now being recognised that the strategy needs to change and bring all affordable student accommodation back into it because college accommodation has always been the right approach. I do not believe anybody will say any different. These places have the land, they have the capacity, and it seems they have the willingness to deliver on the student accommodation. We need the Minister to move on this. He stated earlier that he is waiting for them to come back with plans and that he will move then. Perhaps the Minister needs to put a bit of fire under some of these places to start getting back onto it as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_919">I assure the Deputy that I have been willing but in fairness to them, I also wish to acknowledge they are up for it too. In fairness to our universities and our technological universities, a lot of them are chomping at the bit to make progress on this. They are all at different stages, which is just a statement of fact and not a value judgment. The six traditional universities have planning permissions and they want to get on with it and we want them to get on with it. We are trying to free them up to move on, including universities in the Deputy's county, which is now a university county. The Deputy now has university campuses in his county for the first time. We want people locally from Tipperary to be able to go to university in Tipperary and in due course we also want people to come to Tipperary who want to learn there because they like that course or because that university works for them. To do that we need to be able to develop student accommodation whether it is there or in Ennis, which is in Deputy Carey's constituency. We have the €1 million that we received in November, which we want to use as seed funding. We want the technological universities to get their plans in order, bring in their expertise, tell us what they can do in Tipperary, Ennis or Castlebar, and then get on with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_920">If we assist with the students' rental situation the Minister will also assist with the wider problem, to some extent by taking the pressure off it. By its very nature, however, this kind of accommodation must be affordable. I am not talking about providing some affordable accommodation or restricting it to SUSI recipients. I am referring to all beds being offered at an affordable rates. Reference was made earlier to this. I am aware the Minister has said that it is not his Department but there is also confusion on the matter in the Revenue website. It states the number of conditions for the tax credit on accommodation where one pays the rent, including that "The property must be used by your child specifically to facilitate his or her attendance at an approved course." The same web pages state:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_921">In certain cases, the Rent Tax Credit applies for tenancies which do not need to be registered with the RTB. This includes 'rent-a-room' or 'digs' type arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">I know of families, and I have no doubt but that many Members in the House also know of such families, that are paying €1,000, €1,100 or €1,200. I was contacted by one family yesterday that has two children going to college. They are paying €1,200, but because of the anomaly in the Revenue criteria, they will not get anything. It perhaps comes back to the SUSI situation where students cannot work themselves to get a few euro. The parents are caught. Now they are being caught again for that €1,100 or €1,200 per month in rent. That needs to be looked at.</p>

            <p eId="para_923">I refer to a reply to a previous parliamentary question on the same issue so I can give the Deputy accurate information. In response to a question to the Minister for Finance on the rent credit, the reply said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_924">The intention is that, in order for a person to be in a position to claim the credit in a year:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_925">- the rent paid must be in respect of the person’s principal private residence,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_926">- the person living in the rented property themselves, or their spouse/civil partner, must have paid the rent and sufficient tax to avail of the credit,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_927">- the tenancy must be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) but only where this is already a legal requirement.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_928">Tenants in the rent-a-room scheme and in student accommodation will also be able to claim the tax credit, subject to compliance with bullet points one and two above. </p>
            <p eId="para_929">It does not say bullet point No. 3. My understanding of this has always been that a student in student accommodation could claim it and the student in the rent-a-room scheme could claim it, and that any student in another accommodation would have to be registered with the RTB. That is how I read the parliamentary question.</p>

            <p eId="para_936">I thank Deputy Troy for this question and for keeping in touch with me on the issue. I am very committed to making sure we deliver an EV centre of excellence at Columb Barracks, Mullingar. As the Deputy will be aware, I visited there previously. As recently as in the past two weeks, the chief executive of SOLAS visited there also and met the local education and training board, ETB, about this project and on a number of other issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_937"> As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is fully committed to achieving our ambitious targets set out in the climate action plan 2023. A key component of the plan is the importance of fleet electrification and a target has been set for 30% of our private car fleet to be comprised of electric vehicles by 2030. Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, ZEVI, has been established as the dedicated office charged with supporting consumers, the public sector and businesses to continue to make the switch to zero emission vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_938"> It is important that projected workforce requirements are informed by the expertise of the relevant sectoral, departmental and industry experts, with my Department contributing based upon its responsibility to align future skills needs with current and emerging workforce plans developed by the sector. In this context, my Department is supporting this transition by ensuring that through the further education and training strategies, sustainable green skills are key components of our further education and training processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_939"> I understand very well that the Longford and Westmeath education and training board, LWETB, has submitted an application to develop the new centre and an electric vehicle maintenance centre of excellence in Columb Barracks. My Department has been advised by SOLAS that a new proposal specifically relating to the electric vehicle maintenance skills centre at Columb Barracks is now being prepared by LWETB. The proposal will be subject to full evaluation by SOLAS. This is something we will see happen. I believe that Mullingar will be home to a centre of excellence for electric vehicle training. It will be a key component to roll out retrofitting. It is one of the big pieces of work we have done in the last number of years and we now have enough centres in that space and EV training will be the next one. Columb Barracks is an ideal site and location. I am fully committed, as are my Department, SOLAS, and the LWETB, to making this happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">I thank the Minister for the update. We all share the ambition of the Land Development Agency, LDA, for Columb Barracks in Mullingar for mixed use, that is, for educational, enterprise, community and housing purposes. A key part of that is a college of further education and centre of excellence for electric vehicle management.</p>
            <p eId="para_941"> I compliment the Longford Westmeath ETB on the work it has done thus far to bring the application to where it is. I also acknowledge SOLAS, the Minister and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for pushing this. We really want to see this developed in Mullingar. It is an ideal location.</p>
            <p eId="para_942"> We must acknowledge, however, that in the last weeks there has been a change in terms of the plans for Columb Barracks, Mullingar. A lease has been entered into with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. They are making space available, and rightly so, to help with the influx of refugees. In the context of timing, that lease is for 12 months, and does the Minister envisage that this will have an impact on the provision of a centre of excellence in Mullingar?</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> In previous replies, the Minister mentioned the importance of student accommodation going hand in hand with colleges. I believe there is an opportunity to retrofit the existing buildings now to help with the accommodation crisis for refugees, which we would be able to use into the future when this centre of excellence is created. </p>

            <p eId="para_944">It is certainly an interesting proposal from Deputy Troy. I share his view that it is appropriate for any space to be handed over in an emergency humanitarian situation, such as these refugees fleeing from Ukraine and for people needing international protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_945"> I am conscious that it is a very large site. I am not a terribly technical person, but I do not see this as seriously disrupting the plans there. The plans are at an advanced stage but there is still a bit of work to do in order to get to the actual delivery point. We are all aware of that but we are all very committed to making it happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_946"> I join with the Deputy in praising the Longford Westmeath ETB and its chief executive, Ms Liz Lavery, with whom I had the chance to meet on a number of occasions. As the Deputy has said, the Columb Barracks site is currently owned by the Department of Defence. It is underused, with sections occupied by community groups, youth groups, and now as part of our emergency accommodation response. The entire Columb Barracks site is proposed for redevelopment by the LDA, with mixed use. I really believe that our sector can play a part as part of that overall master plan. I am very happy to keep the Deputy closely informed and to visit and meet him and the ETB on this in the coming months.</p>

I welcome the Minister's renewed commitment, or it would be much fairer to say his continued commitment, to the development of an electric vehicle centre of excellence in Columb Barracks. I welcome that the Minister considers that it can proceed, despite what is happening in the barracks at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">Could the Minister use his position of influence within the Government to ensure that instead of putting tents into the square in the middle, that we look at renovating the existing buildings? They are protected structures and they will have to be maintained. They will offer a very good complementary facility to any future educational institution there in terms of living space for students. In the meantime, they can be used to support this country's response to the refugee crisis. The buildings are in relatively good order, and they could be brought into a habitable state relatively easily and they would be complementary to the further development of the barracks in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_949">I will certainly feed that back to my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and to the Cabinet committee on Ukraine and the major humanitarian crisis. I visited the Columb Barracks site. We were accompanied on the visit by a local historian who took us around the site, the history of which is fascinating. It is a massive site. Far be it from me to say, but I think the right approach is to try to have a mixed-use development where we can put what was a thriving beating heart of the community back into use in a modern way. Part of that would be for housing, part for education and part of it for the green revolution we need to see in terms of skills. I am very pleased that Longford-Westmeath ETB has put up its hands and offered to be leaders in this area. I am very grateful to SOLAS for taking such an active role. If we are serious about climate change and action, which we are, this EV piece is huge and the centre of excellence in Mullingar can be a hub for the entire country. I look forward to its development.</p>

            <p eId="para_953">I thank Deputy Connolly for raising this matter. On Thursday, I am due to meet the new director in SOLAS of the further education and training, FET, college of the future. I may have a further update in which case I am very happy to revert to the Deputy post Thursday, but I will exchange what I have with her now.</p>
            <p eId="para_954"> As Deputy Connolly rightly said, Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, ETB, GRETB, did superb work, which I acknowledge, in a very exciting plan for Galway city. It wants to establish a FET college adjacent to the training centre in Mervue and the Atlantic Technological University, ATU, and within walking distance of NUI Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_955"> My understanding - I am going from my memory of my visit there last winter – is that this could see further education capacity in Galway increase by up to 40% and could also see a consolidation in terms of the service provision, which I understand is a little bit higgledy-piggledy at the moment and is spread around various buildings across the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_956"> Last year, I was pleased to announce that Galway Roscommon ETB's strategic proposal to develop a further education college in Galway city was successful under the FET college of the future major projects fund. The proposal is now at the next stage of the project under the public spending code. As the Deputy correctly said, that requires the development of a preliminary business case by Galway Roscommon ETB. My Department is working closely with SOLAS in developing a number of template documents and guidance material to support ETBs in successfully completing this stage of the process. In addition, we will hold a number of workshops to assist the successful ETBs with key aspects of the process. SOLAS will be in contact with the GRETB on these important next steps.</p>
            <p eId="para_957"> The next step is to get the provision of a business case over the line. My job and that of my Department and SOLAS is to make sure they all get over the line and that we help them by making sure they comply with the public spending code. I could detect when I was there talking to staff and management of the ETB that this is a very exciting project. We are fully committed to it as a Department, and I know SOLAS is too. We will work with the ETB. This year, 2023, we will get the business case over the line and in compliance with the public spending code. I will meet Avril Behan on Thursday and I am happy to revert to the Deputy further following that meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">I appreciate that. I agree that it is a very positive news story. This college is something many people have campaigned for. It was a gaping gap in Galway in terms of further education. There was an emphasis on the technological university and the university, but this side was completely neglected, despite the fantastic work. I refer to the waste of money on rented buildings, not to mention the effect on morale of being spread all over the city. This is a great news story for Galway. What is the update on the preliminary business case since the previous question I asked about the matter? I will follow up on progress at all times. Has the preliminary business case begun yet? More importantly, when is the completion date? Could the Minister provide clarification? Exactly a year ago today, on St. Valentine's Day, the announcement was made about the €430 million for the various adult education projects. Could the Minister clarify what money has been allocated for Galway?</p>

            <p eId="para_959">I visited Galway to make the announcement on 28 November 2022. I appreciate the point that the overall fund was announced. I did not realise it was a year ago today, but there you go. It was 28 November when Galway was officially selected as one of the ten. We have now identified these ten projects. There will be more in the country, but these are the ten we want to proceed in phase 1. We do not give out the specific figure now. That is not to be difficult, but it is subject to tendering and the likes. The question of which project will move first or second of the ten will depend on a number of factors, including planning and the preparedness of the ETB. The factual position at the moment is that now that the ten have been announced - that process took us up to Christmas - in the coming weeks SOLAS will meet with each of the ETBs with the template documents and guidance material for the preliminary business case. On whether it has started, they are all very much aware of it, but the starting will formally be in the coming weeks when the guidance documents and template documents will be given out. I will revert to the Deputy on a closing date because I truthfully do not have one. The key point is that we want to make sure we get people over the line, so we have done a lot of work in making sure ETBs have very clear supporting material and templates on what needs to go into the business case.</p>

            <p eId="para_962">Will the business case be completed in the first six months of this year? When will it be completed? If I appear a bit impatient, it is because this project has been on the cards for a very long time. Going back a good few years ago, I had the privilege of being chair of the Galway Technical Institute, GTI. The institute has done great, but the building is just not suitable. With the new campus, it will be suitable as an additional building. It is exactly a year ago on this very day that the announcement was made about the €430 million for four capital projects. First, when will the preliminary business case be completed? When does the Minister envisage planning to proceed? When will the vacancies in Galway for planners be filled? The chief planner and another planner are gone. When does the Minister envisage the college going to construction? Has the money been earmarked?</p>

            <p eId="para_963">Money has been earmarked. The Deputy should please be impatient, because I am impatient. These ten projects are key to creating a unified tertiary system that will give Galway the last piece of the jigsaw - a traditional university, a technological university and a major modern further education and training college.</p>
            <p eId="para_964"> I accept the Deputy's point about the year. It has been less than three months since I made the announcement that Galway has been chosen. I was in GTI on that day. I was quite blown away by what they do, but the poor infrastructural quality was clear to me as well. Yes, the preliminary business cases need to be completed this year. The pace at which they are completed will be a matter for the ETBs. I say this directly to GRETB and all other ETBs that have been selected. Once we give them the template documents and the support and guidance, they are then empowered at a local level in the ETBs to get on with getting the best business case together as quickly as possible. The pace at which each of the ten projects move will depend on their ability to get their business case approved and their planning in place. I was very clear in Galway that day that these are projects that in their totality are four to five years from announcement to completion, but we need to sit on it to make sure it happens within that space. The year 2023 is the year of the preliminary business case. I will try to be more specific as to what stage it is at once that documentation issues and I have spoken to GRETB again.</p>

            <p eId="para_966">The Minister knows the associate membership fee of CERN is a minimum of €1.52 million annually, based on 10% of the full membership cost, which is estimated at €15.2 million annually. This is very important. Could the Minister provide an update? I know discussions have been happening on membership of CERN. As the Minister is aware, it is vitally important in so many ways.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">I am glad we got to this question because I am pleased to give an update. In November, I indicated to the House that my Department would prepare a proposal for the Government to consider joining CERN. Officials from my Department have been liaising with CERN regarding the total cost of membership, the application process and membership options. One option is for Ireland to join CERN as an associate member for a period of between three to five years and then assess the appropriateness of further membership options.</p>
            <p eId="para_969"> Any formal request by Ireland for membership is likely to involve CERN sending a task force here to carry out a formal assessment of our suitability for associate membership. This is a normal process for any member. In order to ensure appropriate engagement and examination, it is envisaged that a submission will be made to the Government in the second half of the year. It is still my intention to go to the Government in the second half of the year. I have very recently been invited by the director general of CERN to visit and meet with its staff. I intend to do that in the coming months, certainly in the first half of this year, and to make a submission to the Government in the second half of the year. I am very keen to see us join CERN, although I do not want to pre-empt the Government process. Subject to Government approval, it will then be up to CERN to send a task force and so on. We are moving on this and I am eager that we make progress.</p>

            <from>Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_970">That is welcome news. I acknowledge the work done by PhD researcher Michael Mitchell from Trinity College Dublin in pushing this. He is a young Castlebar man who recognises the importance of it. The Minister has met with him, as I have.</p>
            <p eId="para_971"> In the case of associate membership, the return to Ireland would be capped at the same level as the amount invested. To become a full member, a country must go through an obligatory associate membership phase, prior to full membership, for a minimum of two and a maximum of five years. In this instance, the initial annual membership fee would be at least 25% of the full membership cost and should increase to 100% by the first year. There is no provision in the 2023 budget for CERN membership. The earliest Ireland could join, assuming that the required funding is secured through the Estimates process, would be 2024. Should the Exchequer commitment be confirmed, Ireland can request that CERN send a task force to Ireland to carry out a formal assessment of its sustainability for associate membership. This is the normal process for associate members and the assessment could take up to a year. I am glad to see that progress has been made. </p>

            <p eId="para_972">I will be slightly cheeky and inform the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in respect of the previous question that the business cases are due to be completed by quarter 3. I had that information that I wished to share.</p>
            <p eId="para_973"> Pretty much everything Deputy Conway-Walsh said is a statement of fact. I obviously cannot get ahead of the Government process. I said in November that I was directing my Department to prepare a submission for me to bring to the Government regarding Ireland's willingness to join CERN and an application to do so. That is where we are at now. My team are working on that with a view to my bringing it to Government in the second half of the year. If the Government decides to join CERN at that stage, it will initiate the process outlined by the Deputy, including a task force and the like. Her timelines sound logical to me. Of course, there will be a fee, the level of which is to be determined. That will need to be secured in the context of the Estimates process.</p>

            <p eId="para_975">I agree. Not to stray into the Department of Education's role - there are two Departments involved - but one of the structures under Impact 2030 is to bring many Departments together that have an interest in this and for my Department to have a co-ordinating role. I will certainly feed the Deputy's comments and suggestions, with which I largely agree, back into that.</p>

            <p eId="para_978">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Chamber to deal with this matter. My request is that we establish a commissioner for ageing and older people. The role would very much be about safeguarding the interests of older people, advising the Government on matters relating to older people, promoting awareness, encouraging best practice, reviewing the adequacy of existing laws, eliminating discrimination, and promoting participation by older people in a way that we are not currently doing enough in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_979"> When we look at the way the population is changing, there are currently 768,900 people over 65 years of age. That is a substantial increase from where it was. The 2011 census indicated that, at that time, 11.7% of the population was over 65. In the more recent census, the figure was 15.1%. By 2030, more than 1 million people here will be over 65 years of age. As a result, we need to make sure we made adequate provision to protect them. This has very much come home in the past few weeks as regards the way, going back over the past 25 years, people in nursing homes were dealt with and why it ended up in challenges through the courts in order to establish particular rights. A commissioner for older people would be extremely helpful in dealing with many of the challenges now facing us. Such a position has been established in Wales since 2006 and in Northern Ireland since 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_980"> We have made changes in other areas. We have an Ombudsman for Children, for example, but we have not put the same level of protection in place for older people. A number of reports have been produced over the past number of years internationally and in Ireland. We now need to progress this matter, especially in the context of the changes that have taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_981"> I previously raised the issue of not having a legislative process in place in the context of home care. I published a Private Members' Bill in respect of this matter more than 18 months ago. We also need to progress that. A commissioner for ageing and older people would be extremely helpful in promoting and protecting that demographic as the overall population of this country changes. It is said that by 2035 there will be more than 1.1 million people over the age of 65. The number of people over 85 is also increasing dramatically. Now more than ever, there is a need to establish the role to which I refer.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_982">I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence in the context of allowing me to welcome a group of ladies to the House. They are members of the Fianna Fáil women's network, which includes many aspiring politicians. I hope the late hour we are sitting will not put them off deciding to venture into politics. They are more than welcome to Leinster House.</p>
            <p eId="para_983"> I very much thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to respond to the points raised. There is very little he said that I do not agree with. We are on the same page as regards this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_984"> By 2041, one in five people in Ireland will be over 65 years of age. We have an ageing population, which is something to celebrate. We are all living longer, healthier lives. Older people have so much to contribute. We have the best life expectancy in Europe, at 82 years, notwithstanding the difficulties we have at times in accessing certain health supports. I always view older people as an opportunity; they are never a liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_985"> The Government is firmly committed to supporting healthy and positive ageing as well as ensuring measures will be put in place to meet both the challenges and opportunities associated with this shifting demographic. The programme for Government commits to the establishment of a commission on care that will "assess how we care for older people and examine alternatives to meet the diverse needs of our older citizens".</p>
            <p eId="para_986"> Last year preliminary desk research was undertaken within the Department of Health in preparation for the establishment of a commission on care. This year the commission will be further advanced as a priority. While the scope and the terms of reference of the commission have yet to be determined, it is envisaged that consideration of matters such as whether there is a need to establish an independent commissioner for ageing and older persons will fall within the commission's remit. Alternatively, I want serious consideration given to a possible ombudsman for older people, as Deputy Burke suggested. He also mentioned safeguarding, best practice, elimination of discrimination - all things on which we all agree.</p>
            <p eId="para_987"> The commission on care will be built on strong foundations. Over the past two decades there has been significant investment in establishing robust policies and strategies on positive ageing across Departments. We know that positive ageing requires a whole-of-government approach to address the range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the lives of ageing citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_988"> My Department has taken steps to ensure policies and strategies translate into meaningful outcomes, and strong partnerships have been forged with local authorities and organisation such as Age Friendly Ireland. Those partnerships have facilitated regular engagement with our diverse older citizens which allows us to hear their lived experience. Over the past ten years, 20,000 older people have participated in consultations throughout Ireland through town hall meetings, older persons' councils, round-table discussions, focus groups and workshops. I commend specifically the older persons' councils, which do fabulous work. This engagement has been invaluable as it has ensured awareness of the diverse and evolving needs of older people in communities throughout Ireland, whether urban or rural, younger or older, diverse ethnic groups, members of the Traveller community, older people with disabilities, LGBTI+ older people or other minorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_989"> I am fully committed to ensuring there is adequate and appropriate policy, legislation and services in place to support the diverse older cohort in Ireland. Being two and a half years into my role as Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Burke might ask why I have not worked on this earlier. As he himself will know, however, through all the various conversations we have had and the challenges we have had with older people, the nursing home sector and daycare centres, that is where the focus is. My focus, however, has very much turned to this now and this particular cohort, and I look forward to progressing this as a matter of priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_990">If the office were established, my understanding is that the cost would be around €2 million. That €2 million would be a very good investment in dealing with this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_991"> I go back to 2004, when I wore a different cap and I acted in a legal capacity for many elderly people in nursing homes. As a result of that challenge in 2004, we brought about a sea change over the following three or four years in how we dealt with people who were having to go into nursing homes for care. We set up the fair deal scheme, which is a very good scheme. Likewise, we need now to make sure we have a very comprehensive package in respect of home care.</p>
            <p eId="para_992"> The other challenge we have is that as people get older there are an increasing number with dementia. I think there are more than 64,000 people with dementia in Ireland now. The figure may be higher, but that is the figure I have established. They are people who need particular protection and support.</p>
            <p eId="para_993"> There are two other sea changes in Ireland. One is the fact that families are smaller now and, therefore, there is not the same level of support that was there, say, 25 or 30 years ago. The second, which will be a challenge not so much in the next ten years but certainly in the next 20 years is people who were not born here in Ireland but who have moved here and do not have any immediate family support. As they get older they will need protection and the necessary level of support needs to be put in place. Therefore, we should have a commissioner identifying all these issues and working with a Minister, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to make sure the challenges people who are retired face can be adequately looked after. It would be a huge achievement for the Minister of State to deliver on this while she holds her role. I thank her again for all the work she is doing in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_994">I thank the Deputy for the support he has always afforded to me. We all have a common desire to have the best possible policies and services in place for older people. That process starts by ensuring we identify the growing and diverse needs of older people. I want to see older people being able to age in place and being able to live in their own communities for as long as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_995"> We do that by supplying three different types of supports. The first support is daycare services and dementia daycare services. The second is home care. My budget this year to provide home care supports for older people is €700 million. The third is meals on wheels. I actually had a meeting about that today and I am delighted to say that I secured an extra €1.75 million in this year's budget to support the numerous people who deliver meals on wheels. Meals on wheels is so much more than a nutritious meal being dropped at your door. It is that knock on the door and that social contact you might not normally have, especially for people living in rural isolation. Some 400,000 meals are delivered monthly.</p>
            <p eId="para_996"> Also, 56,000 people receive home care every single day, notwithstanding the fact we have a waiting list of 3,200 people. That is funded, but we cannot put all the staff in place. Thankfully, however, since 1 January of this year, 1,000 permits for those from outside the EU have been put in place. I am very hopeful that by February or March we might see a result on that. There are currently 2,640 permits being used for healthcare workers who came in from other countries to work in nursing homes, so I am positive from that perspective that it will yield a return.</p>
            <p eId="para_997"> I hope to have the commission on care established by the middle of this year. I will engage with all the stakeholders and, of course, the Deputy himself.</p>

          <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_402">
            <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T21:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_998">I am here to discuss crime and antisocial behaviour in Cabra. I want to say before I do that I do not believe Cabra is by any means different from any other part of the city or the country. Cabra is a very well-settled place full of people who love living there. Why would they not? There are issues in Cabra, as there are throughout other parts of Dublin, with an element of antisocial behaviour and some degree of crime. The issues in Cabra are by no means out of control, lawless or any different from what has happened over the past half a decade, ten years or beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_999"> What is different is that people in Cabra believe that when something does happen - some degree of antisocial behaviour or, as we have seen recently, incidents where motorbikes have been burnt or where there have been large congregations of people engaged in fights and that sort of carry-on - there have not been any gardaí around. That is probably indicative of a trend emerging throughout the country whereby we simply do not see gardaí on the streets. When a call is made for whatever reason, be it a burglary, a domestic violence report or some form of antisocial behaviour happening outside a person's home, the Garda is called and gardaí may arrive the next day or the day after that. It has led to a sense that, to some degree, the gardaí are no longer themselves capable of providing an adequate standard of policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000"> I raised this issue specifically in the context of Cabra because I have had a couple of meetings with residents there in recent weeks and months, but I could have raised it about anywhere. I simply want to ask Deputy Harris, in his capacity as Minister for Justice, what is the plan. We read reports yesterday of dwindling Garda numbers. One of the figures given was that, in November 2022, we had 13,907 gardaí, down from 14,750 in March 2020. I assure the Minister that I do not believe there is solely a policing solution to antisocial behaviour - far from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">I believe in a multifaceted approach that involves: encouraging youth clubs; engaging with sport; positive role models; and engagements through our education systems. However, at a certain point we also just want to see some gardaí on the street. I am coming to the Minister on behalf of the people of Cabra - and also to talk about Dublin Central more broadly - and to ask what the plan is.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonHarris" as="#Minister_for_Justice" eId="spk_403">
            <from>Minister for Justice (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T22:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1002">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and I take the point he makes about multifaceted approaches and solutions. I know he believes in community safety partnerships, diversion programmes and all of that, as do I, but we will take that as read and for another day because he is raising a specific issue, that is, the policing and criminal justice response to issues where antisocial behaviour and crime can emerge in a community. In this case he is highlighting issues in the Cabra part of his constituency and I thank him for doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003"> I am acutely aware of the damaging and potentially devastating impact that assaults and public order incidents can have on local communities. This criminal behaviour threatens both individual and community safety and I am unequivocal in my condemnation of it. Everybody has a right to feel safe and to be safe in their homes and communities. The Deputy will appreciate that the policing response to all incidents involving criminality, including the deployment of Garda resources at local level, are operational matters for An Garda Síochána in the first instance. I assure him that his comments on some of the issues he mentioned are sent to the Garda Commissioner and that he is aware of the perspective he is delivering on behalf of his constituents in Cabra.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004"> I am advised that Garda management carefully monitors the incidence of all crime and that Garda resources are deployed in response to changing crime trends. This may include directing resources at areas that can be designated as hotspots from to time to time for public order or other criminal behaviour. I have received an update from An Garda Síochána on the incident which took place in Ashtown in Dublin in the last weekend in January. I understand a number of migrant men temporarily camping in the area were threatened by another group of men. This incident is the focus of a live and open Garda investigation and therefore I cannot comment further on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005"> However, I want to assure communities that there is a range of legislation under which threats and intimidation can be prosecuted, including: the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act 1997; public order legislation; and incitement to hatred legislation. I should add the new hate crime Bill, which I hope we can receive support for across the House and which we hope to enact by the summer. This will further strengthen the existing legislation. More broadly, the Government is rolling out a number of policy and legislative initiates which will reduce the level of public order incidents in local communities, including introducing legislation to provide for body worn cameras for gardaí and community CCTV schemes. I intend to enact the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 swiftly, to allow the Garda to commence a body worn camera pilot this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006"> I intend to roll out the community safety innovation fund to drive the development of community safety projects at a local level. I intend to examine the use of antisocial behaviour orders to ensure they are as effective as possible, and considering the number of strikes attached to each order. I intend to introduce legislation to criminalise the grooming of children. I published legislation on this recently and it is so important that we never give the view that crime pays or can be a glamorous life when we know the heartache and pain it can bring and how it can ravage a community. I also intend to provide the Garda with new powers to seize and stop the illegal use of scrambler bikes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007"> At the end of 2017, I understand that the Dublin metropolitan region west division had a total of 672 gardaí, supported by 52 Garda staff. These figures rose to 721 gardaí, supported by 71 Garda staff, at the end of 2022. In Cabra, the number of Garda members has risen from 59 gardaí at the end of 2017 to 62 gardaí at the end of last year. I can confirm to the Deputy that Garda authorities have advised me that additional gardaí have been reallocated to Cabra station, in addition to a new Garda vehicle to provide further support to the local community in Cabra. I am assured by An Garda Síochána that these allocations have provided an ability to respond to calls and provide proactive and high-visibility patrols in a more timely manner. I am also advised by the Garda that there has been an increase in proactive patrols in the Cabra area and that this has resulted in a reduction in public order issues. More gardaí have been reallocated to Cabra, there is a new Garda vehicle there and more proactive patrols are what the Garda is detailing to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008"> More broadly, I want to agree with the Deputy about the need to get Garda numbers up. We have funded An Garda Síochána to recruit 1,000 new Garda members into the Garda College in Templemore this year. That will be key to ensuring that Garda numbers begin to rise towards the end of this year and that we get to 15,000 or more gardaí by the end of 2024.</p>

          <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_404">
            <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T22:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1009">Cabra is situated in such a place that when gardaí need to be reallocated to other parts of the north side, it usually has to take the brunt of that. With the recent spate of protests, which I am reluctant to call them, or the engagements in which the Garda was involved, it was Cabra Garda station that lost some of its gardaí to go to those scenarios. Cabra is also situated beside the Phoenix Park so in terms of going to police Áras an Uachtaráin, Cabra loses its gardaí. That is also a situation that happens with the gardaí outside Leinster House; Pearse Street gardaí are reallocated up here. That is something we need to consider where there are buildings that need to be policed by gardaí on a 24-hour basis. It should not be local and community Garda stations that lose their gardaí in those instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010"> I take the Minister's point on the action that has been taken with a new Garda patrol car. That will make a difference but it is there because there has been a spate of increased antisocial behaviour there. I also want to make the following request. A new Garda station will be opened on O'Connell Street and I implore the Minister to ensure that as that Garda station is staffed the gardaí are not taken from surrounding stations such as Store Street and Cabra. That has a genuine knock-on effect and there is a belief in some of these communities that when issues happen, such as the new surveillance on O'Connell Street following the "Prime Time" documentary, issues simply get pushed up and away. We need more community policing on the streets. When they are there our gardaí do a good and effective job and we need more of them. The community has a right to want to feel safe and protected at a time when it needs that protection. We need to do whatever we can to improve pay and conditions to ensure we can recruit gardaí and people into our Garda force because we need more of them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_405" as="#Minister_for_Justice">
            <from>Deputy Simon Harris<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T22:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1011">I thank Deputy Gannon for highlighting what is an important issue to his community. More broadly, the issue of antisocial behaviour and feeling safe in one's community is one that applies to his constituency and to all our communities across the country. On Cabra specifically, I am pleased to confirm to the House that the Garda has informed me that additional gardaí have been allocated to Cabra recently and that it has the new Garda vehicle attached to Cabra Garda station. The Garda is telling me, and I appreciate that the Deputy has a much closer perspective on this than me, that the more proactive patrols are achieving an improvement in terms of a reduction in the number of public order offences and incidents, and I know it monitors that closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012"> The Deputy is not wrong that it is about growing Garda numbers in general. I never like to pit specialist units against community gardaí because we need both, and the Deputy has not done that either. Specialist units in this capital city and in all of our communities, including emergency response units, drugs units and organised crime units, are playing a crucial role. We also want to see a growth in community policing. We want to see gardaí back out on the beat, walking the streets and knowing their communities. Under the new community policing model it is the intention for every community to know the name of their community garda and to have a contact number and email address for them. To do that we have to grow the Garda numbers. That is why we have given the Garda Commissioner and the Garda money to recruit 1,000 new gardaí this year. Around 350 gardaí retire from the force every year, on average, so that will enable us to see growth in overall Garda numbers during the course of the year. The Commissioner has said clearly that he wants 15,000 and more gardaí. That is where we want to get to.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013"> We can get there and the Garda College is back open. I am not blaming Covid for everything because sometimes that can be too convenient an excuse but at the same time Covid did close the Garda College on a number of occasions and that definitely had an impact. The college is back open and a new class is due to go in during the coming weeks. Another class will go in roughly every ten weeks for the rest of this year. I hope these additions to Cabra will make a difference, I will feed back the Deputy's comments to the Garda authorities and I am happy to keep in touch on it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T22:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1014">On the back of years of campaigning, principally by the International Transport Workers Federation, ITF, the situation for non-European migrant fishers working on Irish-flagged fishing vessels has improved in recent months. A highly restrictive atypical work permit scheme has been abolished and all documented fishers and a significant cohort of undocumented fishers have obtained stamp 4 visas, giving them full labour market access. Those who choose to remain in fishing ought now to be able to earn a share of the catch on an equal footing with their Irish and European crewmates. Future non-European crew, if required, will have to be recruited on one of the more advantageous Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment work permits, guaranteeing a minimum of €30,000 per year, almost 50% more than the atypical scheme minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015"> This is all welcome but work remains to be done. Most significantly, the agreement the State made with the ITF almost four years ago to, among other matters, which gives the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, jurisdiction to hear complaints from fishers on breaches of working time regulations, has still not been honoured, leaving fishers as the only private sector workers in the State who do not have an effective remedy for experiencing excessive hours of work or insufficient rest and breaks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">That needs to be sorted out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017"> This Topical Issue debate concerns the plight of non-European fishers working in Irish territorial waters on foreign-flagged fishing vessels. Two Spanish-owned German-flagged vessels have been detained by the Naval Service in recent weeks - the <i>Pesorsa Dos</i> and the <i>Ortega Tres</i>. The skippers of both vessels have been hauled before Bandon District Court on dozens of fisheries and maritime offences. However, largely forgotten in all of this are the mainly Indonesian crew on both vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018"> The International Transport Workers' Federation, ITF, have given me sight of a contract of one of the crew of the <i>Ortega Tres</i>. These contracts promised them a mere €800 per month and illegally claim that there is no limit on the hours the fishers must work for that €800.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019"> It remains to be seen if these are the same contracts that the German authorities, the flag state, have on file for these crew. I say this because the ITF has shown me a sample of a double contract that Indonesian fishers on the other vessel, the <i>Pesorsa Dos</i>, are on. In these instances, the contracts filed with the German authorities portray the crew on superior conditions that meet German regulations than what is in the parallel contract issued to the crews themselves. In the sample I have, the official contract has the fisher on €2,000 per month but the version given the fisher promises €1,000, although in his case he was not even paid that having been voluntarily repatriated from the State last week without having received a cent since boarding that vessel in late December. Indeed, none of the remaining Indonesian crew on the <i>Pesorsa Dos</i> have received any wages since December - not one cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020"> The authorities in the State are aware of the situation. However, Ireland's failure to ratify the 2007 Work in Fishing Convention, International Labour Organization, ILO, 188, leaves the likes of the Marine Survey Office and the Workplace Relations Commission powerless to follow this up.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021"> The review of the now-abolished atypical work permit scheme published last October included a promise that Ireland would ratify ILO 188. The question for the Minister is, when?</p>

            <p eId="para_1022">I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue. I have been asked to point out that the matter, although important in the area of fisheries, is not the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is lead on the International Labour Organization, ILO, and the Department of Transport would be central on the specific issue of ratification of that particular ILO convention given that Department's lead responsibility for maritime safety, manning and working hours on board fishing vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023"> The Work in Fishing Convention, C. 188, was adopted at the 96th session of the International Labour Conference in June of 2007 and entered into force in November of 2017. It aims to ensure decent conditions of work in fishing with regard to minimum requirements for work on board, conditions of service, food and accommodation, occupational safety and health protection, medical care and social security.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024"> Ireland supports the convention and must bring it into force via national primary legislation. A provision will be included in the merchant shipping (international conventions) Bill, which will allow the Minister for Transport to make regulations to fulfil the State's commitments under the Work in Fishing Convention. The general scheme for this Bill is currently in preparation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025"> In the meantime, Council Directive EU 2017/159 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. This directive contains a social partnership agreement, completed on 21 May 2012, which aims to implement the Work in Fishing Convention. This directive was transposed into Irish law in full in 2020 by way of several regulations. The regulations covered issues such as manning, hours of work and rest, minimum age, medical examinations, medical care on board, fishing vessel owner liability and repatriation, crew lists, fisherman work agreements, food and accommodation. It applies to all fishermen working under contract abroad an Irish-registered fishing vessel and share-fishermen when working along with fishermen under contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026"> The Department of Transport will continue to progress work on the merchant shipping (international conventions) Bill in order to formally ratify the provisions of the ILO Work in Fishing Convention in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">Is it not an embarrassment to the State that the ITF's fisheries representative in Ireland has to go to his colleagues in Spain, which has ratified ILO 188, and the flag state, Germany, to work on having questions of unpaid wages and illicit double contracts acted upon? One cannot help but draw the conclusion that there is a greater premium being placed on fish stocks in our territorial waters than the rights and welfare of human beings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031"> Let us be clear, this is an incursion of slave-wage conditions onto the shores of the State. Even generously assuming that the Indonesian crew of the <i>Ortega Tres</i> works, say, a 40-hour week, that would make their hourly rate €4.40, only one third of the statutory minimum wage. By comparison, future non-Europeans recruited to work on Irish-flagged vessels will have to be on a minimum rate of almost €15 an hour before they get their stamp 4 and graduate to share the catch. We hear a lot about the Common Fisheries Policy, but it is clear we are some way off from a common floor of decent pay and conditions within Europe when it comes to pay and conditions for migrant crew.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032"> If any of the dozens of charges of fisheries and maritime offences against the skippers of those two Spanish-owned German-flagged vessels is upheld in the courts, it follows that the Indonesian crew were coerced into illegal acts by their employer. Coercion into law-breaking activity is an internationally-recognised indicator of forced labour and human trafficking. While such an eventuality will be taken up with the German and Spanish authorities by the ITF, the fact that such practices can happen in Irish waters and, from the point of view of the crew, go unchallenged by the Irish authorities is deplorable. It underlines why the ratification of ILO 188 needs to be put on the agenda of the Oireachtas forthwith.</p>

            <p eId="para_1033">I thank the Deputy. He made a clear distinction between the plight of fishermen who are working on Irish-registered ships and those who are working on foreign-registered ships within Irish waters. While progress has been made on those on Irish-registered ships, and the Deputy has acknowledged that, we have not yet implemented the Work in Fishing Convention but it is the intention of the State to bring this into force through primary legislation - the merchant shipping (international conventions) Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034"> I acknowledge that workers who are on ships are uniquely vulnerable. They are often recruited from places such as the Philippines or from eastern Europe, from Ukraine, etc., and they are not in a position to stand up for their rights. They are literally marooned in a situation where they need support and representation and that is why a convention such as this is so important.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035"> The Deputy is doing the right thing by raising this issue. I will remind the two Ministers involved, the lead Minister, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Minister for Transport, of the Deputy's desire and their obligation to bring this into law.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">Before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle starts the clock, I would like to say that I would have hoped that one of the Ministers of Education would be here. Romance is in the air tonight and there is important business on outside the Dáil in terms of people's romantic lives, but there are three Ministers and I had been hoping one of them would be here. I trust that the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will take back the information and see that it is followed up on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041"> The issue I want to raise is St. Fergal's College in Rathdowney, founded in 1937. It still does not have a physical education, PE, hall 86 years later. It is the only secondary school in the county that does not have a PE hall. In 2010, the then Department of Education and Skills approved a plan along with extra classrooms. The classrooms were provided. They were constructed but no hall, because the money has not been provided since.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042"> Planning permission is in place - this is important - and the board of management and Laois County Council have ensured that that is rolled over and has been kept up to date. This is a shovel-ready project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043"> This school is located in a rural area in Rathdowney. What is important about it is it serves a large catchment area of Durrow, Cullahill, Arles, Borris-in-Ossory, Knockaroo, back around to Cuddagh and taking in Ballacolla. However, that catchment areas does not have a sports hall in the community either.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">These are the facts we are dealing with. The school population is increasing and it has excellent staff. I have visited the school many times and it has really committed staff who are doing their best to provide first-class education but they need to have the facilities. There are 330 pupils in the school now and this number is expected to increase by 16% in September, based on 2021 figures. There are Ukrainians to be housed in the town, for whom modular homes are being built. They will need school places and hopefully they will be accommodated. I know the people of Rathdowney will do their best in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045"> The school currently has a small general-purpose hall that I have visited, which serves as a canteen, a meeting room, an assembly room, a storage room and a multitude of other uses. It is totally unsuitable and too small for any meaningful PE classes. There is also another issue. Leaving certificate PE, which is now an examination subject, cannot be provided at the school. The school cannot provide it because it does not have a PE hall. There is also the issue of disabled persons' access and use. In a school of this size, there will be pupils with disabilities and we must treat those children equally. That is what this is about. St. Fergal's College has a strong tradition in sport, particularly in hurling, and people in the midlands will know that south Laois is the strong end of the county where the hurling is very good. St. Fergal's College has played a key role in camogie, Gaelic football, soccer and athletics over the years. We know the benefits of physical activity. We know how important this is in terms of countering obesity and for the promotion of good health in children. I have raised this matter many times with the Department and the Minister for Health. It is a question of funding. We have been told we must wait for phase 2 of the national development plan, which is due to kick off later this year. Will the Minister of State ensure the case is brought back to and pushed forward by the Government in order that this school is treated properly and this project gets under way?</p>

            <from>Deputy Ossian Smyth<recordedTime time="2023-02-14T22:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1046">The Minister for Education has asked me to answer this question on her behalf. This provides me with the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the Department of Education's plans for upgrading school buildings, including St. Fergal's College, Rathdowney, County Laois. The Deputy may be aware that St. Fergal's College is a multidenominational, co-educational, post-primary school in the town of Rathdowney. In 2022, the school had an enrolment of 334 pupils. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Department approved capital funding for the college in 2022 for the provision of four general classrooms, including two general classroom prefab replacements, as well as classrooms for students with special educational needs. It is proposed this accommodation would be procured under the Department's new sustainable accommodation framework. The sustainable accommodation procured under the framework is timber frame with low-carbon and high-energy performance, in support of the Department's climate action goals. The project was devolved to the school's patron, Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board, for delivery, with the initial approval letter issued to the education and training board on 9 September 2022. The Department's planning and building unit also received, as part of the additional school accommodation, ASA, application in November 2021 a request from St. Fergal's College seeking capital funding for the provision of a PE hall. The school authority was informed in writing at that time that funding for PE halls is not included under the parameters of ASA scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047"> My Department has a strong track record of delivery of school building projects and this was achieved again in 2022, despite the wider construction sector environment of high inflation, labour shortages, and supply-chain issues. Approximately 180 school building projects were delivered during 2022 and a further 273 school building projects continued in construction at start of 2023, most of which will be completed in 2023. I appreciate the strong support provided by the Government for our education budget. As part of the supplementary budget, €300 million in additional capital funding was provided in 2022. This helped to alleviate capital funding pressures that arose in 2022, which was reflected of the strong delivery by the Department of school building projects, particularly to support mainstream provision and special educational needs provision. The Department's overall capital outturn for 2022 was €1.12 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048"> The Department's planning and building unit is currently assessing its work programme and priorities for 2023 in the context of its available funding. The Department's published national development plan allocations for 2023 is €860 million. High construction inflation remains a continuing feature of the construction sector for 2023. As part of its planning ahead for 2023, the Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in respect of capital funding pressures in order to continue to be able to adequately support the operation of the school system with the roll-out of school building projects to construction in 2023. Key priorities for the Department's work programme include continuing strong delivery to support the operation of the school system, with particular regard to planning ahead for the 2023-24 school year and beyond, as well as to supporting special needs provision. Investment and expenditure on PE halls is an element of this programme expenditure an investment in school building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049"> Under the national development plan, there will be a strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock. This will have different strands and will include a PE build and modernisation programme, which will enable students in post-primary schools to have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision, particularly in context of the roll-out of PE as leading certificate subject. Enhanced and modernised PE facilities will also provide important amenities for local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050"> I again thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to outline the Department's position. The Department has approved additional accommodation for St. Fergal's College using the new sustainable modular accommodation framework. This accommodation will provide additional general-purpose classrooms, as well as including provisions of students with special needs. As the Deputy will appreciate, the provision of school places, including for children with special needs, is a priority for the Department. Funding for PE halls is outside the scope of the Department's additional school accommodation scheme, but it will be considered as part of a future modernisation programme under the national development plan. The Department will continue to work to delivered building projects in support of the operation of the school system, with particular regard to planning ahead for the 2023-24 school year and beyond, in addition to supporting special needs provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. This is about playing catch-up. This is about the children of Rathdowney and south Laois having the same opportunities and facilities as everyone else. As I said, the school opened in 1937. My father went there in the 1940s and those classrooms are still there. I welcome the fact the new classrooms were approved. This is welcomed by all and sundry, including the staff, board of management and pupils and I certainly welcome it as a local representative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052"> Any significant school needs to have functioning PE hall. It needs to have it for all the reasons I have outlined. The Minister of State said the Department is currently assessing capital projects and funding of future programmes in the 2023-24 year. I want this school to feature highly. In terms of the demographics of the area and the progress the school has made, it needs this facility. I want this included in the programme and I want the Minister of State to bring back this very strong message to the Minister, Deputy Foley. This is really important. We cannot have south Laois left behind the rest of the country. The children of south Laois cannot be left behind. An 86-year wait is a long time. I want to see this project brought on. There has been substantial investment in schools, all of which is welcomed. I have been at many of the openings of those schools around my constituency of Laois-Offaly. In this Dáil term, I want to see this project nailed down once and for all in order that we can get it up and running. It is shovel-ready and that it is good to go. Let us get on with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">I hear the Deputy loud and clear. He wants St. Fergal's College, Rathdowney, to be provided with a PE hall in the interests of equity and he wants me to take that message back to the Minister, Deputy Foley. I will do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054"> The current situation is that the existing additional schools accommodation scheme does not include provision for PE halls and yet the national development plan is a more than €100 billion capital scheme. In future iterations of the plan, or future schemes developed for the Department of Education, consideration will be made to include PE halls. Not just that, that they will include a PE hall build and modernisation programme to ensure students in all post-primary schools will have access to appropriate facilities in order to support PE provision, particularly in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving certificate subject.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055"> I take the Deputy’s points that if we are going to have PE as a leaving certificate subject, the question arises as to how it can be done without having a PE hall in place; that there is a need for a PE halls in a country that is not always dry in order that students can participate in sports indoors; that having healthy students is part of the preventive health and public health programme for the country; and that it saves us money in the long term if students are getting their physical education in school. This applies to everybody, not just those students who are sporty and able to catch a ball. Plenty of sports can be done indoors – the kind of ones that I did – and are good for general health rather than those that are overly competitive or which can be done outside in a field. I see where the Deputy is coming from and I will take his comments back to the Minister and tell her what he has said today.</p>
